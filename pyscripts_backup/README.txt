readme

this is a python script broken up into several manual steps

1 - RUN pybuk.py takes a pdf file and creates a plaintext file
2 - manually separate each chapter in a txt file?? this step can probably be more efficient
3 - RUN multiblok.py to prepare each chapter in 600 word edible chunks for chat gpt
4 - RUN dehi.py to remove page break hyphenations 
5 - should be clean enough to put into logseq and further into chatgpt
