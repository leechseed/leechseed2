This episode is sponsored by Skillshare.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.830
You might have lived in some places you thought
were real holes.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.420
But for future residents of the Moon, that
would actually be a good thing...

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.800
So today we’re returning to the Moon, something
humans haven’t physically done in the almost

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.039
50 years since the Apollo program. That will
be fairly important to our discussion today

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.699
about setting up large scale and permanent
facilities in craters on the Moon, because

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.039
when we think about going back to the Moon
a major question that always comes up is “Why?”

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.199
And what will be achieved by walking around
collecting rock samples for a few days?

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.499
And the answer to that really is “not much”.
Those Apollo rock samples were of great scientific

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.550
worth and more would be handy but not enough
to justify a mission there at outrageous expense

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.890
and more than a bit of danger. And why wouldn’t
we just send robotic sampling missions? That’s

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.700
a lot of why the US hasn’t gone back and
nobody’s worked too hard to be the second

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.050
to get there. It’s also why when we talk
about returning we tend to talk seriously

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.080
about long term or permanent facilities. Not
only would a permanent base let us get some

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.490
serious science done, but it allows us to
begin exploiting the Moon as a gateway to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.811
space development and off-world industry,
as we looked at last time in Moon: Industrial

00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:30.680
Complex.
Inevitably when the topics of bases on the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.560
Moon and where to locate them come up, the
popular answer tends to be one of the major

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.020
craters and usually one of the ones nearer
the poles. We’ll explain why that is today

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.820
but also some reasons that’s not always
ideal or necessary. Polar craters probably

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.050
are our best bet, as we’ll see today, but
there are some good competitors, such as equatorial

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.050
craters or lava tubes.
Our focus today though will be on how such

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.440
cities will look and how those communities
might develop. We’re interested in cities

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.630
and settlements, not early bases, stations,
or outposts. So we have to start by explaining

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.560
why certain places are attractive as colony
locations.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.049
To do that, we must first say that these craters
are often huge. Now, the Moon is covered in

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.290
craters and the vast majority of them are
tiny, but most folks picture a moon crater

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.269
as several meters across or maybe the size
of a football stadium. And of course many

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.159
are, but the ones we tend to be interested
in and talk about for bases are much larger,

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.310
and we have craters on the moon larger than
most nations on Earth.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.879
Now while a crater is usually a lot shallower
than they are wide, this still means the big

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.799
ones can have rim walls many kilometers high
and basins many kilometers deep. That tends

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.379
to make us think of big domes over these mostly
circular craters, be it the small ones or

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.069
big ones, their shape having the potential
to facilitate construction of a dome is not

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.959
the reason for our interest in craters, rather,
the steep and high sides is what we are interested

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.139
in..
A big deep crater that gets little sunlight

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.739
can, we believe, get a lot of ice and other
elements down in that bottom, which is obviously

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.300
a big boon for any developing base or colony.
Those rim walls are an even bigger deal though,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.639
because the moon has very long nights and
also has no atmosphere, so when the sun sets

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.799
it gets way darker.
If you’re on a mountain, you’ll see the

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.650
Sun set later than those on the ground do,
and not by a small amount either. This is

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.090
even more the case on our airless moon that
is a lot less wide than Earth and much more

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.389
sharply curved. As an example, on Mount Everest
on Earth, you can see about 230 miles or 370

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.930
kilometers away. That’s almost 1% of the
Earth’s circumference, so the Sun is going

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.829
to rise about 1% earlier and set 1% later
there as a result. That probably doesn’t

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.769
sound like too much, but it does mean the
day starts 14 minutes earlier and ends 14

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.969
minutes later, if it were at the equator anyway.
For stuff like solar power and agriculture

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.879
that’s not a trivial difference. It’s
far more extreme on the Moon, about seven

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.010
extra hours of daylight is added to any position
that high up on the Moon on its equator.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.110
However, that much extended daylight time
is not because the Moon is less wide. Indeed,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.849
the horizon is actually closer to you as a
result. If you transplanted Mount Everest

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.410
to Moon, you’d only be able to see half
as far before the horizon was reached, and

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.550
that horizon distance covers when the Sun
sets or rises. Rather, what mostly controls

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.870
that altitude-induced extension of the day
length is that the Moon’s day is a month

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.090
long. So being up high is less effective than
on Earth for letting you see far distances,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.669
but that’s more than counteracted by that
really long day.

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.900
The reverse is also true, that being in a
crater at the bottom will massively shorten

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.449
your horizon and thus your daylight hours
too, which makes for a very big temperature

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.180
difference between rim wall peaks, crater
bottoms, and general lunar surface – there’s

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.479
obviously no sea level on the Moon, not yet
anyway. We can take advantage of that temperature

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.930
difference, by using heat engines, solar thermal
power, to make some pretty efficient power

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.930
generators, but more on that later.
Now, I mentioned what these are like on the

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.680
equator but it’s different at the poles.
As an example, on a sphere that was spinning

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.310
on the exact same plane as the sun it orbited,
no axial tilt, the north and south pole never

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.800
actually get dark, there’s no rock rotating
between you and your light source. Almost

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.960
everything has an axial tilt and indeed the
Moon has one relative to Earth, which it orbits,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.139
and relative to the Sun, which Earth orbits.
So the poles of the Moon do get dark. However

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.240
you don’t need to be up too high there to
be sticking up so much that you get constant

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.740
sunlight, and indeed those bigger crater rim
walls near the poles stick up enough that

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.710
they get an awful lot more light than the
half on, half off, you would expect to get

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.990
on a smooth rotating body.
What’s more, there is no air there so there

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.289
is no wind, and the gravity is weaker, so
it’s very easy to build tall skinny towers

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.300
on the moon with great big parabolic mirrors
on them shining light down onto that crater.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.879
Done right, you can keep sunlight on there
for a very long portion of the lunar day,

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:09.970
even rotating some away on a 24 hour schedule
to mimic something earth-like.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.110
So that’s our first big concept change when
looking at crater cities. They’re not a

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.960
big crater with a big dome on them. Indeed,
a single dome is mostly rather pointless,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.180
it’s vulnerable to catastrophic failure
and has to be built all at once. At most you

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.879
might have a big crater basically bubble-wrapped
in smaller domes built as needed with another

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:34.409
big one over top as a secondary shell or shield.
Instead what we’d expect initially is a

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:39.229
few small facilities inside a given crater
with some rim wall towers with mirrors on

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:44.259
them that also served as transmitters. Along
that rim wall you’d see towers stretching

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.130
up high enough to be able to keep catching
the Sun and beaming it down to the crater

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.349
wall, or the smaller facilities in it initially,
adding more towers as you went. Those would

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:58.759
probably swivel their light away on a 24 hour
basis to simulate daytime better. That excess

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.310
light in night-phase probably being cast onto
some of the thermal wadis we discussed for

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.439
solar thermal power generation in the Industrial
Complex episode. Indeed, if LED lighting is

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.690
the preferred method of illumination for manned
facilities, beamed and piped light may be

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:19.139
limited to industrial uses and growing food.
I should also note that you’d likely be

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:24.200
using mirrors for lighting farms as opposed
to classic domes anyway. Everything weighs

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.270
less there, so it’s very easy to scoop up
tons of rock and pile them on top of structures

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.120
for added protection, you can then bounce
light in, filtered of harmful frequencies

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.659
of light, through windows on the side to a
reflective ceiling that lights the place up.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:43.879
Those windows can be down tunnels so you have
thick walls too and with pressure sensitive

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:49.100
hatches able to slam shut if the window was
damaged. This approach is a little more work

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.889
intensive than a dome to initially build,
but far sturdier, safer, and probably more

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:57.650
productive and cheaper to maintain in the
long term.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.469
As time goes on you’d add more towers and
bigger mirrors to that rim wall. Depending

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:06.720
on crater size you might need millions of
people to comfortably fill such a crater and

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.931
it could easily spill out onto the outside
of the crater wall and the plain beyond. You

00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:16.379
also have the option of foregoing those towers
in favor of satellites that beam down power

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:21.979
and light and signals too, but I suspect the
towers will tend to be the preferred method.

00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:26.039
Transmission is a big deal on the moon as
we only have line of sight, no atmospheric

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:31.930
bouncing of signals, and that horizon is shorter,
so everything has to be via tall towers or

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.010
off satellites. That’s not for communicating
home to Earth particularly, one side of the

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:42.089
moon always points at Earth and the other
side does not. Those dark-side bases, at least

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:46.100
dark in terms of having line of sight to Earth,
that are fairly near the Earth-Side might

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.180
employ very large towers or multiple towers
serving as relay stations to achieve a direct

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.970
connection to Earth that’s not dependent
on satellites.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.100
Odds are though that as the Moon develops
we’d see transmitter towers pop up on every

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.610
peak, particularly as you can’t really do
geosynchronous, or lunar synchronous satellites

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:09.480
for the Moon, and even if you tried you’d
be introducing an enormous signal lag. That’s

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.150
one way we might see crater villages pop up
too, you put up a tower for power and transmission

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.330
relay and a small settlement develops around
it.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:22.019
There’s no fossil fuels on the Moon and
no air to use to burn it, so electric power

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:27.270
for vehicles and robots is probably going
to be the big thing from Day 1, and while

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.399
batteries are always good as a reserve, I
suspect we’d see a lot of wireless microwave

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:36.510
power transmission incorporated into everything,
which means blanketing the surface with power

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.829
relays and that can be done incrementally
too.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:45.149
Now, back to those crater cities themselves.
First, I want to stress again that we are

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:50.050
looking at cities today, or at least large
settlements, this episode is not about initial

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:55.181
bases except as telling us where those bigger
settlements would likely originate from. Those

00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:59.529
initially tiny bases would logically tend
to be where a city arose from so we need to

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:03.839
consider initial base placement, and we looked
at early Bases more themselves in Moon Base

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:09.149
Concepts and Battle for the Moon.
To discuss those early settlements better,

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:12.940
we have to decide if the Moon’s gravity
by itself is enough for people to live comfortably

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.399
and healthily, and of course we don’t know
yet. We know it’s unhealthy to live in no

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:22.670
gravity but we don’t know if you need Earth-normal,
or close to it, or if even lower gravity than

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:28.220
the moon might be just fine. If it isn’t
though, we need simulated gravity in the settlement,

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.230
potentially spinning the entire thing around
inside that crater, but for today we will

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:37.000
assume that Moon gravity is good enough; or
that if not, people’s individual homes or

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.140
main workplaces could incorporate a small
rotating section.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.940
Those would be interesting rotating houses
or apartments, as your door would be in your

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.660
roof and you’d probably walk down your ceiling
to a floor that was basically a spinning cylinder

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.190
slight curved to be narrower at the bottom.
You wouldn’t have windows except maybe in

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.510
that ceiling and I suspect those would tend
to be tilted or wobble just a bit to keep

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:03.120
Earth in the same place with the night sky
seemingly whirling around it. It might be

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.860
rather nauseating to see that whirling around
several times a minute on the smaller ones.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.260
That’s an option, as is mega-sizing it to
include a whole crater, but we’ll instead

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.630
assume that folks can either live in Moon
gravity just fine all the time, or need some

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.500
minor medical assistance of some sort to do
so, or that years long deployments, with occasional

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.080
trips back to Earth or a rotating space station,
are adequate.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.491
That’s the easiest case and the one that
most favors major moon expansion. If you need

00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:34.889
to live under spin gravity most of the time,
then expansion around Earth-Moon space is

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:39.779
likely to be in Cylinder Habitats and not
on the Moon. The Moon is still industrially

00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:44.320
and scientifically attractive, thus encouraging
folks to live there, but I wouldn’t expect

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.320
major residential settlement. Alternatively
if you can live just fine in some personal

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.170
house or dome of your own, then it’s a lot
more attractive.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.690
Incidentally I doubt we’d ever see a ton
of classic single domes. It is possible to

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.500
flat out terraform the Moon complete with
oceans and air, though quite a pain, but while

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.350
it’s airless you view the world through
windows with rapid automatic shutters in case

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:12.149
of damage, not while sitting in t-shirt and
shorts under a big glass dome. I’m sure

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:16.740
that would happen, but more in the way folks
get a kick out of sitting on cliffs or a boat,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.440
for a bit of thrill, not to relax and soak
up the Sun. It’s just a lot safer to use

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.970
a mirror and a lens to bounce such light into
some nice garden and lawn you’ve got growing

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:31.470
in something akin to a bomb-proof bunker.
This is especially true if the gravity isn’t

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:36.050
enough for constant comfortable living and
so homes need to spin and thus might as well

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.940
be buried underground too anyway.
This doesn’t really give us the lush fertile

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:46.740
crater folks might be picturing though, but
a few caveats on that. First, a local culture

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.949
gets influenced and built around by what the
major advantages and disadvantages of the

00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:56.430
area are, and the ever present fear of a catastrophe
breach or puncture is going to be on their

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.769
minds no matter how safe you make things,
same as Hurricane fears are for folks on coasts,

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:06.800
or flooding for those on rivers, or earthquakes
for those on the Pacific Rim. Expect it to

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.430
influence every aspect of their life, subtly
or overtly. That might diminish with time

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:17.149
though, micro-meteors represent no true threat
to a dome and bigger ones are likely to be

00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:21.399
easily detected and vaporized by the sort
of infrastructure we’d expect in place if

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:26.860
the Moon was seriously colonized, but customs
and traditions and building regulations and

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.230
the architecture and lifestyles resulting
from them are likely to hang around long after

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.740
the need is gone.
Second, keeping that in mind, technology does

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:41.370
improve and especially where necessity drives
it. As we mentioned in spaceship design, folks

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:46.060
living in a spaceship have this same concern
and might address it by just having ultra-comfortable

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.880
spacesuits as default clothing, complete with
some self-inflating head-bulb that could trigger

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.100
if the pressure dropped, or some life-capsule
drone following them around who could expand

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.470
and swallow them if the dome ruptured and
they got blown out. Indeed it’s pretty probable

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.570
folks in the future, even just a few decades
from now, we’ll be used to being followed

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.639
around everywhere by some sort of drone or
a whole posse of them and the low lunar gravity

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:13.050
will make buoyancy and lift of such drones
easier.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.171
Third, technology improves, and we just won’t
have a bunch of Crater Cities on the Moon

00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:22.620
this century, regardless of technology. Communities
don’t just emerge and grow that rapidly,

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.630
even if we got the tech and infrastructure
to do this all tomorrow it would still be

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.019
generations before there were a bunch of major
settlements on the Moon. That’s a lot of

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:35.860
time for other technologies to develop and
grow mundane and routine, like minor cybernetic

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.590
augmentations that let folks wander around
a vacuum conscious and somewhat safe for a

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.160
few minutes. Or have clothing that was literally
made of a bunch of microscopic robots that

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.510
just swarmed into whatever shapes you needed
them to be, be it a spacesuit or a simple

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:54.670
tool. I’d also not be surprised if a lot
of folks just had themselves rebuilt so they

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:59.460
could just live in an unpressurized hut and
stroll outside onto the airless low gravity

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.139
surface entirely casually or at least virtually
through advanced telepresence.

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:08.711
Fourth, just because homes and workplaces
and other places where folks spent most of

00:15:08.711 --> 00:15:13.069
their time might tend to be carved into a
rim-wall like some cave or bunker, doesn’t

00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:17.639
mean the crater would be lifeless. Whether
it’s a big dome or a bunch of small ones

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:23.160
connected together, that’s perfectly fine
for crops and parks. Especially for farmland,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.730
where most of the farming is probably largely
automated anyway, a catastrophic puncture

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:32.459
just means the loss of one plot of land and
the organics inside it. Not a good thing but

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:37.860
not some horrible headline reading dome punctured,
a dozen children sucked into the void.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:43.019
I would bet most craters would get terraformed
and have a big lake at the bottom, many having

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:47.940
a center island around the peak that often
juts from the center of craters. This isn’t

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.560
just to be pretty either, you’re very likely
to be setting up your solar thermal power

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.850
generation to initially take advantage of
that cold crater bottom as one end of your

00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.500
heat reservoir for a heat engine to produce
power, and as that expands or if you’re

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.120
using nuclear power instead, it’s nice to
have a giant puddle of water to use as a cooling

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.449
pond, and you could keep that evaporating
and raining on the crater wall in a smaller

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:15.000
single dome crater or pump the moisture around
to the other tiers of the crater domes. The

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.980
center of the crater would also receive more
radiation than the rim areas which are shadowed

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.660
by the crater walls themselves.
Then you’d probably have many-tiered and

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.760
individually domed levels, with doors and
windows in them leading into homes and workplaces.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.820
This would probably sprawl out onto the exterior
of rim walls and onto plains, though likely

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.500
in growing crater sprawls as many of them
touch or even combine. More like an upside-down

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.630
city, with a foam of domes at “street-level”
and the buildings underground.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:47.709
Indeed, while there are a lot of big craters
on the Moon, as mentioned earlier most are

00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:52.029
smaller, often craters inside craters, and
a lot of these probably would be a single

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:56.910
dome. You might dome a crater inside a crater
or near your main crater and turn it into

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.440
a stadium, for instance. Playing any ball
games there is likely to be interesting though

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.970
considering how long a ball, be it a baseball
or soccer ball or volleyball, is going to

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:11.319
spend in the air before landing. That might
require some rather large stadiums as a result.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:15.720
I’d also not be surprised if a vacuum-version
developed a lot, there’s nothing really

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.750
stopping you from playing baseball in spacesuits
for instance.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.789
Ultimately though I think we’d still see
those major habitats really being built into

00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:29.220
the crater walls, not down at their bottom
or on their skin, but safely burrowed inside.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.480
It’s just easier to have a mirror array
concentrate light and send it down a shaft

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.440
that can automatically seal if punctured to
be spread out and bounced around inside some

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.500
places safely tucked away under meters of
sturdy rock, with large gardens and farms

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.280
inside and out.
Those would be rather beautiful gems for folks

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.940
to look at from rim-wall and nearby orbital
facilities, but on the Earth-side of the Moon

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.240
at least, you’d always be able to see Earth
right there anyway, so we might see more of

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.140
this sort of crater parks and farm on the
Far or Dark side of the Moon.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:07.840
Of course, these might serve as the seeds
to eventually terraforming the Moon, but that’s

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.110
a topic for another day.
A bit of a recurring theme we have for space

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:15.059
colonization is that it will be very skill
intensive, and in our increasingly knowledge

00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:19.030
and skill-based future, it’s going to be
quite a challenge to ensure small groups of

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.900
explorers or colonists have rapid access to
all the information they need and in a format

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:29.100
they can absorb most easily and quickly. Of
course that’s a problem we have nowadays

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.620
down here on Earth too, and is where online
videos and classes like those offered by Skillshare

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.230
can be invaluable.
Skillshare offers thousands of inspiring classes

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:44.620
for creative and curious people, on topics
including illustration, design, photography,

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:51.809
video, freelancing, and more. Running a graphics-intensive
show like SFIA, and being trained as a physicist

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:56.590
not a graphic designer, I’ve found their
graphic design courses, like Aaron Draplin’s

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.580
“21 Tips for Speeding Up Your Design Workflow”,
to be incredibly helpful in improving my own

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:07.580
work, and Skillshare has classes to fit your
schedule and skill level on many helpful topics.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.870
A premium membership is less than $10 a month
and gives you access to that course and all

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:18.580
the rest, and you can try it out for free.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.419
So next week we’ll head back deep into the
far future to look at the end of the Universe,

00:19:35.419 --> 00:19:40.270
the Heat Death, and ways we might postpone
that. And in two weeks we’ll look at ways

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:45.400
we might avoid potential catastrophes nearer
home in time and space, as we discuss Climate

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:51.020
Change Mitigation techniques for natural or
artificial calamities, be it volcanoes, asteroids,

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.100
or carbon dioxide.
But before then we have a bonus episode coming

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.220
up this weekend, where we’ll explore how
we might coexist with artificial intelligence.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.700
