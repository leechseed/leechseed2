00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.839
Neil Armstrong described setting foot on the
Moon as one small step for a man, one giant

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.580
leap for mankind.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.230
The National Space Society tells us that returning
to the Moon in a big way will accomplish 4

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.000
of 31 critical steps toward interplanetary
settlement.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.580
So today we are continuing our look at becoming
an interplanetary species.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.440
In parts one and two we took a look the first
steps, getting into orbit and colonizing Cislunar

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.530
space and our Lagrange Points, and today we’ll
be continuing our development as we look at

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.460
getting a base on the Moon and growing that
into a permanent facility to serve as our

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.290
stepping stone to other planets.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.440
As before, we’ll be using the National Space
Society’s Roadmap to Space Settlement as

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.730
a loose guide, and I’ve linked the complete
document in the episode description.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.080
The NSS considers part 3 to be a return to
the Moon, and the milestones for that will

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.380
be our focus today, though we’ll not hold
to it rigidly.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.540
Also the Moon is a topic I try to hit about
once a year.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.560
The principal episodes for that in order of
production are Moon Base Concepts, Industrializing

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.740
the Moon, Battle for the Moon, and Moon: Crater
Cities, and while we could easily do a dozen

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.670
episodes just on the Moon without denting
the material to discuss, some parts of today’s

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.680
topic we’ve looked at before in greater
depth in those episodes, so I’ll mention

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.930
and link those episodes as we go if you want
to dive in a bit deeper.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.800
Now last time we talked about how we needed
the Moon as a resource source for developing

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.801
Cislunar Space and launching out beyond the
Earth-Moon region to places like Mars and

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.900
the Asteroid Belt, our main topics for episodes
4 and 5.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.650
However, setting up the moon as some sort
of massive mine and manufactory is not something

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.009
we’ll do overnight and will have a lot of
intermediary steps.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.819
Though I suppose one could argue we’ve already
mined the Moon, as collecting rock samples

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.769
was a primary mission for the Apollo Project.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.370
This however is our first Milestone in Part
3, Milestone 18, Robotic Confirmation of Lunar

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.370
Resources.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.810
Sending folks to the Moon is dangerous and
expensive.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.620
It’s frankly amazing that so few lives have
been lost during Space Exploration and a testament

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.379
to the skill of engineers and mission planners
and operators, not to mention the sheer willpower

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.560
and courage of the astronauts.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.819
We should not forget though that we lost the
Apollo 1 crew and nearly lost Apollo 13.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.830
Given that we have only had 12 men on the
moon and lost 3 and nearly lost 3 more, that’s

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.109
not a ratio that encourages us to try more
manned missions, even with decades more technological

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.849
development, when a robot can do a given mission
easier, cheaper and safer and in some ways

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.150
better.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.459
Before we can develop a permanent base on
the moon we need to know where the resources

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.030
are because unless launch costs drop massively
– as they might, see the Upward Bound series

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.540
for some of the options – then we can only
do such a base with either a very meager level

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.580
of resources or by sourcing a lot of them
on site, what is called “in-situ”, and

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.879
ISRU, In-Situ Resource Utilization.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.680
Creating a rover that masses maybe a hundred
kilograms and has wheels, a remote, a battery,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.459
some solar panels, a spectrometer and some
sample containers and some sort of excavating

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.140
apparatus is obviously well within our current
capabilities, and the Moon is close enough

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.379
for effectively real-time remote control of
the rover.

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.260
It would be relatively easy, compared to a
manned mission, to drop dozens or even hundreds

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.459
of such drones down on the Moon to collect
data and poke about for things like water

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.909
ice or mineral deposits.

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.489
Of course this is after we’ve refined and
validated our designs currently in development[a].

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.379
The low gravity of the Moon combined with
the talcum powder-like surface makes getting

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.209
enough traction for digging[b] difficult [c]and
the larger deposits we're looking for may

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.480
be below the surface and, beneath that top
layer of fine, dusty regolith, lunar soil

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.700
gets compacted and hard.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.639
Another thing to consider is that if we intend
to set up large refining and processing centers

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.150
we need to find areas with large and varied
deposits.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.110
Much of the ore extraction[d] and refining
processing is complemented by other materials

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.430
and byproducts.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.401
Where one type of ore may yield materials
not necessarily profitable for export, but

00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:30.770
useful for the processing of other ores or
useful in alloying or compounding into other

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.350
materials for local use or export.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.630
The more varied the inputs, the more varied
and valuable your products.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.790
But detailed, on the ground surveying of the
Moon isn’t just for finding a few good spots

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.120
for initial bases.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.780
It is easy to forget that the moon is covered
in craters and at the bottoms of those craters

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.910
are meteorites.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.170
Since the moon lacks all the biological, hydrological,
and geological processes of Earth that remove

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.720
craters, the semi-intact objects that impacted
there and caused them are basically still

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720
there.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.300
If you get good at surveying such craters
you would be able to spot which ones were

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.820
made by what kind of rocks and might find
some very valuable metals and minerals in

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.820
them.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.640
For instance Carbonaceous chondrites, while
a relatively rare type of meteorite on Earth

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.860
as few make it through our atmosphere, don’t
contain many scarce or valuable elements on

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.230
Earth - but they’d be more common on the
Moon and their carbon and organic compounds,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.570
containing volatiles, amino acids and rarer
light elements, would be prized.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.790
But we won’t limit our exploration to just
the surface, lava tube skylights allow access

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.350
to vast sub-surface[e] spaces.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.490
Lava tube spelunking probe designs are being
evaluated to explore these hidden interiors.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.420
These designs consist of a rover which carries
the probe to the skylight and lowers[f] it

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.470
with a tether.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.370
The probe then rapells down into the tube
where it then becomes a simpler rover.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.820
The tether either stays attached to the probe,
acting as an umbilical for power and data,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.290
or detaches and becomes an antenna for communicating
with the now self-powered probe.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.140
However, we may want to go a step further,
as our technology has improved a lot in robotics

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.990
and does more every day.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.630
Indeed, this recent health crisis has had
the silver lining of accelerating both our

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.030
capability and usage of remote work, and doubtless
we will be seeing major improvements in those

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.220
technologies in years to come as more and
more folks opt to work remotely and the tools

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.480
for doing so expand.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.481
In a sense, at the timescales of space exploration
projects, robotic telepresence for exploring

00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:28.250
the moon is not that far off.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.060
Necessity is the mother of invention and that’s
a thing to remember for space exploration

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.050
too, there’s a good chance we will encounter
both problems we did not expect out there

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.140
and find solutions for those, and adaptations
of them useful for back at home, that we just

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.640
can not see right now.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.820
But we are still in early days so our options
are limited.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.910
However, not too limited.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.990
For instance, it is just as easy, if not easier,
to make a rover that just has a scoop or dozer

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.030
blade on it as opposed to mineral surveying
gear, and have one shove regolith into a heap

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.030
or mound.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.920
It is also not hard to include a solar kiln
that can bake oxygen out of regolith.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.360
The Moon’s regolith is mostly oxygen by
mass, tied up in minerals with elements like

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.730
Silicon, Iron, Calcium, and Aluminum in that
order.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.700
If you have a solar kiln extracting those
elements, then oxygen is actually a waste

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.740
product.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.230
We do want those other elements too, as we
looked at in our last episode, getting megatons

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.330
of iron and aluminum off the Moon is critical
to developing Cislunar space as the fuel bill

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.210
for moving raw materials from the moon to
Low Earth Orbit is orders of magnitude cheaper

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.720
than from Earth’s surface, even though it
means moving those resources a thousand times

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.720
further.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.540
Regardless, it is not beyond our technical
capability even now to make a remote-controlled

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.220
production chain that would involve rovers
scooping regolith into solar kilns to produce

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.020
the refined metal as bricks, sheets, rods,
or thin foils.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.340
There’s likely to be lots of minor practical
issues in adapting anything made on Earth

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.690
to work on the Moon, but a first wave of soil
and resource surveyors would probably make

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.710
that adaptation much easier as we learn what
works in practice and what doesn’t.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.750
Now our losses in the space programs are generally
not from day to day operations, on space or

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.850
on the moon, but the launch and transit phases.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.250
Nonetheless a robotic presence that had either
constructed an initial habitation module or

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.560
provided most of the bulky raw materials for
assembly not only helps cut down on the risk

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.030
to astronauts once they land, but gives us
a lot more mass to add extra safety features

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.950
and redundancy or thickness of shielding to
the vehicles going there.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:36.909
In an ideal scenario, when we get to Milestone
19, our Lunar Research and Development Facility,

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.339
that first outpost will already be pretty
well supplied.

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:43.969
Gravity is low on the Moon which means you
can pile a lot of regolith on top of something

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:48.100
like a thin sheet of metal supported by some
metal tubes to make essentially a large and

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.819
very sturdy tent.

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:54.240
Similarly, we can fly in some supplies and
equipment before the astronauts even arrive,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.199
dropping packages of food, batteries, spare
fuel or air or water and so forth for the

00:08:59.199 --> 00:09:02.260
drones to stack into cover in such a tent.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.750
We can also have them clear and mat down a
landing pad free of lunar dust, so that when

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.529
astronauts arrive, they essentially just have
to get out and do some assembly of whatever

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:15.290
was beyond the robots’ abilities, and from
cargo that arrived in quantity before they

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.820
did.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.810
Robots will need to play a big role in developing
the moon, fundamentally because our key long

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.399
term interest in the place is to turn it into
a mass manufacturing facility of fuel and

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:29.899
construction material that relies heavily
on automation, especially handy if we opt

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:35.240
for using nuclear power to run things, but
for now let’s turn our eyes to that first

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240
manned outpost.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.889
First off, location matters.

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:43.199
We already know the preferred spot in a general
sense, and that is near the poles.

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:48.040
The Moon has a day that is a month long, making
solar power difficult and part of why atomic

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.889
power sources – both reactors and radioisotope
thermal generators or RTGS are attractive.

00:09:53.889 --> 00:09:57.630
Fortunately near the poles this is less of
an issue as we can take advantage of various

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.630
high-walled craters and the latitude to get
spots where the Sun shines most of the time.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.990
Those same craters, down near their bottoms,
will tend to have very cold spots which might

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.639
be heavy in some valuable materials.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:13.269
This is why those robot surveyors would be
handy since they can poke around and find

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:16.470
which if any crater is high in something like
water ice.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.620
We discussed this more back in the spring
in our episode Crater Cities.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.410
Of course, lava tubes are also prime candidates
for lunar cities or bases, and may contain

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.110
ice deposits inside their permanently shadowed
interiors too - and they have inherent shielding

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.870
and meteorite protection.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.619
But what sort of research are we going to
do here in this first outpost?

00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:39.009
One of the most tempting is radio astronomy.

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:43.389
There is no Dark Side of the Moon in the sense
of sunless eternal night, except down in some

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:48.499
of those crater bottoms, but there is a side
that is Dark to the Earth, and all of Earth’s

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:49.499
noise.

00:10:49.499 --> 00:10:53.290
There are also other science projects or Lunar
Development projects better done in spots

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.279
not on the poles and we also have a lot of
interest in the Moon’s enormous lava tubes.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:02.699
So while that first base is likely to be mostly
about R&amp;D for using and colonizing the moon,

00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:07.009
it strikes me as very likely that it would
not develop further as a science outpost so

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:10.460
much as a support hub for many smaller outposts.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.150
As an example, if we have air and metal production
being done at one site, it’s very easy to

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.970
bring that air into some smaller facility
of a few researchers who just have a cache

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.819
of supplies and a modest amount of solar panels
and RTGs to power the place.

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:27.050
Atomic power sources are very attractive on
the Moon incidentally.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.990
There is uranium there, plus uranium is also
very light in terms of its energy density,

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.070
compared to chemical fuels, if you needed
to bring it in from Earth.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.529
And you don’t really need to worry about
meltdowns wrecking an area, the Moon is already

00:11:39.529 --> 00:11:42.019
a radiation-scoured desert.

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:45.269
Such being the case it is a great place to
be setting up breeder reactors like those

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:48.269
we discussed in the Future of Fission a couple
weeks back.

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:54.019
It’s a very attractive place to do Nuclear
Research and what’s more, producing Plutonium-238,

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:58.819
which emits about 500 watts per kilogram and
has a half life of 88 years is a potential

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:04.160
boom market for a lot of space enterprises
since it offers a reliable and small power

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.160
supply.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.959
Ditto Strontium-90, which is easier to produce
and has about the same power density but is

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:11.721
shorter lived and needs more shielding.

00:12:11.721 --> 00:12:17.300
Shielding is obviously not an issue for stationary
objects on the Moon but adds extra mass to

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.689
moving vehicles and spacecraft.

00:12:19.689 --> 00:12:23.790
Regardless, that first research outpost is
likely to be mostly about researching the

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:28.689
Moon and how to exist there, satellite and
smaller outpost focused on various research

00:12:28.689 --> 00:12:32.410
projects may pop up but that place is the
one likely to be where we are shipping stuff

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:37.709
to and trying out ideas like Lunar Hydroponics
and Domes or extracting water and metals or

00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:43.430
synthesizing fuels, and from this we would
expect our first continuously occupied Multi-purpose

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.110
Lunar Base to coalesce, Milestone 20.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.850
Its non-commercial applications of R&amp;D aside,
we can expect to see some commercial uses

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.259
popping up.

00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:58.040
As an example, if we place it near a source
of volatiles – things like nitrogen, water,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.190
carbon dioxide and so forth that we think
we might find in some of those craters for

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.250
instance – then we have a source of organic
elements for use not only on the Moon but

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.660
on those Cislunar space stations and habitats
we discussed last time, rather than having

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.540
to get them off the Earth or bring them in
from beyond the Frost Line from the Asteroid

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.389
Belt or Moons of gas giants.

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:18.560
There are some hurdles to this of course.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.380
We do not know if those volatiles exist on
the Moon yet and that’s why we need those

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.850
robot surveyors.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.350
I also mentioned earlier that it would be
nice if our robot could pre-build a base and

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:33.259
mentioned having them make a nice clean launch
pad for ships to land on, and Moon dust is

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:34.639
a real worry.

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:38.730
The dust is sticky and abrasive and drove
our astronauts to distraction.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.619
It can damage equipment, and given how sharp
the particles are, may be very bad to be breathing

00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:48.019
or touching for extended periods, and is often
considered one of the biggest hurdles and

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:50.990
headaches of lunar exploration and development.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.980
On the upside, the moon is basically a big
sandbox so it’s easy to maneuver the stuff

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.879
to form shielding against radiation and meteors.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:02.149
And due to the low gravity it doesn’t require
a lot of structure to hold up even meters-thick

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:03.149
shielding.

00:14:03.149 --> 00:14:06.529
That dust is part of the reason why solar
power isn’t considered the greatest solution

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:07.670
on the Moon.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.660
Besides it getting dark for a couple weeks
at a time, your solar panels or mirrors might

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.300
get coated in dust in short order, stirred
up by your own activity, and while you could

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.610
have a robot or person go out and sweep them
and then polish them when they get scratched,

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.149
it is another reason why nuclear is fairly
attractive on the Moon.

00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:28.220
We also talked about some other approaches
to solar power like Thermal Wadis in the Crater

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.230
City Episode.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.589
Another problem with this multi-purpose base
is also its big advantage.

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:38.999
Having many different functions gives it some
diversity for funding and operation but also

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:43.670
could cause funding and turf conflicts between
various divergent space goals and the government

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.639
branches or companies funding or operating
them.

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:51.350
This is probably even more the case if it’s
a multi-government international project,

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.560
and interestingly I would not be surprised
if the first moon base was actually a commercial

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.410
enterprise that various governments, companies,
or institutions rented facilities and time

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.629
at.

00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:05.589
One silver lining of bureaucratic battles
over space and funding is that it might also

00:15:05.589 --> 00:15:08.620
encourage separate satellite facilities to
form too.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.589
We discussed such issues more in Battle for
the Moon.

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:16.240
It should also be noted that just because
the poles and craters interest us, we don’t

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.709
necessarily put our first base inside one.

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:22.939
If your main interest in them is the rim walls
for solar power and the crater bottoms for

00:15:22.939 --> 00:15:27.519
volatiles, you might just opt to go mostly
nuclear instead of dragging solar panels from

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:32.360
home and operating them around the space dust
issue, and just sending out rovers and collection

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.179
teams, human or robotic, to collect volatiles
and bring them home.

00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:41.199
After all, Aristarchus Crater[g] and Plateau,
in the northwest of the Moon’s nearside,

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:46.029
is also considered a very attractive site
for its geological (or selenological) features

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:49.810
and may reveal more about the Moon itself
and the treasures it may offer than other

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:50.810
locations.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.639
In any event, after this base has been in
continuous use for a decade or so and hopefully

00:15:55.639 --> 00:16:00.649
grown and prospered, this is where we come
to finally having reached Milestone 21, a

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:02.779
Permanent Lunar Settlement.

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:06.439
Here we might see people actually living on
the Moon – maybe even born there – and

00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:10.939
we have to start tackling issues like building
schools and community spaces.

00:16:10.939 --> 00:16:16.959
You get your first hospital on the Moon, your
first daycare center, first park or garden,

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:21.600
first lunar hotel, first bar, first restaurant,
the first Church of the Moon, the first low-gravity

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.029
basketball court and so on.

00:16:24.029 --> 00:16:27.999
For that to be practical we need to be able
to get most resources, at least by weight,

00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:32.889
right there on the Moon, but that’s a double
necessity anyway since all those things implied

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:37.819
jobs and livelihoods beyond simple research
installations and resource production for

00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:42.540
Cislunar Space, as we looked at last time,
is essentially what is likely to drive Lunar

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.110
Development.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.610
After you have gotten all the science done
there – which admittedly could be an ongoing

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:52.470
project of thousands of researchers for centuries
– you have to have a reason for development

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.630
and that’s as a supply hub.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:59.739
The mass extraction and fabrication of solar
panels, shades, and mirrors may be one industrial

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:00.739
focus.

00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:04.890
Another might be fuel production for moving
around cislunar space and station keeping.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.470
Another might be huge amounts of metal plates
for building space stations and habitats.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.039
Exporting volatiles is another, but will depend
a lot on the supply and availability of them

00:17:14.039 --> 00:17:15.600
and we really don’t know yet.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.840
That’s one hurdle we still need to overcome,
same we don’t really know if there are good

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.059
concentrations of ores.

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:26.620
We know we’ll have no shortage of aluminum
and iron and silicon of course, but not necessarily

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.570
other useful metals in a way that will be
easier than getting them off Earth, for all

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:35.500
the launch cost issues, or from the Asteroid
Belt a bit down the road.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.549
And by the time we have staged up to this
level of production and occupation, we probably

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:43.100
have gone on to both the Asteroid Belt and
Mars.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.289
We also do not know how humans will handle
living on the Moon.

00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:50.340
There is gravity there and it might be enough
to stay healthy without significant treatment,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.220
but there are many medical and psychological
unknowns still.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.960
It is possible people won’t handle living
on the Moon for extended periods very well

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:03.200
and we might have to have more frequent personnel
rotations or go a lot more robotic, which

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.250
might hamper many projects.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.690
Once you have this first big permanent base
though, or while you’re building it, hopefully

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.350
you will have picked the ideal power source
for the Moon, got it going big, and be running

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.010
all that production.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:20.309
That might include fuel of course, even if
it is short on volatiles Aluminum and Oxygen

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:24.720
can be used as a rocket fuel, and you might
also build a mass driver or electromagnetic

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.790
coil gun for launching things into space.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:32.470
The escape velocity from the Moon is just
over 2 kilometers a second, there’s no air

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.649
for friction there, so such a catapult doesn’t
need its payload to ascend above the atmosphere

00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:40.720
like it would on Earth, since there ain’t
one, so it might be the preferred way of shooting

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.830
stuff into Cislunar space.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:47.740
Or on to Mars and the Asteroid Belt, our next
two episodes, and as we’ll see there, the

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.500
ability to robotically explore those places
and pre-deliver large amounts of goods before

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.040
humans arrive, potentially launched from the
Moon and for some of it, manufactured on the

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.140
Moon too, could be a massive boon.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.710
Getting to Mars will be no easy thing, but
in truth if you have a solid base and production

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:09.970
setup on the Moon, with or without the accompanying
Cislunar development, that task becomes an

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.759
order of magnitude easier while at the same
time you’ve already solved a lot of the

00:19:13.759 --> 00:19:15.720
problems a trip to Mars will include.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.380
There’s always some debate if we should
go to Mars first or back to the Moon again,

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.940
like most of you I would be happy either way
and I do believe it is possible to go to Mars

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.700
without this stop at the Moon, but it strikes
me as far harder and more risky.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.330
The Moon is close, close enough for real-time
conversation with earth and only a few days

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.750
away by conventional rockets if we need to
get them help or evacuate.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.399
We would hopefully be able to rescue people
from other bases on the Moon but if it came

00:19:42.399 --> 00:19:46.559
down to it, one lone astronaut with a spare
air tank could potentially survive for the

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:51.010
few days needed to scramble a rescue mission
right from Earth orbital facilities if need

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.230
be, while experts at home can advise real
time on what they should do to survive.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:20:00.179
That won’t be an option for Mars, so it
is best to work out a lot of the kinks on

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:02.970
the Moon before trying our hand there.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.150
Those same long travel times and hardships
also encourage us to want to start from day

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:12.960
one on Mars with a permanent base, not a small
expedition to land, plant a flag, and get

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.100
some rock samples.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:22.970
And as we’ll see next time, setting up a
base on Mars will be no easy task.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.809
So this was the third episode of the series
and we bumped it up earlier in our schedule

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:29.480
because of demand from the audience not to
wait.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.280
If you didn’t know though, it actually came
out a few days earlier over on Nebula, our

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.919
new streaming service, and all of our episodes
come out there now a bit early and ad-free.

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:43.340
If you’d like to catch all of SFIAs episodes
early and without ads, or see any of the great

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.040
content from our sister channels on Nebula,
you can sign up for Nebula today.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.030
However, you can also get it for free by instead
signing up for Curiosity Stream, whose partnering

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.580
with us to bring you the best education videos
out there.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.370
Curiosity Stream has excellent educational
content of their own and they are running

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.990
26% discount if you use the link in the description.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.539
That’s a great deal since it means you get
a year of both Curiositystream and Nebula

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:12.490
for less than $15, and it helps support this
show and a lot of other educational content

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:17.000
which is what Curiositystream and Nebula are
all about, and again you can get a year of

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.679
both for less than $15 by using the link in
the episode’s description.

00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:25.950
So as mentioned we are continuing our look
at Becoming an Interplanetary Species, and

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:30.220
in three weeks that will take us to Mars and
our first colony there.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.510
Next week though we’ll be a bit closer to
home as we contemplate the notion of Mega-Cities,

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:39.269
the popular and often dystopian concept in
science fiction, and we’ll look at the challenges

00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:42.370
and interesting scenarios for cities on the
grow.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:47.450
Then on Sunday October 11th we’ll be taking
a look at the recent Navy UFO videos and analyzing

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:53.019
those, and in two weeks we’ll be contemplating
the notion of a Low-Tech Spacefaring culture.

00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:57.400
If you want alerts when those and other episodes
come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.720

other futuristic ideas.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.840
Until next time, thanks for watching, and
have a great week!
