00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.249
Gonna go for landing
Retro go

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:07.439
Control go
Surgeon go

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.680
We copy you down, Eagle.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.860
Houston, Tranquility Base here.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.390
THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.570
In previous videos we’ve already leapt way
past the moon to discuss terraforming planets,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.800
colonizing other solar systems, and buildings
artificial worlds.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.030
We sort of skipped the moon because I tend
to think of it as having been covered a lot

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.580
elsewhere but in truth nobody really goes
into much detail about what we’d do with

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.070
the moon after getting a base there.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.480
Generally it is get there, set up base, use
base for getting to Mars somehow, and mine

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.480
it somehow.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.470
We don’t tend to see much actual discussion
of this base and what it does.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.630
Or how it advances the general purpose of
getting out into space or moves forward itself.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.710
I thought today we’d delve into that matter
a bit more and explore some of the options

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.690
and ideas.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.320
Before we go any further, if this is the first
video on the channel you’ve seen then there’s

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.300
two features you should be aware of.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.050
First, since I have a speech impediment the
videos always include a transcript and closed

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.070
caption subtitles you can turn on, some people
have a harder time understanding me and that’s

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.250
not even including all the arcane technical
jargon these videos often have to include.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.800
Second, for the sake of brevity I occasionally
reference other videos on this channel or

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.590
other ones where a concept got discussed in
more detail rather than repeating myself and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.110
if you see a thumbnail or video clip pop up
in a yellow or white link box you can click

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.900
on that and it will just pause this video
and open that one up in a new window so you

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.070
can watch that and return here where you left
off.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.310
Okay, so people often wonder why we haven’t
gone back to the moon since the 70s.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.590
We did it six times successfully in a few
years nearly half a century ago and neither

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.590
the United States nor anyone else has gone
there since, at least with people.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.080
In the meantime we have vastly improved a
lot of the relevant technology, especially

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.390
computers and robotics which is part of the
reason.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.870
Our rockets are better, are quality controls
are better, and we can make vastly lighter

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.650
or superior equipment to what we had in the
late sixties.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.050
Fact of the matter is the US could easily
do another series of moon landings and Congress

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.280
is hardly afraid to cough up the cash for
that since the taxpayers would mostly not

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.150
object to the expense.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.420
The European Union, Russia, China, Japan,
or frankly just about any G20 nation has the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.500
necessary technology and infrastructure to
do it.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.960
So why hasn’t anyone?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.599
Of course some people doubt we ever went there
in the first place, that it was all fake,

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.480
and in these modern days of photoshop and
CGI it’s hard to dissuade them.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.860
I’ve occasionally heard people suggest you
could see the Apollo Landing sites through

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.850
a telescope but that’s not true, even the
Hubble telescope lacks the resolution to view

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.330
the moon and even if it did I wouldn’t think
that would convince anyone since someone could

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.830
mess with the video feed.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.310
We can resolve human sized objects on Earth
from space, but the moon is about a thousand

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.120
times further away from us than those satellites
are.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.910
You can’t see any man made objects on the
moon through any telescope we have now let

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.390
alone one available commercially.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.370
So a lot of people subscribe to the Moon Hoax
theory I think mostly because they just can’t

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.890
imagine why we haven’t gone back since and
no one else has either.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.750
But the simple reality is that as things currently
stand there’s not much real benefit to gain

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.120
from doing so.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.760
Getting some more moon rocks or drilling some
samples would certainly be nice but it’s

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.220
not a particularly urgent project at the cost,
there’s lots of other science of higher

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.069
priority that can be done cheaper, and if
we did do it we’d end up using robots which

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.030
would defeat the purpose.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.569
We want to stick people on the moon again
And collecting samples is honestly just an

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.500
excuse to do that.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.440
So when someone inevitably points out a robot
can do it better and cheaper we end up sending

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.209
neither man nor machine because we don’t
really need more moon rocks.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.440
I would suspect that given a long enough time,
even without any more technological improvements,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.760
someone will get around to going there again
but for it to be more than an exercise in

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.629
national inspiration you have to have some
real purpose in going there and with people,

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:12.690
not robots.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.069
Part of the reason manned missions to Mars
are so appealing, besides being a step forward

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.839
rather than a repetition of past glory, is
that the time lag to Mars is many minutes

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:26.020
as opposed to the Moon which is only a couple
seconds.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.499
So robots can be controlled more or less in
real time on the moon.

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.270
No thinking human brain actually needs to
be on the moon overseeing the affair or doing

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.270
the work.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.189
To push forward with the moon we need a genuinely
valid reason to want to not just send people

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:45.780
to the Moon, actual people not robots, we
need a reason to justify a permanent presence

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.780
there.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.759
So let’s consider what the moon has that
Earth doesn’t… and unfortunately it’s

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.710
not a terribly long list.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.990
First it lacks two things which Earth does
have, an atmosphere and a gravity well.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.810
Gravity is a real downside to space travel
and the moon has much less of that, and the

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.199
same is true of atmospheres.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.279
What it does have that the Earth lacks is
Helium-3.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:15.930
There’s just not much on Earth, truth be
told there’s not much on the Moon either

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.939
but it looks like there’s way more than
we have here.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:24.169
This relative abundance of Helium-3 has sparked
a lot of talk about mining the moon for it,

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.360
to be used in nuclear fusion.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.430
There was great film, especially considering
its low budget, called Moon back in 2009 in

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.050
which such an operation was going on and of
course tons of articles in various pop sci

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.939
publications in recent years.

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:44.719
Problem being we don’t have any nuclear
fusion reactors to use it for fuel in.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:50.090
We discussed the impact of nuclear fusion
last year and its huge, just a few kilograms

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.430
of fusion fuel would produce around a billion
kilo-watt-hours of juice, a hundred million

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.919
bucks worth of power, and yeah its expensive
to get to the moon and back but not that expensive,

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.699
especially if you’re setting up shop and
just shooting cargo back.

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.300
Moon return trips are relatively cheap since
there isn’t much air or gravity to keep

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.229
you from getting off the moon and plenty of
gravity to help you get back to Earth and

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.089
air to slow you down on re-entry.

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:19.689
So helium-3 mining is definitely a good reason
to go back to the moon and stay there, you’d

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:25.149
only need to return 10 or 20 tons of the material
a year to run the US power grid.

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:30.629
Again though, we don’t have a fusion reactor,
and none of our main efforts to get fusion

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:31.629
use Helium-3.

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:36.910
They use deuterium and tritium, two hydrogen
isotopes, because one of the hard parts about

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.809
fusion is overcoming the Coulomb Barrier,
the repulsive force between two positively

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:43.660
charged atomic nuclei.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:50.009
Simply put, helium-3 consists of two protons
and a neutron, whereas tritium is one proton

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.159
and two neutrons and deuterium is one proton
and neutron.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.189
Pushing a pair of protons together is hard,
like repels like, and Helium-3 has twice as

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:03.339
many protons as deuterium and tritium so it’s
much harder.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:07.789
In basic terms the temperature you need to
pull off inside your reactor is about ten

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.819
times hotter if you want to use Helium-3.

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:15.560
Now a helium-3 and deuterium reaction is a
great power source but again it’s a much

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.219
harder one to pull off then Deuterium-Tritium
and both of those are relatively abundant

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.629
on Earth and fusion is fusion.

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:26.770
You get any working fusion reactor and you
totally change the world.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.899
The advantage of helium-3 compared to them
is mostly that it’s an aneutronic type of

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:36.439
fusion and that has a lot of potential advantages
especially for making a compact reactor that

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:40.490
didn’t take up whole city blocks and might
conceivably fit into a spaceship that didn’t

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.289
dwarf an aircraft carrier.

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:47.240
I mentioned in that video on fusion that as
great as fusion would be it isn’t necessarily

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.749
usable directly for spaceships since size
and power output per mass of the reactor is

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:55.499
very important for that application.

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:59.849
We discussed a lot of alternatives for launch
if you have a lot of power but it’s bulky,

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:05.520
like mass drivers and launch loops, but helium-3
reactions and aneutronic fusion reactors hold

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.970
a better promise of being able to actually
cram a fusion reactor into a spaceship as

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.629
a useful power source than deuterium-tritium
reactions.

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:19.509
But even then, you also don’t necessarily
need the moon as a Helium-3 source for spaceships

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:20.729
leaving Earth.

00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:26.759
We focus on Deuterium-Tritium because it’s
an easier reaction than anything else to produce.

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:31.499
But your ideal fusion reactor, besides one
that runs on straight vanilla hydrogen, is

00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:37.870
a deuterium-deuterium reactor, because deuterium
is very plentiful on Earth and all over the

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:38.900
Universe.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.620
Deuterium-Deuterium requires higher temperatures
than Deuterium-Tritium but not as much as

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:48.910
Helium-3, and a Deuterium reactor produces
tritium and helium-3 as its byproducts.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.140
If you want helium-3 you can just extract
is from the reactor, and for that matter any

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.580
leftover tritium will decay into Helium-3
too.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.960
That’s where we get out supply of Helium-3,
we use Tritium to boost Fusion Bomb yields

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.250
and with a half-life of only a dozen years
we have to suck out helium-3 and replace it

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.820
with new Tritium.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.110
Though I should note that Helium-3, even if
you can’t use it for fusion fuel, is still

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.240
useful stuff.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:19.180
Helium-3 is used for quite a few applications,
these days it costs several thousand dollars

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.020
a gram, hundreds of times more than gold,
so at current market prices a ton of it shipped

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.530
home from the Moon would fetch several billion
dollars.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:33.100
Of course you’d expect the price to drop
sharply if quantity were to soar and the US

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.200
supply is only about 8 kilograms a year.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.720
Sort of like how we talk about asteroids with
tons of platinum on them being worth several

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.080
trillion bucks to stoke up asteroid mining
interest, the basic economics of scarcity

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.610
would suggest that value would drop to a fraction
before you could sell it all.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:54.110
So while I don’t want to say the value of
Helium-3 on the moon is overhyped it’s not

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.130
really likely we’d ever be mining it from
the moon to ship home.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.710
It’s also, again, not that abundant.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.740
It’s not like there are puddles of Helium-3
lying around on the moon to be sucked up and

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.320
shipped home.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:11.130
Concentrations in general would be around
1 to 10 parts per billion on the Moon to maybe

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.800
as high as 50 parts per billion in areas which
are constantly in shadow.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.470
So if you want to come up with the 10 or 20
tons a year that would run the US powergrid

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.840
you need to be ready to plow through at least
a billion tons of lunar regolith a year.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.240
But it has some real possibilities as interplanetary
spaceship fuel meaning the Moon could easily

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.030
serve as the oil well of early and mid-stage
interplanetary travel.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.740
There’s way better sources of it deeper
out in the solar system.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.670
That’s not the only way the moon could can
be of assistance though, just a recently popular

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.670
one.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.520
We’re looking for an excuse to set up shop
on the moon permanently and in a big way,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.190
with large bases hosting dozens if not thousands
of personnel.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:57.450
Helium-3, even if we develop a reactor that
can use it, probably isn’t that excuse unless

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.720
for some reason that works out to be the only
commercially viable fusion reactor, which

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.220
doesn’t seem likely though there are some
serious advantages to aneutronic reactors

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.470
that might make it so.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.070
Still it probably won’t be, so what other
reasons are there?

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.580
Again because of the lack of air and gravity
it’s a good place to serve as a base.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.030
It’s much easier to mine the moon, and in
some ways easier to power yourself on solar

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.600
power, than it is on Earth.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.920
Low gravity makes for much easier mining and
much easier off-world transport.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.700
Lunar Regolith is very abundant in Oxygen,
Silicon, Iron, Calcium, Aluminum, and Magnesium

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.780
in that order.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:42.070
We wouldn’t ever mine those resources for
Earth itself, Earth has plenty of those, but

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.930
it’s useful for building space stations
and space ships and if the infrastructure

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.560
is in place the moon is a much better source
of raw materials than Earth for stuff off

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.330
Earth since you don’t have to lift the stuff
through miles of air and much stronger gravity.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.500
Solar power is also a pretty decent option
for the moon because it actually gets more

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.930
light than Earth, as our atmosphere absorbs
and deflects a lot of what arrives from the

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.930
sun.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.090
Also solar power is often problematic on Earth
because it goes away every day and clouds

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.310
in the sky can make it very dim.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.590
No clouds on the moon and the day is a month
long.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:21.550
The moon’s circumference is just under 7000
miles, and its day just under a month, so

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.950
even at the equator where the day-night terminator
moves fastest it still only moves a little

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.170
under 10 miles an hour.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:34.040
On Earth very fast planes can outrun the sunset,
on the moon a fast jogger could, and there’s

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.160
no air resistance for vehicles and lower gravity
so if you are mining on the moon you could

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.470
conceivably use solar powered robotic vehicles
that just circumnavigated the planet once

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:48.860
a month under perpetual sunlight and returned
to their base once a month for maintenance.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.230
We generally tend to think of moon bases as
being nuclear powered, and that’s certainly

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.320
an option, or solar-powered but running on
batteries or fuel cells during the half-month

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.070
of darkness but without air resistance and
with low gravity rolling bases are a possible

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.070
option.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:08.231
What’s more, it isn’t difficult to build
tall towers on the moon, there’s no wind

00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:12.800
and the gravity is again very low, and the
higher you are the more light you get per

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.320
lunar day because the horizon isn’t blocking
your light, there are places in the polar

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:23.380
regions like Shackleton Crater that have spots
that get sunlight 80 or 90% of the time.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.340
Since the poles are going to come up a lot
in any discussion of moon bases let me explain

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.360
that a bit more.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.040
We all know about the midnight sun and how
places near our own poles here on Earth have

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.220
months of perpetual darkness or sunshine.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.270
We also mention polar bases on the moon a
lot and places where the sun shines longer.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.800
There are places on the poles of the moon
where we expect to find more ice, the poles

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.670
are colder, and ice is good because we need
water.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.481
There are places on the poles that get light
longer, or darkness longer, than near the

00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:52.770
equator too.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.790
This isn’t for quite the same reason as
it is on Earth.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.500
On Earth, the Earth’s Axial Tilt relative
to the Sun means that higher latitudes are

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.880
constantly facing the sun for months at a
time or faced away from the sun for months

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.450
at a time.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.400
The moon on the other hand has very little
tilt relative to the sun.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.180
This isn’t the cause of the places with
long light or dark phases.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.650
There is a concept called the Peak of Eternal
Light where a spot on a rotating object around

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:25.410
a star might be lit all the time, or nearly
all the time, not to be confused with tidally

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.930
locked planets like we discussed some months
back.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:33.720
On those the sun shines on one half of the
planet all the time and never on the other.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.930
As we also discussed then, there is no ‘dark
side of the moon’, because the moon is tidally

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.690
locked to Earth, not the Sun.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:46.790
One Moon Day and one Moon year are the same
length, one Earth month long.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.110
But there are places on the moon where the
sun shines 80% or 90% of the time.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.660
And the cause isn’t axial tilt or orbital
patterns, it’s that the moon is much smaller

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.720
than Earth, with a much nearer horizon, and
that there’s no winds or tides eroding all

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.120
the craters on the moon.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.480
A mile high mountain on the moon juts out
much more than one on the Earth, and the higher

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.490
you are, the longer your day.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:13.690
Here on Earth if you climb up to the top of
a very tall building or hill or mountain and

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:18.260
your friend stays down on the ground next
to you, you can see the horizon further off

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.560
than he can.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.680
So you see the sun rise before he does, you
see the sun set after he does, your daylight

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.760
period lasts longer.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.910
We’ll take this simple globe and add a peak.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:35.240
Watch as the day-night terminator sweeps around
and hits the high point first, and then as

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.839
is sets how the high point remains illuminated
longer.

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:43.290
The higher the peak, the further it is to
the horizon in each direction.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.020
This more pronounced on the Moon because the
Moon’s diameter is considerably smaller

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.900
than Earth’s so a mile high object sticks
out more.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.230
Similarly if you were in a valley the sun
would rise later and set sooner.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.180
If you were on a mountain peak that had two
large valleys to the east and west located

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.050
where your horizon would be if it was flat
there instead the sun will rise even earlier

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.130
and set even later.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:10.480
Same concept, if you’re in a valley with
a mountain to the east and west the sun rises

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.520
way later and the sets way sooner.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.540
So if you’re in a deep crater on the moon
with large crater walls you won’t see much

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.670
light, even less than on Earth since there’s
no atmosphere scattering and reflecting light

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.630
from other directions.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.670
This effect gets even more pronounced near
the poles because the planet’s ‘diameter’,

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.580
at least in terms of the distance from the
axis of rotation, is even smaller and that’s

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.240
what is actually blocking the light.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.680
Watch as these identical mountains at the
same longitude but different latitudes have

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.310
the day-night terminator run over them.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.540
See how the sunlight leaves the ones near
the equator first?

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.250
So we often have an interest in polar bases
on the moon because they’ve got spots in

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:55.380
them that get sunlight much longer, and often
very close to places that get shadow much

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.830
longer.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:02.110
Places on the poles which are under almost
constant shadow are way better spots to find

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.119
ice, also where you’d expect to find more
Helium-3 for that matter.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:11.480
So a polar base located in a large crater
is a nice base location since you’ve got

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.220
some optimal places to put solar panels that
can run most of the time and right nearby

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.579
you’ll have dark spots where you’d expect
to find more water ice.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:25.220
Also again, because gravity is so weak and
there’s no wind, you can build incredibly

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.799
tall flimsy towers that further extend your
daylight, with solar panels or even just mirrors

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.169
on top of them.

00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:37.149
You’d still need batteries or fuel cells
but for a much shorter period of time.

00:17:37.149 --> 00:17:41.320
You could also get around this long night
issue by using power satellites that beamed

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.990
their energy down to a base.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.269
Satellites consisting of basically just a
reflective parabolic dish and some attitude

00:17:47.269 --> 00:17:53.220
controls constructed on-site would be fairly
easy to launch, as we’ll discuss in a bit,

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:59.049
and could keep an area pretty well lit perpetually,
or send it down as a power laser or maser

00:17:59.049 --> 00:18:00.480
to some receiver.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.309
For that matter the moon isn’t that big
and it’s desolate, so you could just outright

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:09.870
run power cords along the surface, or build
a few solar towers that beamed energy to other

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.379
towers not in the sun.

00:18:11.379 --> 00:18:15.799
Towers can get very tall on the moon because
there’s just no wind and weaker gravity

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:18.509
puts less compression on the materials.

00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:23.039
But that’s also not the only way to build
a very tall tower, you can rely on tensile

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:29.269
strength instead of its tall enough, that’s
the basic concept of a space elevator.

00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:33.429
As we discussed in the Megastructures video
on Space Elevators while we don’t have any

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:38.750
material strong enough that we can mass produce
to make a space elevator of earth we do have

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.029
that option for the moon.

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:45.830
A lunar space elevator is a bit of an oddball
because it has to be longer than an Earth

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.830
Space Elevator and can only point in two directions
to be stable since the Earth perturbs lunar

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.409
orbits much more than the moon disturbs Earth
orbits.

00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:59.090
The first stable one would point right back
at Earth, and the second directly away from

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.940
Earth, but that’s fine.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.850
The one pointing at Earth needs to be 35,000
miles long and the one pointing away from

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:11.220
Earth would need to be just over 40,000 miles
long to the their respective docking ports,

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.259
as opposed to a space Elevator on Earth which
would be just 22,000 miles long.

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:20.860
This is because the moon, while it has weaker
gravity, also spins much slower.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.999
The one on Mars is much shorter because its
day is about the same as Earth’s own but

00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:27.169
its gravity is a lot weaker.

00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:30.559
But the Moon’s gravity is so weak that you
don’t need any ultrahard materials to build

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:31.559
it from.

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:35.070
Same as you can build towers on the moon very
tall without much wind or gravity to impede

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.691
you, we can build a space elevator on the
moon much more easily than on Earth which

00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:45.259
makes it even better for mining to fuel space
industries in the general area of Earth.

00:19:45.259 --> 00:19:49.259
But every space elevator needs a counterweight
on the end of it, we usually picture this

00:19:49.259 --> 00:19:55.020
as some asteroid towed in for that purpose
or some very large docking facility, on the

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.580
moon that could be a bunch of mirrors in whole
or part and not only are the tops of space

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.330
elevators virtually always in the sun but
even for the short time one lunar elevator

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.770
wouldn’t be, the one on the other side of
the moon would be and you could just bounce

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.919
that light down to a base from the mirrors
or beam it down as power.

00:20:12.919 --> 00:20:17.639
And you could target anywhere on the same
hemisphere so with two elevators you could

00:20:17.639 --> 00:20:20.149
illuminate any place on the moon.

00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:25.450
Lunar space elevators are a pretty neat idea
and the added power and light advantage makes

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:30.429
them even more appealing but ground based
solar and batteries or fuel cells, or just

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:34.309
having a nuclear power plant, is probably
more practical.

00:20:34.309 --> 00:20:37.809
Also while elevators are far easier to build
on the moon they aren’t nearly as handy

00:20:37.809 --> 00:20:39.749
as they would be on Earth.

00:20:39.749 --> 00:20:44.240
We discussed mass drivers, space cannons,
and launch loops a while back and the big

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.279
issue using those on Earth to launch vehicles
is you have to make the track very long to

00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:53.309
get up to the necessary speed to escape Earth
while having a low enough acceleration to

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:55.840
not crush human passengers.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.700
This is made much more impractical because
you’ve got to keep the tunnel evacuated

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.269
of air and getting the muzzle of the space
cannon out over the atmosphere.

00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:05.639
That’s not even an issue on the moon.

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:09.659
There’s no air, and the escape velocity
of the moon is just over a fifth of what it

00:21:09.659 --> 00:21:13.972
is on Earth’s, meaning you only need about
4 or 5% of the energy and your track can be

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:19.070
much, much shorter and you don’t need to
elevate the end of the cannon over the atmosphere

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.100
because there isn’t one.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.100
To get up to Earth’s escape velocity at
just one gravity of acceleration requires

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.740
almost twenty minutes of acceleration down
a 4000 mile long track ending on towers many

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:35.390
times higher than our tallest skyscrapers
and the whole thing has to be a sturdy vacuum

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.279
sealed tunnel.

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:41.230
To get up to the moon’s escape velocity
at one gee of acceleration wouldn’t require

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:46.840
even 200 miles of track and it could just
be track, like a normal railroad.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.779
Even though building giant towers on the moon
is way easier than on Earth you don’t need

00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:55.799
them, there’s no air to flood your tunnel
or cause drag or lift.

00:21:55.799 --> 00:22:00.700
Also track length drops proportional to acceleration
so if you don’t mind subjecting people to,

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.179
say, 4 gees of acceleration for just over
a minute your track only needs to be fifty

00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:09.639
miles long, and if you’re just shooting
raw materials or fairly sturdy manufactured

00:22:09.639 --> 00:22:14.830
items up than you can get away with a hundred
gees easy and have a track just 2 miles long,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:20.780
truth be told raw materials like iron could
be shot out at 10,000 gees or more easy, that’s

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:26.370
the acceleration inside a rifle, and that
would only need to be a hundred feet long.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:31.249
So we might not build a lunar space elevator
even though we could just because using space

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:37.220
cannons is so practical and way easier to
shield from micrometeors and solar radiation,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.509
which are serious issues on the moon.

00:22:39.509 --> 00:22:42.320
You could launch stuff directly to Mars from
there.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.840
You’d still need rocket fuel, but way less
of it, and you can refine fuel on the moon.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.080
As noted earlier, lunar regolith contains
huge quantities of oxygen, aluminum, and magnesium.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:23:00.440
Liquid oxygen burned with aluminum or magnesium
is a pretty decent rocket fuel, and monopropellant

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.369
gel of aluminum powder and liquid oxygen appears
to be very promising too.

00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:10.820
We talked in the terraforming video about
baking oxygen from rocks, but in summary form

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:18.200
you could make from locally available materials
whole acres of solar ovens and still for creating

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:24.460
this fuel, which could also be used to help
power a moon base during dark phases as well.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.249
Ships could leave the Moon for places like
Mars or Asteroids via a mass driver boost

00:23:29.249 --> 00:23:33.230
and fully fueled up to speed up more and to
then slow down.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.639
Or you could ship that fuel elsewhere.

00:23:35.639 --> 00:23:40.070
Truth be told, once the infrastructure is
in place, it might make more sense to ship

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:46.190
fuel from the moon to earth orbiting space
stations refueling ships that left Earth Orbit

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.330
then to ship up more fuel from Earth itself.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:54.629
It would really depend on how easy such fuel
refineries were to build and maintain, and

00:23:54.629 --> 00:24:00.759
with the progress we’ve been making in robotics
and 3D printing that might be very easy indeed.

00:24:00.759 --> 00:24:05.130
We do want to put people on the moon, but
robots are almost certainly going to play

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:10.190
a huge role regardless especially in early
construction phases.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:15.289
Things would be a lot easier and safer, not
to mention cheaper, if your initial moon base

00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:19.830
is constructed before the astronauts arrive
by drones.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.590
Which brings us to our next point.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:27.190
The classic moon base tends to show up with
a lot of glass domes but this isn’t a really

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.190
good idea.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.820
People don’t particularly need direct sunlight,
particular raw sunlight that hasn’t had

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:38.299
the nastier stuff filtered out of it by out
magnetosphere and atmosphere, and our plants

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:40.230
wouldn’t do great under that light either.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.669
Glass is a poor protection from micrometeors
too.

00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:51.200
So you wouldn’t be building your structures
above ground, or if you did you come by and

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.480
plow over them with dirt afterwards.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.950
A couple feet of lunar regolith between you
and space is an ample shield against anything

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:02.049
you really need to worry about and because
of the lower gravity the structure doesn’t

00:25:02.049 --> 00:25:05.230
need to be too sturdy to handle that weight.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:10.009
If you need to get light in you can have glass
walls and have your roof extend well over

00:25:10.009 --> 00:25:13.429
it, then just have mirrors bounce the light
in.

00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:17.691
Those can be made to not reflect the harmful
frequencies rather easily and mirrors don’t

00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:21.029
have to be made of material that shatters
when it gets hit.

00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:25.750
So even your food crops wouldn’t be exposed
to the open sky and your actual habitation

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.879
areas would probably be as deep underground
as you could comfortably get away with.

00:25:29.879 --> 00:25:35.220
I’ve also mentioned before, in both the
terraforming video and rotating habitats video

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:40.080
that while we can fake gravity with rotating
structures in zero gravity, you can do this

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.080
in lower gravity too.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:47.279
You have to combine the natural gravity with
the spin gravity so that inside that structure

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:50.259
your perceived down is at a diagonal.

00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:55.830
There’s no air outside for drag so it won’t
take much energy to keep such a thing spinning.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:00.020
This keeps your moon men from suffering the
ill effects of lower gravity, which is very

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.029
detrimental to the body over long periods
of time.

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:09.379
Now again everything is easier if you’ve
got working fusion, which you obviously would

00:26:09.379 --> 00:26:14.159
if you were mining the moon for helium-3,
but setting up shop on the moon without fusion

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:15.840
is definitely doable.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.919
It hasn’t been done thus far because it’s
very expensive and doesn’t serve much point.

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:25.249
It also the sort of thing where you need to
go all-in, a small moon base manned by a dozen

00:26:25.249 --> 00:26:30.100
people like some polar research station isn’t
the way to go, even if virtually everything

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.100
is being run by robots.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:38.289
The moon is not Mars, signal lag time is only
a couple seconds, so even maintenance on robots

00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:42.190
could be conducted by other robots controlled
mostly real time from Earth.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.919
You don’t need a moon base for a Mars Landing,
but if you’re hoping to truck thousands

00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:51.619
of colonists to Mars and have routine traffic
and supplies going back and forth it makes

00:26:51.619 --> 00:26:57.600
that way easier to have the moon either directly
in that loop or sending fuel to stops in that

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.600
journey.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.379
And if you want to do anything serious on
Mars you do need to send people, the time

00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:06.259
lag is just way too high for practical remote
control.

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:11.210
So any serious operation on Mars or any other
location deeper out benefits from having a

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.590
lunar base feeding in fuel and material to
the travel loop.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.200
You don’t need people on the moon to do
anything if you’ve got good enough robots,

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.940
and I mean mechanically good enough not smart
enough.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.799
You could control the entire operation from
Earth.

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:29.909
But if you want people there you need a decent
number because you’re setting up a community.

00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:35.080
You’re growing food, cooking food, building
habitats, repairing your robots, conducting

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.090
experiments and so on.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:41.429
McMurdo in Antartica is probably your better
example, even in the winters there’s about

00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:45.039
250 people there and a few times that in the
summers.

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:51.130
We mentioned Dunbar’s number, around 150
or 160 people, during the interstellar colonization

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:56.179
video and as a quick reminder that’s generally
considered a good size for a community.

00:27:56.179 --> 00:28:01.320
You could get away with less than that though
since it is only a couple seconds to the moon

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.389
so while chatting on the phone with relatives
would be a bit laggy, taking 4 or 5 seconds

00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:09.950
for you to hear their reply to “Good morning
how are you?”, it’s still takes a lot

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.720
of the psychological pressures off people
in terms of those we encounter from remote

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.129
outpost with small numbers.

00:28:15.129 --> 00:28:20.700
There a going to be things where that signal
lag is too much, like performing surgery on

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.869
someone who is injured, and there’s a lot
of types of maintenance that at best would

00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:29.379
be a major hassle to do with a robot drone
and a 4 second delay.

00:28:29.379 --> 00:28:33.850
Of course if you’ve got people up there
you need to feed them, so you also have to

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:38.169
grow all your own food, it costs tens of thousands
of dollars in fuel to ship just one day’s

00:28:38.169 --> 00:28:43.239
worth of rations into low orbit and the moon
is much more expensive, so keeping a hundred

00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:47.809
people fed on the moon perpetually would be
running you billions of dollars, plus the

00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:52.379
vegetation can help recycle your air and water
and waste.

00:28:52.379 --> 00:28:57.159
This raises the sunlight issue again, because
the day last a month on the moon, meaning

00:28:57.159 --> 00:29:00.629
that except near the poles you’ve got to
cope with two weeks of darkness.

00:29:00.629 --> 00:29:04.580
Even if your plants could handle two weeks
of darkness they aren’t scrubbing carbon

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.619
dioxide out of the air while you’re doing
that.

00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:11.840
The two weeks of constant light is no big
deal, if you’re pumping your light in via

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.830
mirrors or fiber optics you just block that
or tilt it away as necessary.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:22.519
Many plants do fine, even better, under longer
light cycles, though others do not and many

00:29:22.519 --> 00:29:28.499
use it to trigger flowering so light control
is a big deal if manageable.

00:29:28.499 --> 00:29:30.480
Darkness is another issue.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.720
You can get around that at some spots on the
poles.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.279
Plants can handle a few days of low or no
light by and large and you could run some

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:43.200
lights off batteries or fuel cells or even
rocket fuel if you’re mass producing that

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.580
during light periods.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.980
Truth be told you’d probably be wanting
to run those backup lights during the day

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:54.239
a lot too, when power is abundant, since you
can boost plant growth by pumping up the wavelengths

00:29:54.239 --> 00:29:58.620
of light that are used for photosynthesis
and that lets you use less mirrors and you

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.360
can build your farm a bit more vertically
then.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.840
Which is doubly handy if you want to have
higher gravity in your farms than the Moon’s

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.979
actually got.

00:30:06.979 --> 00:30:12.090
Another nice thing about the moon is that
with those long dark phases, low gravity,

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:17.679
and no air it a pretty handy place to build
telescopes, especially the new liquid mirror

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:21.640
telescopes which could be made obscenely large.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.909
The basic concept of a liquid mirror is like
our combined natural and spin gravity.

00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:31.700
When you spin a liquid on earth it forms a
parabola from the mixture of gravity and centrifugal

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:37.639
force, a natural parabolic dish you can shape
by adjusting the spin rate of the device.

00:30:37.639 --> 00:30:41.929
We use mercury on Earth for this which isn’t
ideal for the Moon but we’ve also been having

00:30:41.929 --> 00:30:47.210
some good progress with a class of organic
compounds known as ionic salts that should

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.389
function in that role on the moon and actually
look like it might be cheaper to build on

00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:56.470
the moon than here on Earth and there’s
no air or light pollution making it even better

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.529
as a location.

00:30:57.529 --> 00:31:02.070
There’s one last object that can be built
on the moon, and can arguably only be built

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:06.320
on the so-called dark side of our moon and
that’s a giant laser.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.840
We talked about using lasers for pushing ships
to very high speeds and you’re probably

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.479
also familiar with the idea of using laser
to blow up or divert asteroids that might

00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:15.479
threaten Earth.

00:31:15.479 --> 00:31:20.740
The problem with big lasers is they are big
weapons and the dark side of the moon is called

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.809
that because it never faces Earth.

00:31:22.809 --> 00:31:27.230
If there’s one place in the Solar System
you could feel fairly safe about building

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:31.830
a giant laser that couldn’t be used as a
death ray against our own cities, that’s

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.289
the spot.

00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:36.809
Also when dealing with doomsday weapons if
you actually run the numbers on the kind of

00:31:36.809 --> 00:31:42.509
energy the things use unless you’ve got
special scifi unobtainium to get rid of the

00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:45.350
heat the entire thing ought to melt.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:49.409
You can only get rid of heat by radiation
in space, so if you build it into an object

00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:54.080
like the moon you not only get all that rock
to use as armor to protect critical components

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.659
but you can also shunt all that heat into
the moon by convection and conduction instead.

00:31:58.659 --> 00:32:02.869
That way you don’t have to big thermal exhaust
ports your rebellious son can shoot torpedoes

00:32:02.869 --> 00:32:06.769
down and blow up your massively expensive
doomsday device.

00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:10.919
The picture that gets painted here though
is that a return trip to the moon really doesn’t

00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:16.509
serve much point unless you plan to set up
permanent shop there in a fairly big way,

00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:19.809
and we’re unlikely to want to do that until
we’re ready to seriously push out into the

00:32:19.809 --> 00:32:24.419
solar system in which case the moon has the
potential to be an invaluable resource.

00:32:24.419 --> 00:32:29.239
We’re not ready yet, and it can be kind
of depressing to think that it’s been almost

00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:32.830
half a century since we last set foot on it.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:38.200
But keep in mind that while Antarctica was
first explored in the early 1800s, the first

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.739
expeditions to get to the south pole took
place decades later in the early 1900s and

00:32:42.739 --> 00:32:47.769
it was 1911 before Amundsen’s team got to
the South Pole, narrowing beating the ill-fated

00:32:47.769 --> 00:32:54.039
Terra Nova expedition led by Robert Scott
that arrived a month later in January of 1912.

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:59.919
It was 45 years before anyone returned, and
the US Navy flew in and established the Amunsden-Scott

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:04.580
Station there, about the same time as it has
been the last moon landings and the production

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.059
of this video.

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:11.129
Even then this facility wasn’t a major installation
until more recent times, being completely

00:33:11.129 --> 00:33:12.980
rebuilt in the mid-1970s.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.980
Now, just over a century after those first
two expeditions to reach the pole, it is a

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:23.000
thriving and productive research facility
manned by a few dozen in the winters and a

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.239
hundred fifty in the summer, and is one of
many such facilities in the Antarctic and

00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:28.369
Arctic.

00:33:28.369 --> 00:33:33.080
Good things take time, and just because you
can do something doesn’t mean you should.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.369
Our base on the south pole is robust now because
it’s useful, it’s vital for astrophysical

00:33:37.369 --> 00:33:39.340
and particle research.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:44.490
Whether a moon base comes about because helium-3
becomes valuable as a fusion fuel, or because

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.059
we want to use the moon to get raw materials
and fuel for projects around Earth or deeper

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:54.109
in space, or as a lifeline to Mars and other
planets and asteroids, or to build truly enormous

00:33:54.109 --> 00:34:00.200
telescopes on, or just from sheer human drive
and human stubbornness to do it, or some combination

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.389
of all those, it will happen eventually.

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:06.929
So on that note we’ll close out for today.

00:34:06.929 --> 00:34:11.419

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:14.250
free to try out some of the other videos on

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:19.150
As always question and comments are welcome
below, I try to reply to as many as I can

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:23.990
and I’m always looking for new video ideas,
this video itself came from a request just

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:27.810
a few days back when I was having a bit of
creative writer’s block for instance.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:42.490
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you next
time.
