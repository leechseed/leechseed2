00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.090
This episode is sponsored by Brilliant.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.000
The Moon has beckoned to humanity throughout
history, and it will soon be our ladder,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.620
extending our reach further into the cosmos.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.160
Today we’ll be looking at the Moon, and
how it might in the century to come serve

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.580
as a vital manufacturing and fuel refining
depot and stepping stone.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.360
Interestingly though it’s biggest role in
the near-term will likely be focused on the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.530
development of space closer to home, in orbit
of Earth as the Moon is.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.660
To see why, we first need to ask what the
Moon has to offer and how we will go about

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.460
getting stuff off the Moon.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.440
That’s a key point because while the Moon
has plenty of resources, it has little Earth

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.050
does not have vastly more of.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.650
It’s also where all our stuff is, including
our factories and scientists and engineers

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.240
and everyone else.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.640
This would lead many to think we really have
no interest in the Moon and is one reason

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.270
folks often suggesting bypassing it in favor
of Mars or other planets.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.689
And yet the biggest problem with Earth is
that it has so much stuff--as in, mass.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.240
All that mass generates a gravity well you
have to claw your way out of to get into space.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.719
It also means there’s a thick atmosphere
clinging to our world that makes it even harder

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:28.670
to launch things, though easier to land stuff,
much easier actually than on the Moon.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.130
The Moon has no atmosphere to slow ships or
cargoes down as they approach.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.820
It also has surface gravity barely a seventh
of Earth’s, and an escape velocity of just

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.710
2400 meters per second or 5400 miles per hour.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.290
Quite fast but barely a fifth of Earth’s,
and it takes less than a fifth as much fuel

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.609
to lift something off it.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.100
Gravity wells are not your friend in space
but they get far worse as we pile mass on.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.389
A rocket using a liquid hydrogen fuel to escape
Earth might need 12 tons of fuel to get a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:01.090
given payload away.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.240
Whereas on the Moon it would only require
.7 tons to to get it off the Moon.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.049
It would be even cheaper in terms of not needing
anything like all the extra mass and equipment

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.599
needed to get that spacecraft off Earth reliably
and safely, like fairings, those protective

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.200
nose cones on rockets for plowing through
the air, which of course the Moon lacks.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.060
Of course there’s precious little hydrogen
on the Moon, and it’s mostly tied up in

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.480
water-ice which we probably want to use for
other things, and there’s obviously no ready

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.560
supplies of kerosene or other hydrocarbon
fuel types either.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.290
So we’ll need to consider other types of
fuels, and for that matter if we even want

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.140
to use fuels or opt instead for alternatives
like a lunar space elevator or a mass driver.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.310
Space Elevators are nice in that they don’t
require much power to operate, but they do

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.209
take some and have other problems we’ll
get to in a bit.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.170
Making chemical fuel or running a mass driver
of the electromagnetic catapult or rail gun

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.170
variety both are energy hogs, and so we’ll
need to ask how we’ll go about getting power

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.730
on the Moon, all of which we’ll also get
to in a bit.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.579
There are vast amounts of Silicon, Oxygen,
Aluminum, and Iron on the Moon and those last

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.340
three can be used to make good fuels.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.010
Of course you mostly need fuel to get stuff
off the Moon, so let’s ask what the Moon

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.360
offers us that we want to take away from it
and where we want to take it.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.260
Fiction often shows us moon bases but tend
to be a bit unclear on what they’re really

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.719
for, and what they’re not for is growing
food.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.260
At least not for exporting.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.480
You might grow food on the Moon for local
consumption, as opposed to bringing it from

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.810
Earth, but you’d probably only use it for
feeding folks in space during the earliest

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.370
days and you just happened to find it easier
to expand local production a bit rather than

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.900
setting up space farms.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.200
We’ll examine that more in the upcoming
episode “Moon: Crater Cities”

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.940
Part of the problem though is that the Moon
has really long days, a month long, half of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.810
which is night which is a long time for plants
to go without illumination.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.739
What light it gets is also harsh, not filtered
by an atmosphere removing the frequencies

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.249
more harmful to plants and equipment.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:14.829
You could grow food there, but either need
to provide supplemental lighting or pick species

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.230
that are adapted to handle darkness for long
periods.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.480
You probably need to provide shading too,
as many plants wouldn’t fare well in two

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.360
weeks of perpetual noon-time sun.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.400
All-in-all, it makes more sense to use large
rotating habitats in orbit for food growth

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.420
instead, especially as these can be made vastly
cheaper than those rotating habitats meant

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.060
for people to live in, such as the O’Neill
Cylinder, and we’ll be discussing those

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.790
and life inside them in a couple weeks.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.130
Of course you probably do want to grow food
there initially, not to mention source your

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.780
rock, air, water, and equipment for those
space farms from the moon, where you can.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.041
Some plants you may want to grow locally for
aesthetics or as specialty fresh foods, like

00:04:58.041 --> 00:04:59.920
fruit trees or herbs.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.060
These plants may also be used to recycle waste
products of the colonists.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.020
If you are growing food on the moon you need
power for artificial lighting or rather significant

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.990
usage of orbital mirrors to send light down,
which is certainly doable and we may as well

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.650
begin our discussion of power with solar as
an option.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.480
We’ve got three ways we can use sunlight
and three places to obtain it from.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.080
We can use it for plants or other processes
that directly make use of light, like a solar

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.940
kiln for smelting metal or rock, or we can
use it for power generation, either solar

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.860
thermal or photoelectric.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.240
Photoelectric being the solar panels we’re
used to, while solar thermal is where you

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.950
use the concentrated sunlight to heat something
and run a standing heat engine, such as a

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.740
steam turbine, like we use in conventional
power plants.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.960
Solar panels are a bit problematic on the
Moon because you have that two-week dark phase,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.780
though they don’t have to worry about cloudy
weather and there are many craters whose rims

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.500
experience longer daylight periods.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.160
Indeed one of the proposed methods to maximize
the exposure of solar panels is to hang them

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.131
like curtains from tall towers, following
the sun, extending the daylight as the sun

00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.640
sets.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.520
For the same reason, polar craters are also
logical base locations due to the extremely

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.060
long daylight possible on their crater rims
and from the ice we hope to find at their

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.180
eternally dark bottoms.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.690
And again we’ll look at that more in Crater
Cities.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.310
On the photosynthesis side of things, those
extended light periods experienced on crater

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.610
rims might be sufficient to allow plants there
to remain healthy as opposed to two full weeks

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.970
of darkness, and would at least cut down on
supplemental lighting.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.560
These are good spots for initial space farming
though obviously are in a limited supply.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.990
Eventually, a lunar industrial complex will
be producing so much power for metals refining,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.030
chemical processing, and manufacturing that
a few small farms worth of LED lights won’t

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.710
really amount to much in your power budget.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.990
But in the end the vast majority of food production
will be done on large factory farms and food

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.140
processing facilities in space once the cost
of landing a shipment of groceries is less

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.160
than your local cost.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.150
Similar to how you might have an orange tree
or small garden, but your not locally sourcing

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.990
a cake recipe.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.130
But back to solar panels, modern, efficient
ones are rather hard and expensive to fabricate

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:29.420
locally from ISRU, or in situ resource utilization,
the term used for basically living off the

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.420
land.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.150
Though that might get far easier down the
road, the raw sunlight, heavy on ultraviolet,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.180
and damaging moon dust and micrometeorites,
might be rather rough on such panels.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:46.550
There are designs for less-efficient, simple
solar panels made from ISRU materials that

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.720
can almost be paved on the lunar surface.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.720
The problem with these is that they need to
be cleaned of lunar dust frequently if they

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.440
are to be located anywhere near a mining base
or rocket landing pad.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.160
They are also fixed so they can’t follow
the sun, and because there is no atmosphere

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.110
to refract or reflect the sunlight like on
Earth, this further reduces their efficiency.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.370
Fabricating more rugged or structural ISRU
solar panels, such as those we discussed hanging

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.650
like curtains, will take more resources and
cost more, but would allow sun-following.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:24.950
Lastly, while concentrated solar may allow
better use of your solar panels, they can

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:31.010
have thermal management problems in space,
further adding to their cost and complexity.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.060
Adding to solar power’s short-comings is
the limitation of battery capacity to function

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.570
through the night, away from the poles.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.520
Solar thermal on the other hand is particularly
nice on the moon because big mirrors and parabolic

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.110
dishes are easily fabricated, they can just
be shiny bits of aluminum or iron, neither

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.980
in short supply on the moon.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.830
Additionally, there’s no air, and heat can
only be lost via radiation, convection, and

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.480
conduction, so you can turn your mirrors onto
giant blocks of basalt – which is plentiful

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.230
on the moon and a great medium for heat storage
and they won’t cool off as much at night

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:12.540
as it’s just the vacuum above them, not
air or water also acting as a coolant by convection.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.100
This is especially true if we cut blocks of
basalt and basically stick them in a thermos,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.970
vacuum on all sides.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:24.350
So no convective losses from the vacuum and
only minor conductive losses in the thermos

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.230
and radiative losses can be minimized with
a reflective barrier.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.800
Quite the thermal battery.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.620
That’s a bit sophisticated, so early on
you might just use a chunk of basalt up off

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.520
the ground on insulating feet to minimize
heat loss to conduction, or in a pit where

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.020
you kept a bowl up on feet and filled it with
gravel.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.210
You can even skip that for focusing light
on a big chunk of basalt but you’d lose

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.280
more heat to conduction into the neighboring
rock.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.480
We call this approach a Thermal Wadi, as opposed
to Wadis in the desert, dry spots that fill

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.810
with water in the rainy season, in this case
we fill them with light and heat in the sunny

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.980
season, every month.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.320
Now we can attach those blocks to a heat engine
and have a nice power supply when the sun

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.300
goes down.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.490
Needless to say, you can also use these to
keep bases warm when the sun goes down, or

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.690
for that matter cold when the sun is up.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.120
You can also be using solar kilns in this
role as well as their role of melting down

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:28.730
metal or rock, and solar kilns work better
on the moon from the lack of atmosphere anyway.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.960
Using these approaches lets you avoid needing
to have a month-long production cycle that

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.120
is on during the day and off during the night,
or at least lets you avoid a total shut down

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:44.020
at night, though we often do long on and off
production cycles in some industries, such

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:49.610
as metal smelting, here on Earth, and could
on the Moon if we needed to, and we might

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.630
early on as we need to start very simple.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:58.070
It’s not very hard then, with some fairly
basic infrastructure, to get major metal production

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.330
going on the moon and it can be massively
scaled up.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.960
You benefit a lot from having clever robots
do the work rather than people but you don’t

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.700
actually have to live on the Moon to work
there.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.670
The signal lag time from Earth is just a heartbeat
or two, enough time to be noticeable and irritating

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:20.220
but close enough to allow remote control of
facilities and robots.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.430
Now I said there were three basic ways we
could use sunlight but also three places we

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.010
could get it from.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.260
The first is obviously the surface of the
Moon, and the second would be advanced power

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.510
production by nuclear fusion, where sunlight
comes from in the first place, but while we’ll

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.340
be looking at nuclear fission as a power source
and ship drive today, we’ll skip fusion

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.640
as a topic we’ve covered more elsewhere.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.350
Our third way is just to remember that the
Moon has very little gravity and no atmosphere.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:54.040
That makes producing power satellites or mirrors
and getting them into orbit a good deal easier,

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.890
and it would not be hard to coordinate those
to get power or light to places when it was

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:04.380
dark outside, scaled up enough you could even
create a 24 hour day cycle but we’ll skip

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.940
that for today.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.730
See the Power Satellites episode or Winter
on Venus for more discussion of those options.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.740
However, while putting stuff in orbit of the
Moon isn’t too hard, that low gravity and

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.360
lack of wind makes it very easy to erect massive
structures.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.420
I mentioned those tall towers and putting
our solar panels on them.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.400
Building some super-high, strong, and skinny
tower on the Moon is very easy.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:36.610
Indeed it is so easy that we can build a space
elevator on the Moon out of existing materials,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.911
not needing the very strong materials like
Graphene and Carbon Nanotubes an Earth Elevator

00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:42.030
would take.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.680
Sounds like a great idea but there is one
problem, the Earth.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.339
The Moon perturbs the orbits of objects around
the Earth somewhat.

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:55.150
But the Earth has 81 times the mass of the
Moon, and it perturbs orbits around the Moon

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.430
a lot.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.210
If you were to build an elevator on Earth,
you’d put its center of mass in a geostationary

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.210
orbit.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.640
That’s where it will orbit the planet at
the same rate the planet turns, so it will

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.270
stay directly above your chosen spot on the
equator.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:15.960
The altitude of a geostationary orbit is about
1/10th of the way to the Moon, so the Moon’s

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:21.390
gravity does perturbs the orbit some but only
to a degree we can manage and compensate for.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.770
If the Moon had a nice short day like we do,
it would work about the same there.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:31.240
But the Moon is tidally locked to Earth, so
its day is a month long, and a luna-stationary

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.630
orbit would have to be a month long as well.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.360
That means it would have to orbit the Moon
at an altitude that takes it 1/4 of the way

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:44.370
back to the Earth, a distance where the Earth
actually exerts far more force on your satellite

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.710
than the Moon does.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:51.320
There is the L1 Lagrange point between the
Earth and Moon, where the forces exactly balance

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.550
each other, and it’s only about 1/7th of
the way back to the Earth.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.120
The problem is, it’s not stable.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.100
If your satellite drifts off the Earth-Moon
axis, gravity will pull it back, but if it

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.050
drifts either way along that axis, it will
start falling toward whichever body it’s

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.760
now closer to.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.660
The L2 Lagrange point above the far side of
the Moon is similarly unstable.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.760
The only stable Lagrange points, where you
could put a satellite in a true luna-stationary

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.899
orbit, are the L4 and L5 points that respectively
lead and lag the Moon in orbit around the

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:25.899
Earth.

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:30.140
Unfortunately, those are actually as far from
the Moon as the Earth is—not very helpful

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.660
when you’re trying to build an elevator.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.540
Now again neither is stable either, and while
we can use some of the tricks we discussed

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:43.140
in space elevators, like multiple tethers
reaching up at angles to a common terminus,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.650
and also have some options for polar elevators,
it’s not a great option.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.950
Sky hooks, also known as rotavators, work
a bit better since without an atmosphere and

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:58.070
with a lower gravity and orbital speeds you
can have one swing right down and snag something

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.840
off the ground.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.050
We looked at those in detail in early episodes
of our Upward Bound series, and followed them

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:10.110
up with a device called a mass driver, think
giant space gun.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.780
Those can work on Earth but are problematic
because you need to reach higher speeds and

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:20.160
you have to use an entirely enclosed runway
or barrel to keep the air out and also have

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.520
to have the muzzle sticking up tens of kilometers
above the ground to avoid your vehicle slamming

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.840
out of the barrel into the atmosphere at re-entry
speeds.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.080
Needless to say, it’s also quite an engineering
feet to build a tower tall enough to hold

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.710
that muzzle up.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.380
That is far easier on the moon, what with
the low gravity and lack of wind in the atmosphere

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.740
shoving on that tower, but you don’t need
to bother because there’s no atmosphere

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.010
you need to get above.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.620
You can just run a long metal track on the
ground to build up speed and let go once you

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.790
hit orbital speed.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.360
All of those are options that work on the
Moon, and the mass driver is probably the

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.630
easiest and best for most applications, but
you might not even bother since again, it

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:07.280
doesn’t take too much fuel to get stuff
off the Moon and as we’ll get to in a moment,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.960
that’s likely to be the main industrial
production of the Moon, or one of the big

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.120
ones anyway.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.220
I should note though that landing stuff on
the Moon is a good deal trickier if you want

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.810
to avoid using rockets, there’s no air to
help you slow down.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:26.700
Trying to rely on sheer friction, like a runway,
is not a good idea since you’re still moving

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.600
very fast and safely coordinating that would
be dubious.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.590
The skyhooks are nice options for slowing
down, the elevator too, and one could potentially

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:42.779
harpoon a ship like we discussed in Colonizing
Ceres or even use some corridor runway filled

00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:47.920
with low-density gas for breaking,
Of course fuel works pretty well and I did

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.560
mention that would be a big export.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.110
You can make fuel out of water, with enough
power, you just break it down into hydrogen

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.920
and oxygen then burn those as your fuels,
but we don’t know how much water-ice is

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.409
on the moon and we probably don’t want to
be using that up, so it might work okay in

00:17:04.409 --> 00:17:10.319
the early days as a short term fuel but not
something we will use in the long term.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:17.559
We will need to use common lunar ISRU materials
and first among those available is oxygen,

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:22.739
of which the moon is roughly 40% by mass,
and it will practically be a waste product

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:28.110
of our industrial activities, as things like
iron and aluminum will be found as oxides

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.390
we need to seperate to get the pure metal.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:37.070
ALICE, Aluminum-Ice rockets, using nano-aluminum
powder and water ice are tempting but again

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:42.879
it uses up water, or more specifically hydrogen,
not ideal for heavy space usage.

00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:48.549
But we can use aluminum and liquid oxygen
as a monopropellant gel or as a bi-propellant,

00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:55.890
and also aluminum, iron, and oxygen, also
known as thermite, and of course Magnesium,

00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:01.390
which also has a very energetic reaction with
oxygen, is readily available on the moon.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:06.639
None of these is exactly ideal as a main ship
propellant, though they do work well enough

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:11.809
and work very well for things like station-keeping
and orbital maneuvering, which is going to

00:18:11.809 --> 00:18:17.200
be the biggest fuel usage in a robust Cis-Lunar
Economy, where most of the ships will be moving

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.570
around Earth-Moon orbital space and which
will probably be collecting a growing number

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:28.799
of space habitats, power stations, factories,
farms and so on as time rolls on.

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:33.870
The Moon however is also rich in uranium and
thorium, and noticeably lacking in delicate

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:39.370
ecologies, so it’s a great place to build
fission reactors as well as radioisotope thermal

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:45.169
generators, RTGs, one of our favorite electric
supplies for spacecraft.

00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:49.850
You can also build some disgustingly simple
nuclear rocket drives that, while filthy as

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.100
heck, enough that it would probably be a war
crime to use them in Earth’s atmosphere

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.730
or low-orbit, do well enough in deep space
or on the Moon.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:02.639
Nuclear makes a nice power supply for those
dark weeks on a moon base and RTGs, mostly

00:19:02.639 --> 00:19:07.940
made of radioisotopes like Strontium-90 or
Plutonium-238, would make excellent power

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:14.210
supplies for spaceships and satellites and
moon rovers where solar wasn’t a good option.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:21.049
Of course we also have the RTT, Radioisotope
Thermal Thruster, which differs from an RTG

00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:22.090
somewhat.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:26.950
An RTG uses thermocouples to turn the radioactive
heat decay into electricity.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:33.309
They are very durable and reliable with no
moving parts to break or wear down, and are

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:37.570
easy to build, though very inefficient at
conversion, usually under 10%.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:44.710
The RTT, or Poodle Thruster, is the same;
it just uses that heat to produce rocket thrust

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.020
instead.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:51.989
These unfortunately can not be throttled in
their thermal power output, RTGs and RTTs

00:19:51.989 --> 00:19:56.669
produce a constant power supply, though by
changing how much propellant you use you can

00:19:56.669 --> 00:20:02.600
throttle your thrust, though it slowly weakens
as the material decays, dropping to half after

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.919
one half life.

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:08.369
And of course you have all that lunar oxygen
you can use for propellant.

00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:13.539
This is also not bad for station keeping or
objects that run back and forth constantly,

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:17.659
like a shuttle between the Moon’s orbital
Station and Earth’s, assuming anyone lets

00:20:17.659 --> 00:20:21.620
you bring it near Earth, though they’re
not too dangerous if one gets wrecked and

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.970
crashes on Earth and aren’t ideal bomb material
either.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.889
We’ve never truly had a nuclear economy
on Earth, even in those places where fission

00:20:30.889 --> 00:20:35.919
makes up a large part of the power generation,
so it’s a bit hard to really state how much

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:38.230
of an industrial engine that is.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:43.590
The Moon, and space in general, is already
a radiation nightmare so being able to run

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.830
massive nuclear torch drive ships and atomic-powered
foundries, smelters, and mass-drivers is a

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.159
big deal.

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:55.620
If you go all in on that you can start turning
out aluminum and steel at ridiculous outputs,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.200
and that gives you the massive construction
capacity you need for building up a true space

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.769
infrastructure.

00:21:01.769 --> 00:21:06.830
Safety really is not an issue, but we already
detailed non-atomic options like solar kilns

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.929
if we need them instead.

00:21:08.929 --> 00:21:13.669
Nuclear is more attractive in many regards
and could turn the Moon into an Industrial

00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:16.120
Nuclear Juggernaut.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.720
So that covers fuel.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.720
Fuel for station-keeping and running around
the Cis-Lunar volume of space.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:27.210
But fuel, be it chemical fuels like Aluminum
or nuclear rockets, that can also be used

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:32.600
for running ships back and forth to Mars or
the Asteroid Belt or even out to the icy moons

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:38.970
of the gas giants to retrieve ice for water
and fuel if the Moon doesn’t have enough.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.759
Oxygen too, the Moon has plenty of it, but
not so much nitrogen or carbon and plants

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:48.950
need those too, and these are elements you
can find plentifully out deeper in space,

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.619
in the form of Nitrogen gas, ammonia-ice and
methane.

00:21:52.619 --> 00:21:57.960
Methane and ammonia are nice stable sources
of hydrogen, and methane is 25% hydrogen by

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:04.990
mass and ammonia is 18%, while water is only
11%, and the remainder is oxygen, which is

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:10.929
beyond plentiful on the Moon and as mentioned
likely to be a waste product of many of our

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:12.480
other activities there.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.490
Hydrogen is a critical item for good space
travel as it’s our best propellant, so with

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:20.690
it being rare on the Moon and hard to get
off Earth, your first big supply chain is

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.700
to get hydrogen back to the Moon.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:28.460
It’s easier to think gas giants, but actually
getting hydrogen off them is no mean feat,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:34.330
and raw hydrogen is not easy to transport,
so methane is your preferred source, off icy

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:40.000
bodies, and water and ammonia your nominal
runners up, needless to say both are very

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.220
handy for other things too.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.779
Comets are also nice sources for those.

00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:49.830
We’re trying to keep ourselves pretty low-tech
and near term in this episode, so we’re

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:54.210
focused on the stuff that’s easier to do
now in terms of both existing technology and

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:59.629
easy deployment, see Industrializing the Moon
or Battle for the Moon for some of the more

00:22:59.629 --> 00:23:01.799
high-tech scenarios.

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:05.419
But whether you’re running out to the rim
of the Asteroid Belt beyond the frost-line

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:09.990
or to the Moons of Jupiter or Saturn, that
gives us some nice imports.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:15.859
Hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen for fuel and
food production, plus all those nice metal

00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:20.679
ores that are available in the asteroid belt
and in the less mentioned but no less valuable

00:23:20.679 --> 00:23:25.739
hoard of tiny moons and asteroids around those
two huge planets.

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:30.539
You can send crews out to those and setup
bases, but extracting ices, water, methane,

00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:36.399
or ammonia, is a very easy bulk extraction
process that can probably be done by fairly

00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:43.220
dumb machines with just a few nudges by controllers
acting remotely from a light hour away, and

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:48.039
those Poodle Thrusters make a very nice ship
drive and power source for those kind of remote

00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:49.640
operations too.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.740
Poodle Thrusters do need refilling on propellant
so are good for ice mining, where they can

00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:00.419
re-stock, and I can well imagine the Moon
mass producing some sort of small probes that

00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:06.220
fly out to those icy bodies to survey them,
latch onto patches of ice to refuel on propellant

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:11.239
and drill samples, and wandered off to the
next target, with bigger collectors following

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:13.350
up for extraction.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:18.659
Fundamentally the Moon is a great source for
anything that we want in space in larger bulk

00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:23.109
quantities, like metal, but it’s also nice
for things like Rare Earth Elements that are

00:24:23.109 --> 00:24:28.470
often rather rough to get economically on
Earth while also being environmentally friendly,

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:32.450
which is fine on the Moon where there’s
no environment to befriend.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:36.700
Not a bad place to get phosphorus either,
something we have a supply problem with here

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.860
on Earth, and it should be noted that while
it takes a lot of fuel and money to get off

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.870
Earth, getting home is easy and cheap, so
you probably can export stuff that isn’t

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.639
precious metals home to Earth.

00:24:47.639 --> 00:24:49.940
It’s got precious metals too.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.179
It’s easy to forget when discussing asteroid
mining and coming home with trillion dollar

00:24:54.179 --> 00:24:59.489
rocks full of gold and platinum that the Moon
considerably outmasses the entire asteroid

00:24:59.489 --> 00:25:05.869
belt and has more of every metal than it does,
albeit sometimes harder to extract.

00:25:05.869 --> 00:25:10.570
But ‘hard’ is a relative concept and all
those wonderful craters and lavatubes make

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:15.999
nice bases to hide from micrometeors and the
Sun’s blistering radiation, and that proximity

00:25:15.999 --> 00:25:22.159
to Earth allows remote control of any device
and rapid extraction or evacuation of personnel

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:26.869
back to Earth in emergencies, or sending in
search and rescue teams.

00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:31.679
Out on Mars or in the Asteroid belt, you’re
in deep trouble if anything goes wrong, because

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:37.370
no one is coming and even advice and suggestions
by radio will take an hour to reach you, not

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.190
a couple seconds.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:43.929
For this reason and many more, the Moon is
a great place to be building up our industrial

00:25:43.929 --> 00:25:45.859
might for space.

00:25:45.859 --> 00:25:51.730
Maybe not an ideal place to live though, and
we’ll discuss some options for that in a

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.749
couple weeks.

00:25:53.749 --> 00:25:59.279
We were talking a lot today about rocketry
and orbital concepts, and those are quite

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:04.359
vital to contemplating space industrialization
but can be rather confusing.

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:08.809
If you want to get a better understanding
of this concept and a lot of other core physics,

00:26:08.809 --> 00:26:13.580
I’d recommend trying out Brilliant’s Course
on Classical Mechanics, which has almost 50

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.609
interactive quizzes including one on the Rocket
Equation.

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:21.389
Brilliant is an online learning community
with over 60 interactive courses and many

00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:26.100
quizzes and puzzles, plus Daily Challenges
that help get the brain warmed up for the

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.150
day.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.710
Those Challenges provide a context and framework
that you need to tackle, so that you learn

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:37.179
the concepts by applying them, which is the
best way to learn new concepts.

00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:41.720
Brilliant makes learning fun and easier, and
their online community gives you places to

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.889
discuss the material or ask questions, and
their mobile apps offline feature lets you

00:26:46.889 --> 00:26:50.519
take courses even when you’re not getting
a good signal.

00:26:50.519 --> 00:26:56.669
If you’d like to learn more science, math,
and computer science, go to brilliant.org/IsaacArthur

00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:58.559
and sign up for free.

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:03.769
And also, the first 200 people that go to
that link will get 20% off the annual Premium

00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:08.740
subscription, so you can solve all the daily
challenges in the archives and access dozens

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.600
of problem solving courses.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.029
So as I mentioned, we’ll be returning to
the Moon in a few weeks to take a look at

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:21.529
Crater Cities, but before then we’ll ask
the big question of why life exists next week.

00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:26.570
We also talked a lot today about how the Moon
might come to be a major colony one day, but

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.899
would most likely be powering that growth
by providing the raw materials to build vast

00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:36.330
number of habitats in orbit of Earth, in immense
space stations such as the O’Neill Cylinder,

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.070
and in two weeks we’ll take a look at what’s
it’s like to be a resident of one of them,

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.269
in “Life on Board an O’Neill Cylinder”.

00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:48.749
