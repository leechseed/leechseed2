00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.491
When discussing the options for colonizing
the Moon, as a stepping stone to the solar

00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:11.470
system, we’ll see that it’s not just one
small step for a man,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.300
but one giant industrial park for mankind.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.409
So today we will be looking at colonizing
the Moon, not just small bases but real colonies,

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:32.859
and to do that we have to discuss the reasons
why we would do that.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.680
This is not our first trip to the Moon
on this channel, and won’t be our last either.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.830
We’ve visited briefly a number of times
and even did an entire episode on Moonbase

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.830
Concepts.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.150
In spite of this there’s a lot of material
left to cover and we won’t do anything like

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.060
exhaust it today.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.000
Our focus today is on the industrialization
of the moon, essentially the reason to colonize

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.340
it with thousands or even millions of people.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.059
Not just visit, plant the flag, and head home.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.820
The Moon has a bit of a strange position
in the discussion of space travel.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.659
It remains the only place mankind has ever
visited in person, but it’s been nearly

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.640
half a century since we have been there, and
only a dozen folks have ever set foot on it.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.369
It’s a big place, with a surface area larger
than any continent but Asia, so those dozen

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.019
astronauts didn’t explore much of it.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:29.820
It’s hard to picture the moon, we
tend to envision it as a gray desert pockmarked

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.250
with craters, which is true enough, but people
tend to forget that those craters range from

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.700
the microscopic up to craters bigger than
all but the very largest nations and deeper

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.899
than the Marianas Trench.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.729
Craters big enough to swallow whole nations
and deep enough hide Mount Everest in aren’t

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.959
what we usually picture when contemplating
the Moon.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.909
We also hear a lot about lava tubes
on the moon, corridors cutting through the

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.920
stone near the surface.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.469
These can range in size a lot, and the low
gravity allows them to get quite monstrous

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.700
in size, looking less like a tunnel a mole
or worm burrowed, and more like something

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.140
one of the sandworms from Dune made.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.410
There are thought to be lava tubes on the
Moon as wide as 500 meters and many kilometers

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.410
long.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.140
We’ve got dozens of craters big enough
to house major metropolitan areas or even

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.100
decent sized nations.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.410
Domed over they are big enough to be their
own mostly closed ecosystems.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.620
You could build domes that big too, an upside
of low gravity, and as we discussed in the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.450
Life Support episode, even if a panel got
shattered, air would not leak out so fast

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.180
that you couldn’t repair it even if you
didn’t have some high-tech self-sealing

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.180
method.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.870
That’s an important thing to remember
though, all those handy craters we can dome

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.210
over exist because something big landed there,
and while ones that big are quite infrequent,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.120
the moon’s lack of an atmosphere means that
small meteors aren’t burning up before hitting

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.280
and pea-sized meteors will be hitting in your
vicinity reasonably often, though not so much

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.250
so as to be a normal cause of death anymore
than lightning is.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.840
If you lack the ability to make sturdy
or self-sealing domes, those underground lava

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.269
tubes are a lot more appealing.

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.320
Particularly since the Moon’s day-night
phase is a month long, and that light isn’t

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.379
filtered of harmful radiation by an atmosphere,
so that you will tend to want artificial lighting

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.620
anyway.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.360
You could get some interesting colonies in
a lava tube, since they’d tend to stretch

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.190
out thin and long, akin to how we tend to
develop habitats along rivers or roads.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.069
The craters and geology of the Moon, while
fascinating, haven't proved enough justification

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.110
to send more manned missions back there yet,
let alone enough to set up permanent bases,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.209
which is solidly inside our current technological
abilities, if expensive.

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.940
What we are interested in today is the step
beyond that, not purely scientific and exploratory

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.939
missions, nor prestige voyages to prove to
people you can land astronauts there and bring

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:59.939
them home.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.109
That’s why the Moon holds that strange
position in space travel, because it needs

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.780
to be the place where we settle two questions.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.640
First, whether or not space exploration will
be done only by robots, or if we will once

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.400
again stick boots on the ground of an alien
and inhospitable world.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.509
Second, whether or not we will ever do more
than explore, but genuinely get out there

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:23.979
and settle these places.

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.780
We’ve already talked about how one
can terraform planets or even the moon, and

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.509
certainly how to make comfortable habitats
on such places or orbital habitats floating

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.770
in space by themselves.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.419
We know also the ultimate goal is to spread
ourselves outward to other stars and to take

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.199
dead and barren alien planets and make them
homes for people, our pets and parasites,

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.280
and all the other eggs we keep in this one
fragile pale blue dot of a basket.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.710
But there’s a middle ground folks
don’t spend much time on, which is what

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.220
draws millions of people to the moon to live
there and work there.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.620
It’s a bit like the underpants gnomes from
South Park.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.020
They’ve got a business plan, Phase 1, collects
underpants, Phase 3, profit.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.830
Almost everybody wants to go to the
Moon, almost everybody wants us to set up

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.770
bases and colonize the place, almost everybody
wants us to send out ships to explore and

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.970
settle the stars.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.889
But we’ve essentially got the gnomish dilemma,
we know what phase 1 is, get people back on

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.330
the Moon again and set up a base, and we know
what Phase 3 is, a profitable and growing

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.210
colony on the Moon, Phase 2 is a bit of question
mark.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.270
This has gotten to the point that some
folks want to cut the Moon out of the loop

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.139
entirely and go straight to Mars, or the Asteroids,
or even Venus.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.259
I’m all for doing all three and more, but
I believe that the Moon holds the potential

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.800
to be the best foothold to truly getting into
space.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.309
And I think that means it needs to
benefit us in a very real and tangible way.

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:03.669
To demonstrate that though we have
to begin by asking what benefits the Moon

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:04.729
has.

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.330
What has the Moon got that Earth lacks?

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.719
What is on the Moon that the rest of the solar
system lacks?

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:15.289
To answer this we have to get a bit
geocentric, because the first thing the Moon

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.680
has that the rest of solar system lacks is
its proximity to Earth.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.979
The moon is just over a light second away,
meaning we can talk to people there real time.

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.740
There’s a pause of 2.6 seconds for a message
to get there and back, but that amounts to

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.200
an annoying real-time lag, nothing more.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.400
Every other object is at least light minutes
away, and constantly varies in distance.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.311
Venus is closest after that and can be as
close as 38 million kilometers, or 2 light

00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:51.490
minutes away, to 261 million kilometers, 15
light minutes away.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.349
Mars is even further off and those two, along
with Mercury, are our nearest neighbors.

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:03.270
A ship with a power plant strong enough
to provide one-gee of acceleration constantly,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.310
so that you could walk around over the engines
like you were in normal Earth gravity, could

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.020
reach the Moon in less than four hours, shorter
than many routine flights on Earth.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.250
Such a flight is very energy wasteful and
would involve flipping over halfway through

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:23.639
to slow down, usually called ‘Turnover’,
and reaching a speed of 63 kilometers per

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.639
second.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:28.879
That’s fast but not truly huge compared
to modern spacecraft, and something within

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:34.390
the realm of possibility for the fission-powered
or metallic hydrogen-fueled ships we’ve

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.670
discussed in the Upward Bound series.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:42.080
That same speed would make a trip to Mars
take more like 40 days, not 4 hours, and even

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.229
a power plant able to provide a constant 1-gee
burn would take about a week, and would need

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:49.439
to be fusion powered.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:52.180
What else does the Moon have that the Solar
System lacks?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.599
Well it lacks a significant atmosphere, but
so does every other body in the solar system

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:02.710
except the four Gas Giants, Earth, Venus,
and Saturn’s moon, Titan.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.220
Of course, obviously excluding Earth, none
of those atmospheres are breathable so they

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.680
offer little benefit, the lack of one is quite
handy for getting away from those places.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.129
Not so handy for landing on them though, since
you can't aerobrake and have to burn fuel

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.560
to slow down.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.939
However this is the same with virtually every
one of the millions of large objects in the

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:23.939
solar system.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:29.229
It also lacks much of a gravity well, making
shipping stuff out a lot easier.

00:08:29.229 --> 00:08:34.039
In fact it is so easy, especially with a lot
of the methods we discussed and will discuss

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:40.159
in the Upward Bound series, that it actually
easier to ship material from the Moon to Earth’s

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:46.760
Low Orbit, a distance of 400,000 kilometers,
than from Earth’s surface to our low orbit,

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.820
a distance of less than a thousandth of that.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.790
Truth be told one can ship mass in from various
asteroids without spending much more fuel,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.670
but only if you don’t mind waiting years
for your shipments to arrive.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.630
The Apollo missions used the lower energy
approach, so they took a lot more than the

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:09.930
4 hours a continuous 1-gee burn would take,
and still they only needed 3 days.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.730
That’s comparable to a lot of normal freight
times here on Earth, faster than low-priority

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.680
bulk freight in fact.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.930
Shipping in from other planets or asteroids
in the Belt could take many months or even

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.300
years, especially if you’re conserving fuel.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.530
Now folks often discuss the riches to be found
in asteroids, we even did an episode on it,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.880
hypothetical dragon hoards of gold or platinum.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.090
The Moon on the other hand has a composition
pretty similar to Earth’s crust, that’s

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:42.650
much of the reason we think the Moon was made
when some smaller planet slammed into the

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.750
Earth during the early days of the solar system.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.430
That means it is quite rich in materials we
like to build out of.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:54.370
Plenty of Silicon and Oxygen, plenty of Aluminum
and Iron, and surprisingly rich in Titanium.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.650
Indeed there are good odds a lot of those
craters, especially the polar ones, have ice

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.410
in them, and water is quite precious in the
inner solar system outside of Earth.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.370
Yet it’s worth remembering that ice isn’t
the only thing at the bottom of those craters,

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.389
they were after all made from the impacts
of the same meteors and asteroids folks are

00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:15.570
talking about mining.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.720
The Moon also has its dark side, which of
course is not always dark.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.320
It gets as much light as the other side, but
what it is dark to, and doesn’t get light

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.670
from, is the Earth, making it a handy place
for observatories, blocked from our glare

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.600
and radio noise.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.801
The Moon is also a good place to do dangerous
or controversial biological experiments, far

00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:40.860
from life and surrounded by lifeless inhospitable
places.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.800
Ditto possibly dangerous nanotechnology experiments.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.149
We discussed setting up habitats for living
space in the craters and lava tubes a few

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:53.779
minutes ago, but it is also a great place
for experiments with terraforming techniques

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:57.980
for small, low-gravity places, which is most
of them.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.710
We talk a lot about terraforming Mars or Venus,
but there are thousands of small rocky bodies

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:08.380
in our solar system we would want to mine
and make livable, and they will be far away

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.480
from Earth.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.389
The Moon is close enough we can fly in emergency
supplies in enough time for it to matter,

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:21.050
or supplies for projects we can’t make on
the spot, in-situ, all those asteroids and

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:27.260
moons around other planets are not close enough,
even if you are pulling constant acceleration.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.520
So the Moon gives us a place to experiment
with those techniques before we head out into

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.190
deep space, where resupply can take months
or years, and even advice from the experts

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.690
can take hours to arrive by radio.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:45.120
And if you do plan to have spaceships that
can carry out near perpetual 1-gee thrust

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.139
around the solar system, it helps to have
access to fuel.

00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:54.199
Hydrogen isn’t terribly common in the inner
solar system away from large gravity wells,

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:59.829
so the ice on the moon offers one supply,
but it also has helium-3, which while harder

00:11:59.829 --> 00:12:05.399
to fuse than deuterium and tritium isotopes
of hydrogen, isn’t too much harder and also

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:11.010
offers us aneutronic fusion, or fusion that
produces very few neutrons, which is good,

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.920
particularly for spaceships, since it lets
you get away with smaller engines that need

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.630
less shielding.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.339
But even without fusion power plants or ones
using Helium-3, the Moon is a great source

00:12:21.339 --> 00:12:22.339
of fuel.

00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:27.029
It’s got hydrogen, which is always a good
propellant even without fusion, and it has

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:33.210
also got plenty of phosphorus, sulfur, aluminum,
and magnesium, which all burn well with oxygen,

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.260
which is even more plentiful there.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.990
In addition, the Moon has a lot of KREEP,
which is short for Potassium, K, Rare Earth

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.519
Elements, and Phosphorus, and tends to be
heavy in Uranium and Thorium.

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:50.279
I also can’t stress enough the advantages
of low-gravity manufacturing.

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:55.889
Zero-gee has its own advantages, but the nice
thing about low gravity is that stuff still

00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:57.860
works like we are used to.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:03.300
In a big smelter, denser materials still sink
to the bottom of the vat, for instance.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.589
All sorts of very expensive manufacturing
equipment that has to be built very sturdy

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:11.670
here on Earth can be done a lot lighter and
cheaper too.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.440
When you’re building there you have no wind
or snow getting in the way and requiring sturdier

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.310
buildings either, so you can build huge on
the moon quite cheaply, and while actual space-based

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:28.209
construction can be very handy too, you can
build giant spaceships or even space stations

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:32.459
on the Moon and tow them into orbit fairly
easily.

00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:35.449
Here we start to see the basis for a lunar
economy.

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:38.860
Yes, tourism and science would provide a nice
subsidy.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:44.019
Yes, it probably has its own stockpiles of
precious metals in those craters.

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:48.910
But the wealth there is all those things which
we actually have here on Earth, but which

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:54.890
are far easier to move from the surface of
the Moon to anywhere near Earth than up from

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.509
Earth itself.

00:13:56.509 --> 00:14:02.220
Raw mass for construction, and fuel, are what
the Moon offers to run its economy.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:08.040
In a way, it’s like a giant orbiting warehouse,
already conveniently pre-positioned to fuel

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.060
our expansion out from Earth.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.060
Still a bit of a Catch-22 though.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:18.490
To make the moon profitable that way, you
have to be expanding out into space.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.660
One has to ask what space has to make it profitable?

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.190
Yes the moon, if industrialized, gives us
all the materials we need to expand into the

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:33.740
solar system, yes it gives us lots of practice
living in space on airless rocks, but how

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.970
are we to get to Phase 3, profit, when that
relies on supplying all the materials for

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:45.710
space expansion, we do need profit elsewhere
in the solar system to drive that on the moon.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.780
That though, we can gloss over for today,
because I still want to discuss Phase 4, what

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:56.410
comes after that solar expansion, and how
it can profit us closer to home.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:01.890
The Moon often gets treated as the gateway
to space, but tends to get ignored afterward.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:06.300
When we’re discussing terraforming other
planets in our system and elsewhere, the Moon

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.690
is always some place vaguely referenced as
having a colony on it, it becomes a footnote,

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.220
historically important but no longer useful.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.860
We’ve talked a lot about how to get folks
and material off Earth cheaper, so we didn’t

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.759
need to import stuff from the Moon to orbit,
but almost all those same tricks work on the

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:25.660
Moon just as well or better.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.770
It’s very easy to build a mass driver or
skyhook or even space elevator on the moon.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:38.050
A rotating skyhook, a rotovator, could spin
right down from orbit and snatch cargo right

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.420
off the ground and toss it into orbit, even
right back to Earth.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:48.540
Because the Moon rotates on its axis far slower
than Earth, once a month not once a day, space

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:53.290
elevators there need to be longer, but don’t
require any super-materials to build, we could

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.190
manufacture one today.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:16:00.880
The low gravity and lack of wind make tall
structures quite easy to build, that same

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.819
low gravity makes excavating and mining much
easier too, but you don’t need a supertall

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:10.680
building for a mass driver because there is
no atmosphere to rise above.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.950
Indeed with no oceans to cross, and no existing
structures or borders, one can wrap a mass

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.550
driver all the way around the Moon.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.079
You don’t need a vacuum tunnel around it
either.

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:25.410
This makes it far cheaper, just a railroad
essentially, letting you build up some very

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:30.259
impressive speeds before letting go of the
track and flying off into space.

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:35.610
All of which let’s you ship material back
to Earth much cheaper than up from Earth.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.329
Now why do I keep emphasizing back to Earth?

00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:41.980
Isn’t the point to use the Moon to get things
away from Earth?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.720
Well, yes and no.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.640
We often give a motivation for space travel
being to find new places to put people, so

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.430
we can support more of them without either
a loss in standard of living or further depleting

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.889
our ecosystem.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:59.649
I generally consider any scenario that allows
you to support more people without hurting

00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:04.860
the planet or reducing the standard of living
for those people to be by definition a good

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:10.080
thing and tend to find folks who think otherwise
a bit puzzling, which is putting it politely,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.700
and we’ve talked a lot about ways to support
more people on Earth in the Arcologies and

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.350
Ecumenopolises episodes.

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:23.060
I mentioned at the time that there was a point
between those and full blown Kardashev-2 Dyson

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:29.350
Swarms, that I generally call a Planet Cloud
or the Terran Cloud for lack of a better term.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:34.310
In this you are constructing rotating habitats
around Earth to make more space for people

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.580
to live.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.690
These differ from a Dyson Swarm in that they’re
smaller overall in terms of living space but

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.750
also far smaller and denser too.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.710
Rotating habitats are something we’ve discussed
a lot on this channel, they benefit from being

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:53.890
able to be tailored to any climate and day
length and gravity you want, unlike other

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.700
planets where it requires huge efforts to,
for instance, shorten the day or increase

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:04.080
the gravity, and they also require way, way
less material per square kilometer of living

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.380
area than a planet does.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.070
Just as an example, if we disassembled the
Moon into a bunch of 100 meter wide sheets

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:17.200
to form cylinder habitats, the Moon would
give us about 220 billion square kilometers

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.890
of those sheets, about 500 times the total
surface area of Earth and a few thousand times

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.020
what we have in terms of reasonably habitable
land area.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.300
That would be about a quarter of a billion
classic O’Neill Cylinder Habitats incidentally,

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.530
but there is actually more than enough room
for that many in Earth’s vicinity, places

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:42.370
within a few light seconds where real time
communication is possible and where those

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:47.100
would still be spaced out enough to not bump
into each other or block light from each other

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.240
or Earth below.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.260
Sounds like an ambitious task, especially
if you’ve joined the channel only since

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:58.070
the Upward Bound Series began, which is about
half the audience, but since we routinely

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.990
discuss disassembling stars for fuel or moving
them and whole solar systems, or even whole

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:09.380
galaxies, the construction of a Planet Cloud
is probably about a 3 out of 10 on the logarithmic

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:14.970
scale of hard tasks we discuss here, with
a ten being to collapse all the galaxies within

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.620
about billion light years of here into one
gravitational bound region that won’t be

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.630
ripped apart by the Expanding Universe, and
doing that only with known physics and no

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.510
faster-than-light travel.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.950
We like to think big on this channel.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:34.390
In that respect, constructing a bunch of up-sized
soda cans in orbit for folks to live on is

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.560
not terribly difficult.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.750
Particularly since you can build them one
at a time, as needed, to house folks who want

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.310
to have more living space while staying near
Earth.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.330
They do require a lot of mass though, even
just one fairly small version of them, would

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:54.830
require far more material than everything
we’ve ever launched into orbit combined.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.640
Even with the systems we’ve discussed for
getting folks off Earth cheaper, none of them

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.820
are really suited to moving that much mass
let alone cheaply.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.170
Not from Earth anyway, not even the Orbital
Ring which we still haven’t covered in the

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.860
Upward Bound Series, but is basically the
grand-daddy of cheap transport of huge quantities

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.080
of material into space.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.220
So there’s your profit source to fuel colonizing
and industrializing the Moon for purposes

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:24.440
beyond far-distant space colonies and various
scientific efforts.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:30.620
You are using the Moon to mine and manufacture
all that infrastructure and living space around

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:36.380
Earth so you can house tens or hundreds of
trillions of people in relative comfort and

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:42.290
proximity to Earth, without needing to turn
Earth into some concrete-covered megacity,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.930
and you can do it in stages, one station at
a time.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.750
With better automation and different work
environments, it’s hard to put anything

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:54.780
approaching a solid figure out for the kind
of workforce needed to build an O’Neill

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.280
Cylinder, but I’ve calculated it a few different
ways off current market costs for materials

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.160
like steel, aluminum, and titanium, and the
ballpark figure is about a million folks working

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.740
for a year to provide the construction material
for one of them.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.930
We’ll assume a lot more automation involved
so that all the support industries and services

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:19.100
needed on the Moon to build one per year would
be a million people including their kids and

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.690
other dependents.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:25.400
If you wanted to produce a Planet Cloud in
less than geological times you’d need to

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.220
be working on many of them at the same time,
maybe taking a decade each to assemble the

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.540
structure and have thousands at a time you
were working on once things ramped up to full

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:42.090
production, but under these kinds of values
we can easily have multi-million if not multi-billion

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.790
person populations on the Moon.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:50.680
Indeed I could easily envision a trillion-person
Ecumenopolis Earth commissioning about a thousand

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.180
a year to house about a billion new people
a year total, or more, and needing a roughly

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.780
comparable workforce of about a billion to
build the things.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:06.490
Scale always gets a bit disorienting when
we start talking about even Kardashev 1 civilizations,

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:11.190
let alone 2’s or 3’s, what we’ve discussed
here would be at least a couple centuries

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.791
down the road.

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:17.310
Early on those colonies on the Moon might
be thousand-person installations where they

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:21.840
are working on a way more modest space station
to house a few thousand folks commissioned

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.560
by, say, Brazil, to support their asteroid
mining fleet which is mostly delving for gold

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.150
and platinum.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.380
Everything is done incrementally.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.050
We bring up this massive case of a multi-billion
population on the Moon to show that there

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:41.370
is a potential large and long term industry
there not just for getting folks out to other

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:46.590
planets and stars but directly tied to Earth’s
own normal economy.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:52.050
We see that industrializing the Moon can go
a lot further than a few bases helping supply

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:58.710
fuel and raw material for principally scientific
endeavors in the next century or two.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:03.660
Of course to get all those colonists to the
moon, or to all those orbital habitats, we

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:09.040
need much cheaper ways of getting folks into
space which can also be upscaled to allow

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.100
transports of thousands if not millions of
people a day.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.330
We’ll discuss one such system, launch loops,
this month.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:21.950
After that we will be discussing predicting
the future, and the idea of Psychohistory

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.550
from Isaac Asimov’s classic Foundation series.
