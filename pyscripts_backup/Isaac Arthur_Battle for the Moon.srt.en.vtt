00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.380
The Moon’s brightness has guided mankind
through the night since before we were humans.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.600
But literally and figuratively, our Moon also
has a dark side…

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.779
In the last couple of years we’ve seen renewed
interest in returning to the Moon and a point

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.970
often raised is that there’s not much purpose
served by short trips to collect more rocks.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.440
If you’re going there, you should be setting
up shop in a fairly permanent way, and not

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.590
just some small base for strictly scientific
research.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.070
What we imagine using the Moon for as our
space industry develops isn’t some small

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.350
base but a vast network of industrial facilities
housing thousands to millions of people who

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.730
live there for years at a time, if not permanently.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.870
We looked at some of these back in our episode,
“Industrializing the Moon”.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.280
Such scenarios are still rather far off, not
something we’d see for decades at least,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.390
but it raises the concern of how such colonies
might develop over time and interact with

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.560
each other, and that will be our focus for
today.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.479
We don’t see many deep looks at the Moon,
it’s always a waypoint in science fiction,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.119
a place we see in its early stages but ignored
afterwards in favor of focusing on distant

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.299
planets.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.520
Now we haven’t been back there in a while,
but we have been there.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.280
Because of this it’s lost some focus in
science fiction and doesn’t get the consideration

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.079
it used too, the same as how a lot of scifi
was set in Antarctica or the deep seas in

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.630
the early 20th century but less so nowadays.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.689
That’s a pity because whether it’s the
moon, the deep sea, or the arctic poles, these

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.740
are still very unexplored places that have
played a big role in humanity’s development

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.420
and will play an even larger one down the
line.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.959
I particularly enjoyed Andy Weir’s new novel
set on the Moon, Artemis, and much like his

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.500
earlier work, the Martian, it has a good amount
of hard science in there, but also has a compelling

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.550
character as the protagonist, and it really
gives us an immersive look at a moonbase that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.750
many hundreds of people call home, and how
a culture can arise there.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.780
That human part of the equation is our major
focus for today so it seemed a great choice

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.290
for our Audible book of the month.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.290
You can pick up a free copy of “Artemis”
today, and also get a 30-day trial of Audible,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.290
just use my link, Audible.com/Isaac or text
Isaac to 500-500.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.420
So when it comes to colonies on the Moon,
when the place starts hosting thousands of

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.330
people, there’s still not too much room
for conflict, the Moon may be a lot smaller

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.920
than Earth but it still has a total land area
in between Africa and Asia in size.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.270
Similarly, until the place has a net population
of at least a modest-sized country, all those

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.340
various bases are going to be utterly tied
to Earth.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.340
This isn’t some distant colony after all,
it’s one where even our early spacecraft

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.900
only needed a few days to reach and where
light lag is minimal enough to allow real

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.580
time communication, just with irritating pauses
of a couple of seconds.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.430
There’s no isolation requiring a need to
be autonomous and self-sufficient, like interstellar

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.650
colonies have, and to get colonized to the
point that you have a big population on the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.750
Moon, it’s got to be exporting things or
providing services, giving it a very tight

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.990
trade tie to Earth.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.020
We have to put ourselves into a time when
the population is at least a few million,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.190
and that also means that it’s not really
Earth and the Moon either.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.740
Such a setup strongly implies a huge orbital
infrastructure around Earth, and probably

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.720
the Moon too, with lots of objects in the
space between the earth and the moon, Cislunar

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720
space.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.060
The whole point of the Moon, in terms of developing
a serious foothold there, is to supply vast

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.270
amounts of raw materials for building up that
orbital swarm around Earth and extending our

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.690
foothold to other planets.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.860
So if you’ve got millions of folks on the
Moon, enough to contemplate real conflicts

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.550
with each other or Earth, it’s because you’ve
been supplying that construction material

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.150
for space expansion and could easily have
hundreds of millions of folks already working

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.650
off Earth.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.070
If the Moon is big enough to have bits of
it thinking about sovereignty in a serious

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.130
way, it’s because expansion into space has
truly kicked off and there’s probably other

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.630
smaller colonies on other planets and in the
Belt, plus vast amounts of space habitats

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.630
around Earth.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.130
Now there’s a chance that the whole Moon
might rebel as a unified group, and could

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.960
do so at a smaller population than millions
of people, but it doesn’t really seem very

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.020
probable.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.450
If there’s to be major industry on the Moon,
that’s industry many folks will want to

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.840
get involved in, and no one will be in a position
to monopolize that in the current international

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.270
setup or anything likely to evolve in the
near future.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.910
If it’s attracting serious industry there’s
the economic aspect, which is cause enough,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.250
but the Moon would include concerns of prestige
and security too.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.040
This tends to imply early colonization will
either be a vast unified international effort,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.970
in which case it’s unlikely to be a place
where the residents are suffering vast oppression

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.040
or neglect, or it’s likely to be a collection
of various separate facilities with separate

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.460
founding entities and motivations.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.310
Neither is very likely to foster a moon-wide
rebellion.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.190
They might have many shared concerns but we’ll
probably be looking less at an emerging lunar

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.810
culture and more at numerous subcultures.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.040
You’d have folks living in lava tubes and
others living in craters, some of which are

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.780
small and some of which are the size of major
nations back here.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.420
Geographically, unlike Earth, the poles are
particularly attractive places to live, largely

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.750
because we do want the ice there, so you’ve
got concentrations of bases in the north and

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.750
south.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.730
You’ve also got a light side and dark side
divide.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.540
The Moon’s Dark side isn’t dark in the
classic sense, it gets the same sunlight as

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.669
the rest, but we can never see it from Earth
and they can never see us.

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.290
That makes it a great place for telescopes
and receivers for long distance transmission

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.590
or power-beaming, the dark side of the Moon
is the one place in this solar system you

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.240
can build a massive laser system for pushing
spacecraft or blowing up rogue asteroids that

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.340
cannot be pointed at Earth.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.930
For the folks on the Dark Side, Earth is never
visible, for the folks on the light side,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.530
it hangs there all the time.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.940
The moon rises and sets on Earth, it waxes
and wanes, but on the Moon, the Earth does

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.630
not rise or set, though it would wax and wane,
and it would be a good deal brighter to them

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.729
than the Moon is to us with it more or less
hanging in the same part of the sky all the

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:05.780
time, though which part of the sky would still
vary depending on where you were on the Moon.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.530
Days on the moon last a month, the sun will
just slowly crawl across the sky, no air so

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.740
no blue skies, no pastel sunrises.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:21.390
When it sets the night lasts for a couple
weeks, but Earth is still there, very bright.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.639
I think this would have a pretty big impact
on people.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:29.900
When we talk about distant colonies going
independent, they almost have to from day

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.389
1 because Earth is so far away, but it’s
only a couple seconds of transmission time

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:39.100
away from the Moon and not a long flight either.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.150
So Earth is never far away nor out of sight
and mind, particularly for the light side.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.970
Folks living on the Dark Side or Lava Tubes
at least would not actually see humanity’s

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:55.020
homeland constantly hanging overhead, and
that might make a difference.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.500
To the folks living in the crater domes or
in the Moon’s own orbital network or living

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.860
a nomadic existence on regolith extraction
tractors rolling around the dusty surface,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.880
Earth is right there.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.300
A lovely, fertile paradise overflowing in
water in contrast to their bleak and sparse

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.370
landscape, always visible and just a phone
call away.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:23.600
Unlike every other colony humanity has ever
created, every colony we will ever create

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.540
after that, far away on distant alien worlds,
the Moon will still be in that window of time

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:35.140
and space where sons and daughters can migrate
there and still call home.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.390
There’s very different types of bases on
the Moon, very different lifestyles for those

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.270
living there, different priorities, different
founding cultures they are still connected

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.020
to, different cultures will emerge on the
Moon, but they may differ from each other

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.200
more than from their founders back home.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.720
In that respect, a conflict between two entities
on the Moon seems more likely than with someone

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.970
back home, and it is likely to be someone,
not the whole Earth.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:10.270
For one thing, that would be suicidal, whatever
scifi says about having a strategic advantage

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:15.870
from fighting at the top of a gravity well,
as we saw in our episode on Planetary Invasions,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:21.120
it isn’t a very big advantage, albeit moon
bases enjoy a lot of other advantages over

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.190
an orbiting fleet.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:29.399
The other thing is it isn’t you versus Earth,
it would be you versus Earth and that massive

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.970
orbital infrastructure between you and it.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:37.800
The various habitats and industry in orbit
around Earth and in Cislunar space are probably

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.060
going to outnumber the folks on the Moon all
by themselves.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:48.260
After all, the Moon would have grown by providing
the raw materials to build those areas up.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.370
Just as an example, the Moon is likely to
have mass drivers and rail guns for launching

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.291
cargo, and such a thing could be adapted to
launch kinetic missiles back at Earth, but

00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:03.440
because the Moon is tidally locked in orbit
of Earth, any mass driver built for that is

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.970
always aimed in the same direction, down a
single corridor that you can defend, and is

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.310
built to sling large payloads into orbit of
Earth.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.320
That’s not an ideal weapon.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.440
Alternatively, Earth probably would have its
own orbiting mass drivers, and odds are many

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:26.770
of these would be purpose-built for defense,
be it an attack or a breakout of Kessler Syndrome,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.790
particularly since even a minor conflict in
Earth Orbit could result in that exponential

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.110
collection of debris without them.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:40.950
Now, when we say conflicts, we are not necessarily
talking about a war or violence or even necessarily

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.310
hostility.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:47.890
In practice in current times that’s often
a losing route to gain an objective anyway,

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:53.200
a lunar economy is one that’s going to be
very dependent on trade, and while the sailing

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.190
ships of the past could convert to warships
or pirate or smuggler ships very easily, that’s

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.980
a lot harder with spacecraft.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:08.210
Not the warship part, as we often point out,
an unarmed spaceship is an oxymoron, but you

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:13.510
can’t just sail over the horizon and raise
the Jolly Roger and do some privateering,

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:19.220
no vessel is moving around Cislunar space
with any secrecy as to where it is or what

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:24.279
it’s been up to, and smuggling is rather
tricky when every port of call has specific

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:26.410
airlocks everything moves through.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:31.850
There are some advantages the Moon enjoys
strategically though, as I mentioned, and

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.400
one of those is those airlocks.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.990
On the Moon, from day 1, every place is a
bunker.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:45.260
Every door is a vault, and odds are even individual
rooms in someone’s home have sturdy airtight

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.840
doors and backup air supplies and carbon scrubbers.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.630
Every room has some little monitor built in
watching for little dips in air pressure or

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.130
changes to air chemistry.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.640
Most of the habitats are likely to be at least
partially underground, quite probably under

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:08.780
meters of lunar regolith and possibly sporting
a point defense system for blowing up micrometeors.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.870
Consider the effect that has on one’s mindset,
and that could spill over to other areas.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.710
Early settlements aren’t likely to have
been big on privacy either, so you could easily

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.980
have very security-conscious civilizations
emerging there.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.430
There’s also some ready made soldiers hanging
around, in at least three types.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:33.690
First off you’ve got the mining crews, those
folks will be very used to wearing spacesuits,

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:39.520
which convert easily to wearing battle armor,
and using explosives and mining equipment,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.620
in other words the skill list you need for
raiding or invading another moon base.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:50.190
Second, you’ve got all those ships, and
it’s not that most modern vessels tend to

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.870
have a navy mindset because so many of the
crew are former navy, it’s that the entire

00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:00.620
navy mindset more or less evolved from what
the norm on ships tended to be.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.269
Ships are not run democratically and you don’t
quit mid-voyage or decide you don’t feel

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:09.370
like following orders today, and there’s
not much reason to think a spaceship would

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:16.519
be any different, as of nowadays, two-thirds
of current or former NASA astronauts are current

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:21.410
or former military, and the ratio is quite
high in other space programs too.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.351
There will be a lot of ships coming and going
from the Moon and a lot of orbital facility

00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:31.330
security forces at the various ports and even
those who don’t have a military background

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.910
are going to be a pretty easy conversion to
troops if you need them.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:40.170
Third, you’ve got those nomadic miners we
mentioned in passing.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.209
You can make a pretty good analogy for the
Moon with the old colonies and city-states

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:46.110
of classical Greece.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.850
The only difference is all those crater or
lavatube cities have no real interest in holding

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.760
random large bits of territory.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.060
There’s no farms or forests producing a
regenerating supply of goods.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.540
All that regolith has plenty of materials
in it we want but you don’t set up shop

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:08.490
on a chunk of it and keep steadily supplying
a harvest, you harvest and it’s done.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:14.420
You’ve also got low gravity and no air resistance,
so you can make some very big harvesters that

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:20.560
sweep over places and get what they want and
move on, possibly never stopping.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.540
You could get ones big enough to house a whole
clan, or caravan collections of smaller ones

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:31.100
holding families, as opposed to farmsteads,
though you might have some of those too, domes

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.339
growing food that don’t move around.

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:38.700
For those harvesters, they just head from
place to place collecting minerals and mapping

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:44.480
spots and stopping to trade in their haul
for other supplies, a nomadic existence.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.769
Now, just because nomads have traditionally
been among the most elite fighting forces

00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:55.560
in Earth’s history doesn’t automatically
make them that on the Moon, but like the miners,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.250
they’ll have to be comfortable getting in
and out of spacesuits and operating with less

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.529
safeguards in a hostile environment.

00:15:01.529 --> 00:15:06.750
What’s more, they are the group most likely
to have weakened ties to entities back home.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:12.140
They trade with the neighbors and move around,
which means they are also a handy way to sneak

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.740
spies, saboteurs, or Trojan Horse invasion
parties into various bases.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:22.390
They are also likely to be the group folks
go to who want to leave their own base, possibly

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.771
the home for those who aren’t very welcome
in their own habitat anymore but can’t go

00:15:26.771 --> 00:15:27.959
back to Earth.

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:32.880
It wouldn’t be hard to imagine such a group
having less than friendly relations with a

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.680
lot of bases they visit for trade.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.450
In short though, the Moon is likely to have
an advantage in terms of living places already

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:46.459
being rather fortified and much of its workforce
being easily converted to military personnel,

00:15:46.459 --> 00:15:48.580
likely many of its industries too.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:53.480
It would probably be the biggest manufacturing
hub off Earth itself, and factories of the

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.639
future are likely to be a lot more versatile
and faster to switch over production on, plus

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:04.280
it is the most obvious place to be locating
defense industries for space.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.470
Just because some group has a lot of defenses
and weaponry doesn’t mean they’re hyper-aggressive

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.920
but in general, if you’ve got a lot of muscle,
muscular solutions to problems tend to be

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.320
a bit more attractive.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:22.730
In any conflict, peaceful or not, you inventory
your tools and resources, and those of your

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.779
opponents, and look for an edge.

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:30.950
And again, it need not be violence, be it
outright warfare or various covert activities.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.540
You might funnel it into sports instead, much
as the Olympics was intended for.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:41.300
And since exercise is going to be vital on
the Moon to avoid muscle and bone loss, and

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.870
since you have many new or different sports
there with the low gravity, you might have

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.649
fairly active sports leagues fairly early
on.

00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:54.420
Another potential economic boost for the Moon,
such games might be popular to watch back

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.410
home.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:02.730
Of course such things can cause intense rivalries
or feuds too, we did have one war ignite over

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:08.180
a soccer game in 1970, one of those wars that
tends to only be remembered for being surprising

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:16.380
or confusing, like the US-UK Pig War of 1859
or my own state’s war with Michigan in 1835.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.950
I should note though that while such events
tend to be remembered little and mostly for

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:25.750
how embarrassing or weird they seem, they
were usually quite important to folks doing

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.110
the fighting or just the final straw in rising
tensions.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.360
Often such events were life and death issues
for the folks there, and were simply seen

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.670
as minor to third parties outside or in distant
capitals.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:44.120
While the Moon will always be a quick phone
call from home, such things will be a factor

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:50.220
in more distant colonies, and even then, close
or not for communications, a remote colony

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.160
of a few thousand folks having a murderous
dispute with their neighbors is still likely

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:00.160
to be seen as a minor and trivial event by
whichever major nation state of tens of millions

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.010
of people is their sponsor back home on Earth.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:08.170
That alone could be the sort of thing that
triggered a move for independence, if you

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.580
feel like your home is being neglected by
the empire it’s part of, one that treats

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.760
it as a footnote and doesn’t really get
its problems, that’s cause enough to seek

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.760
self-rule.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.540
There need not even be any oppression or blatant
neglect or malice on their part, or even the

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.360
perception of it, just the feeling that they
don’t understand your needs and aren’t

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.160
trying hard enough to or are even just incapable
of it.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.030
A delayed shipment of repairs parts for carbon
dioxide scrubbers or an unwillingness to pay

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:42.549
the license fee for an improved design for
one would seem a trivial thing to revolt over,

00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:44.760
but it wouldn’t be to those revolting.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.950
Now, how would such a conflict occur?

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.720
Obviously that’s impossible to say, as we
note in our space warfare series, military

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.530
tactics change with each conflict and new
bit of technology, and even a very minor invention

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.690
can utterly shift the dynamics.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:06.380
However, if it turns violent there’s the
obvious option of nukes.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:11.600
The Moon has uranium too and it’s quite
likely to be a big chunk of their economy.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.960
Absent fusion or solar power satellites, fission
is your obvious power source on the Moon,

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.590
the waste is easily disposed of and it’s
easy enough to build a reactor there, whereas

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:28.100
fossils fuels, wind, and hydroelectric are
all off the table, and anywhere away from

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.690
the poles and their Peaks of Eternal Light,
you have those two-week long nights which

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.990
make lunar solar power difficult to use.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:41.410
Additionally, while we’re reluctant to use
atomic rockets on or near Earth, they are

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:46.620
one of the best ways to make interplanetary
ships move and also ideal for mining missions

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.210
to the Asteroid Belt; the Moon is likely to
have a thriving industry for mining and enriching

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.210
uranium.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.550
It’s also trivial to build a missile when
you have rocket parts all over the place and

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.820
those rockets don’t need to get as fast
as on Earth to circle the globe or fight through

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.570
an atmosphere.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.630
On the other hand, they’re much easier to
shoot down without that atmosphere in the

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:13.500
way and moving at low speeds for suborbital
trips, not to mention that the Moon will almost

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.690
certainly have a bunch of orbital facilities
with intercept systems designed to hit superfast

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:24.490
targets in the first place, to deal with micrometeorites
and various debris or garbage lost by ships.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:29.080
Also, again, sneaking stuff in, especially
something as hard to conceal as a nuclear

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:34.260
device, is difficult when entry is through
airlocks, not thousands of kilometers of minimally

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.690
guarded borders and coasts.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.980
You might be thinking that when we’re talking
about nukes, you don’t actually need to

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:45.679
get it into a base, but remember most will
be underground in whole or part and due to

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:50.150
the lower gravity and lack of atmosphere,
it’s very easy to pile several meters of

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.490
regolith on top and around your base.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:58.950
Nukes are quite powerful but not magically
so, a low-kiloton device detonating a few

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:04.400
hundred meters from your base has no normal
shockwave as there is no air, but would not

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.460
blast through a meter-thick section of stone
at even that short a distance.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:14.140
It’s also unlikely to get the whole facility
even if it cracks it, after all, as we mentioned,

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.480
odds are good every single room has an airlock
on it.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.070
Which is not to say they’d be an ineffective
weapon, hardly, but they aren’t going to

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:28.150
be as effective compared to back on Earth:
there’s no fallout, there’s no radiation

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:34.190
concerns, and no extensive killer atmospheric
shockwave as everyone already lives in an

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.470
airtight, radiation-shielded bunker.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:41.730
But it’s still a weapon of mass destruction
and it still has all that political fallout.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:47.160
At least in modern civilization, whoever deploys
a nuke first is almost destined to be viewed

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.710
as the bad guy in any conflict by outside
parties.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.200
Odds are good a lot of lunar colonies would
have a nuke if they wanted it, and they’ll

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.210
only get easier to manufacture as automation
improves, but many would likely view it as

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:05.220
merely a defensive weapon, an ace up the sleeve
you can use to keep the enemy from escalating

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.030
things too far.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:11.950
For those purposes you don’t even need one,
just credible rumors that you have them and

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.420
the basic capability to make them.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:19.419
In that context we obviously can’t rule
out nuclear conflicts on the Moon but they

00:22:19.419 --> 00:22:21.630
wouldn’t seem particularly likely.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.980
We can pretty much rule out chemical weapons,
they’re not very useful in an environment

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.510
where every breath of air is filtered and
monitored, and biological weapons are not

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:35.890
much better, and those carry an even worse
stigma than nukes or nerve gas too, you’re

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:40.370
almost guaranteed to become a pariah state
if you use them and the conditions there make

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:44.840
them hard to use and even harder to conceal
the source, there’s going to be logs of

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.910
every visitor after all.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:51.289
On the other hand, the Moon is exactly the
sort of place where you’d keep your more

00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:56.270
dangerous biological laboratories and it is
a lot easier to sneak in a small vial of a

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:01.190
plague concealed as the inkwell of a pen or
even just a tiny capsule implanted in someone

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:08.090
they could remove, viruses are tiny and reproduce,
you technically only need one copy of it.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.780
You also don’t necessarily need to sneak
it in, you could probably have a tiny dart

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.160
missile drone that could fly into the side
of a base and burrow in and be guided to a

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.150
place it can infect.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.630
Still, probably not a likely attack vector.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:26.910
What would seem more likely, beyond non-violent
conflicts like trade wars, sanctions, blockades,

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:31.580
or proxy hostility through sports, would be
more like small raiding parties of infantry

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.040
trying to sneak in through boring tunnels
with mining equipment or commando teams who

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.970
got into the port and attacked there or concealed
weapon components while traveling innocuously

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.640
or even made or acquired them on-site.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.450
Infantry is more viable there too, as it’s
likely to be lots of tight corridors rather

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.770
than a place you’d deploy tanks, let alone
aircraft, which for obvious reasons aren’t

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.700
likely to be a major chunk of any lunar arsenal.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.520
Drones might be quite common too, we discussed
those recently in “Attack of the Drones”

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.220
and while the flying kind might not be common,
we’d certainly expect a lot of ground-rover

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.640
and rocket propelled drones to be on the Moon
for normal peacetime usage.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.850
So lots of options and scenarios for how colonies
might emerge and what their attitudes will

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:24.820
be and why and how they might move for independence
from Earth or have conflicts with each other.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.090
We can’t possibly cover them all, but I
hope it’s given you some food for thought,

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.940
the Moon’s been less popular in fiction
in recent decades and a lot of the previous

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.080
stories are a bit dated.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:40.190
So hopefully we've got a clearer and more
updated view now on such future bases, it’s

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:43.980
an important topic and one we’ve been neglecting
in my opinion.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.929
I’m glad to see that changing, largely I
imagine because folks like Space-X have managed

00:24:48.929 --> 00:24:54.299
to make it seem more plausible that bases
on the Moon might happen in our lifetime,

00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:57.850
not as it often seemed around the turn of
the century, as a thing that would just keep

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.620
getting pushed back another 20 years.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.340
One of the best of these new novels is our
Book of the Month, Artemis, by Andy Weir,

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.420
author of the novel the Martian from which
blockbuster movie was adapted.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:15.220
I loved the film and the book, in large part
because the science was good and the protagonist

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.600
and his challenge felt realistic and empathetic,
and they didn’t need a high body count or

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.929
mustache twirling villains to make it exciting,
sadly a rarity in fiction.

00:25:24.929 --> 00:25:30.110
Artemis is his second novel, set on the Moon,
and again we get immersed in a compelling

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:35.660
character who solves their problems with cleverness
and who makes mistakes like a real person,

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.280
though there is more classic action in it,
and it is exciting, it doesn’t feel like

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.990
some implausible world-shaking story.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:47.940
Good choice in the narrator for the audiobook
too, Rosario Dawson gives a good performance

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.860
and some extra life and flavor to the protagonist,
Jasmine “Jazz” Bashara.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.820
The novel varies a lot from the Martian, but
keeps that focus on good hard science and

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:03.429
technology, and unsurprisingly I have a soft
spot for sci-fi authors who clearly do their

00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:04.539
research.

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:08.490
This is Weir’s second novel and I’m hoping
for many more.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:15.400
If you’d like a copy of Artemis, just use
my link in this episode’s description, Audible.com/Isaac

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:21.780
or text Isaac to 500-500, and right now, for
a limited time, you can get 3 months of Audible

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.410
for just $6.95 a month.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:28.190
That’s more than half off the regular price
and you can give yourself the gift of a number

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.610
of great audiobooks for passing the time this
winter.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:36.240
An Audible membership is also a great gift
for other folks, you get to give someone a

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.520
book but don’t have to worry if they like
it, since they can pick out or exchange for

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.870
ones they like.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:47.030
Before we getting to the upcoming schedule,
I did a couple of interviews this last week

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:52.500
over on the Non-Sequitur Show and with my
friend Paul on Facebook, we had some very

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:58.290
fascinating discussions, and I’ll link those
in the video description below.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:03.150
Next week we’ll look at another common staple
of sci-fi, freezing people for voyages or

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:08.080
putting them in stasis or suspended animation,
in “Sleeper Ships”.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:13.270
The week after that we’ll discuss a topic
that is very uncommon in scifi but more common

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:19.169
in fantasy, as we at last return to the megastructures
series to look at building artificial flat

00:27:19.169 --> 00:27:21.610
or disc shaped planets.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:26.360
