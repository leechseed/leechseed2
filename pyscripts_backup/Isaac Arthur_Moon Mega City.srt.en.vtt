00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.030
This episode is brought to you by Brilliant!
We often imagine a future in which the Moon

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.760
is inhabited, with domes and outposts scattered
around it’s surface, but what does a truly

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:20.160
developed and colonized Moon look like a thousand
years from now?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.820
So today we are returning to one of our favorite
places in the Universe, our nearest neighboring

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.630
world, our own Moon, to contemplate the idea
of a late stage colony of the Moon when it’s

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.809
reached populations as high or higher than
Earth itself currently has. We’re going

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.600
to ask what the Moon would be like if it was
home to many billions or even trillions and

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.219
what pathway might lead to it becoming a single
massive worldwide mega city… what we call

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.980
an Ecumenopolis.
This is not our first time visiting the Moon

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.790
here on SFIA, I try to get an episode in about
the Moon and Mars each, about once a year

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.469
or so, and for the Moon we began Moon Base
Concepts back in early 2016, then Industrializing

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.570
the Moon, Battle for the Moon, Moon: Industrial
Complex, Moon: Crater Cities, Return to the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.320
Moon, and then last year, Mars First vs Moon
First. In all those episodes and as side topics

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.840
of many others, we have discussed how to get
a base on the Moon and grow those to be real

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.950
cities and colonies, and some of the possible
long range fates of our Moon.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.030
How to make the Moon a titan of industry fueling
our expansion into space. How to terraform

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.170
the Moon so it’s green and blue in spite
of its low gravity, and even how to raise

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.729
that gravity by putting an artificial small
black hole in its center. And we’re going

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.290
to begin by discussing those last two options
in conjunction before moving on to look at

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.360
making the entire Moon one vast, three dimensional
sphere of a city.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.930
However, when it comes to those last two,
terraforming the Moon and altering its gravity,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.340
it ignores the development of communities
there and the problems of terraforming a built-up

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.200
and colonized Moon, and it ignores that raising
the gravity on the Moon would alter its geology.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.350
Terraforming an inhabited world is just not
the same as a dead one. The internal meat

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.190
and bones of a world are based around a certain
gravity, multiplying it sixfold to Earth-normal

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.780
gravity would be ruinous to everything there
including buildings we previously made. That

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.300
can be managed but it’s a pretty big hurdle
especially given the structures and locations

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.060
most sensitive to a change in gravity would
probably be all the old historical early buildings

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.620
we made there, as well as an early domed ecosystems
whose organisms had had the most time to adapt

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.770
to low gravity.
What’s more, terraforming a planet is inherently

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.890
destructive to the existing landscape. As
an example, everything we call a ‘mountain’

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.900
on the Moon is really a giant crater rim wall,
or portion of one, they are tall and sharp

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.090
and would never last on Earth where gravity
and air and water would bring them down in

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.200
short order.
On the Moon, those ideal first bases are expected

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.240
to be in the bottoms of those craters, and
we would expect those to be the foci of further

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.750
colonization, hence why we did an episode
called Crater Cities, but if I terraform the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.010
Moon, then those deep craters valued for the
ice we suspect is at their bottoms, now become

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.490
lakes and seas, right over top of the original
cities. Now they could persist under water

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.670
as domed cities but that rather defeats the
purpose of terraforming the Moon so they can

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.590
get rid of their domes.
The Moon can never really keep air and water

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.340
we put on its surface, without constant and
major replenishment, the gravity is high enough

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.780
that random room temperature air or water
molecules won’t go anywhere, the escape

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.530
velocity of the Moon is around 5 timers higher
than the speed the air molecules would be

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.340
moving at, but even Earth leaks with an escape
velocity almost 5 times higher than the Moon’s,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.200
and that leakage rate would scale exponentially
as you dropped the mass. So you either have

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.620
to dome it all over – which is certainly
an option – or you raise that gravity and

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.480
just buttress the world, or you pay a constant
replenishment cost of running megafreighters

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.830
of nitrogen in. So raised gravity seems the
best of the three options. We have a few problems

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.100
though, the first and most obvious of which
is that we don’t know how to make artificial

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.540
small black holes, we just have some guesses
as to how it might be accomplished. I would

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.310
also guess that as fast as the Moon might
leak air, even without a protective magnetosphere,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.190
which we could add, that it would still be
small compared to the amount of mass needed

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.881
to raise the gravity.
Assuming we can make small black holes, then

00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:31.850
one big advantage that planets that utilize
them have over normal planets is that they

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.950
can be made of super abundant materials like
hydrogen, helium, or potentially even dark

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.940
matter; meaning you don’t have to use up
all your rarer building materials like iron

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.570
and carbon and and nitrogen and silicon on
generating gravity. Indeed the main value

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.020
of hydrogen and helium, which make up virtually
all the normal matter in space, is to make

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.250
energy out of them or to make heavier elements
via fusion. As we’ve discussed before, black

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.600
holes are vastly better and more efficient
power generators than fusion – and indeed

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.270
better at nuclear transmutation of elements
too. So you can stick a small black hole in

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.470
the center of a world, in a hollowed-out chamber,
buttressed via active support, and slowly

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.860
grow a black hole by dumping hydrogen and
helium into it, and use that generated power

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.080
to run your world.
Now to make the Moon have Earth-like gravity

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.450
on its surface doesn’t require as much mass
as the Earth has. The Moon masses only 1.2%

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.181
what Earth does, but has 7.4% of the total
surface area, and when you’re aiming for

00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:34.910
gravity equal to Earth on some sphere shaped
object, the total mass something needs, to

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.460
have Earth gravity, is directly proportional
to its surface area. A tenth the area, a tenth

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.841
the mass of Earth, a hundred times the area,
a hundred times the mass, like Saturn, whose

00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:49.920
surface gravity is very close to Earth’s
and which has about a hundred times the surface

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.639
area and mass of Earth. This technique works
on any world, be it some tiny asteroid a few

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.100
kilometers across or some sprawling mega-Earth
a few million kilometers across, see our episode

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.040
Mega-Earths for more of the details on building
and engineering such worlds.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.930
So the Moon masses 1.2% of Earth and would
need 7.4% of Earth’s mass to have Earth-like

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.240
surface gravity. This means we need to add
6.2% of Earth’s mass to the Moon via such

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.500
a black hole, or 5 times its current mass,
which makes it rather debatable which is being

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.430
added to which, given the black hole would
be more massive. Not bigger though, such a

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:33.190
black hole would be 1 millimeter wide. Which
is actually very large for an artificial micro

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.670
black hole and makes feeding it regular matter
so much easier.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.240
Now less gravity would probably be fine for
people, Mars’ gravity might work fine – and

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.460
if you’re curious, this black hole trick
would work fine on Mars too – but has the

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.960
same problem for terraforming there. The Moon’s
surface gravity would now be 100% of Earth’s,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.540
but its escape velocity from the surface would
still be lower, 5.8 kilometers per second,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.120
more than twice its current value but still
only half of Earth’s and about 20% higher

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.550
than the escape velocity of Mars. Mars has
no real atmosphere or oceans but we suspect

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.690
it might have in the past, and the gravity
was enough to keep them for long times but

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.190
not for 4 billion years, so that extra 20%
might be enough or it might just slow the

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.890
escape down to billion year timelines which
is good enough for terraforming – nothing

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.150
lasts forever be it a planet or a megastructure
or a hybrid of the two, you need to replace

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.821
and repair. You could go bigger too, expanding
the Moon to be a hollow shell of Earth size

00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:38.370
and mass, making Earth a genuine double planet,
and we will come back to that later in the

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.400
episode.
Now the other problem is that black holes

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.130
are great power generators. You can add mass
straight into one, in a way that wouldn’t

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.080
cause power release, but if you are generating
power while adding mass, you’re getting

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.840
somewhere between 20-40% of the mass energy
of that matter released as energy. So you’re

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.930
potentially talking about releasing something
like the current entire mass energy of the

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.330
moon in the process of feeding it up to Earth
Gravity. You’re not exactly being wasteful

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:11.030
by skipping power generation either, all that
energy isn’t free. If you convert 20% to

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.430
energy on the drop into the black hole then
you need 20% more mass to get that desired

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:21.199
final mass. Whereas, as we’ll see in a moment,
even slowly adding in the last 1% of mass

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:26.410
over a billion years would easily power the
Moon that entire time.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:33.930
See a Moon-Mass of energy is 6.5 x 10^39 Joules,
which is half a million years of solar output,

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:39.640
or the amount of sunlight that falls on Earth
alone in a quadrillion years, or the Moon

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.201
in 14 quadrillion years. And that sunlight
is what keeps Earth and the Moon warm, so

00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:49.900
even just adding that mass energy in at the
same rate the Sun gives it to those worlds

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.420
would mean roasting the folks on it by doubling
their power input, and would take 14 quadrillion

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:00.200
years, fully a million times longer than the
Universe currently exists.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.330
Now we might be building for those kinds of
timescales. Black Hole powered civilizations

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.589
regard the normal starlit era of the Universe
that will persist for the next 100 trillion

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:15.160
years as that irritating early period of the
Universe where big clumps of useful fuel were

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.920
inefficiently burning away their value of
their own accord and exploding when they were

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.570
done. 100 Trillion years is nothing to their
timescales and they have the energy efficiency

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:31.060
to outlast all the stars in the Universe a
trillion times over again.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.980
Nonetheless it’s a long time for us to wait
and so you would presumably be adding that

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.181
mass in a lot faster to a black hole in the
center of the Moon or some other planet, and

00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:44.339
I suspect trying to get it in there and quickly,
is not going to be a clean process with no

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:48.991
energy produced, so this trick is likely to
need to be a slow one. Or you could make it

00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:54.240
far away and move it there but that has its
own very tricky issues, since you can't magically

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.490
turn off its gravity or inertia when they’re
inconvenient. Probably anyway, for all we

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.090
know we might find some gravity or inertia
manipulating technologies and if they’re

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.130
possible then I’d think they’re likely
to be discovered before the Moon is home to

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.520
billions of people. I’m not optimistic on
such technologies but regard them as vastly

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.390
more likely than FTL or Time Travel. Once
you’re at a good mass though, you can keep

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:23.170
adding mass at the rate you want for its energy
and using it to power your civilization, just

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.960
the last percent of a percent of the desired
mass would power you for trillions of years.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.460
And so this is one path to a future Moon,
one in which it has had its mass raised and

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:38.950
had oceans and atmospheres added to it. Earth
is not unaffected by the Moon gaining 5 times

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.330
its current mass but that is manageable and
you could be using a little of that mass and

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.690
energy to push the Moon a bit further from
Earth to keep the tides on Earth of similar

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.580
intensity. Or you could build sister Moons
into a Kemplerer Rosette around the Moon or

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.410
rebuild the whole moon as a big donut around
Earth. You could also increase earth's own

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:04.110
mass, as we looked at in our culminating episode
of the Earth 2.0 series, Matrioshka Worlds,

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:09.360
where we envisioned an Earth with layer after
layer of hollow spherical shells each artificially

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:16.120
lit and full of land and sea, sharing the
same mass for gravity on many surfaces.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.029
Which is another possible fate of the Moon,
as such a Matrioshka World, and indeed given

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:25.450
you would be adding so much mass to the Moon
to do all of this, a Matrioshka layer of nested

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:30.250
spherical worlds would seem more likely than
a single shell, especially as while the Moon

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:36.070
is low in mass compared to Earth, it’s made
of mostly the same stuff as Earth’s surface

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.060
– this is the major reason why we think
the Moon was formed by ancient collision tearing

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.839
much of Earth’s surface off. The Earth might
be 80 times the mass of the Moon but the Earth’s

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:49.700
crust is only around 1% of Earth, so you could
turn the Moon into a earth-crust-thick shell

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.110
as big as Earth’s crust and still have mass
to spare, and of course could make thinner

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.550
layers given you don’t need a crust that
thick. You just disassemble the Moon and rebuild

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.230
it as a shell around a black hole of Earth’s
Mass.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.839
The nested shell Matrioshka version might
be more popular though given that the Moon’s

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:12.040
month long day and night already require artificially
lighting, hence underground or lower layer

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.420
habitation is probably easier to sell to people.
Of course the Moon could also be spun up to

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.680
a 24 hour day but the energies involved in
that are also pretty enormous.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:28.160
And this is another fate for our Moon, disassembly,
possibly for some world building, possibly

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.870
to build a fleet of a trillion colonization
vessels to sail out and claim the galaxy,

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:38.110
possibly to build a swarm of O’Neill Cylinders
and other space habitats and infrastructure

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.870
around Earth, which is easier without the
Moon swinging around gravitationally perturbing

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:49.180
everything. Hence why other artificial moons
or a Donut Moon around Earth might be popular.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.250
Now we did not raise all those other scenarios
strictly as alternatives to our Moon slowly

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:59.050
turning into one vast city or Ecumenpolis,
but rather, many are roads we might follow

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:04.500
at the same time. For instance, every city
needs its parks as well as its ports, and

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.430
it’s possible a lot of Moon habitation and
industry will be underground for safety but

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.980
that early domes on the Moon would be about
landing ships or having gardens, where losing

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:19.230
one to a cracked dome represents less of a
loss and risk compared to a home or school

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.560
or office, and such a habit might persist
into a future that sees the Moon terraformed

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.090
on its surface but principally inhabited below.
The key notion whenever we discuss domes on

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:34.520
airless worlds, incidentally, is that while
one meteor slamming in at kilometers per second

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.800
could blow a dome to pieces and kill everyone
inside, those would be rare and easier to

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.950
detect and destroy with point defenses, and
be vastly outnumbered by smaller rocks and

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:50.519
pebbles wearing or cracking a dome or blowing
a dime sized hole in one. Air leaks into the

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:55.490
vacuum of space at roughly the speed of sound,
so a dome the size of a football field with

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:00.480
even a fist-sized hole in it to the vacuum
is not causing everyone to collapse suffocating

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.490
or get sucked through the hole and turned
into sausage on the way out. Plus such domes

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.060
probably have thin wire mesh in their panes,
or a layer of plastic like with shatterproof

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.790
windows, not some big sheet of glass that
would shatter. Nonetheless it would seem unlikely

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.220
many folks would feel comfortable living and
sleeping directly under a big dome without

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:24.200
additional layers, like being underground
would offer. And again there’s no 24 hour

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.480
day there, it gets dark for two weeks in a
row and sunny for two weeks, maybe not something

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.140
folks want to live under. It's hard to guess
but at the very least, early on we would expect

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.631
a lot of Moon colonization to be buried in
the sides of craters, or under them, or in

00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:45.630
the vast lava tubes underground, and artificially
lit.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:50.420
From this, especially with Earth probably
growing its cities ever more vertical and

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.250
other space habitats being essentially rings
or cylinders you live inside, we might assume

00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:01.270
an underground growth on the Moon and downwards
would be popular from the outset.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:06.709
Skyscrapers are much easier to build on the
Moon due to the low gravity, lack of air,

00:15:06.709 --> 00:15:12.930
and lack of Earthquakes, but they are exposed
to being hit too. Truth be told, a skyscraper,

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:17.690
especially something in the arcology megascraper
zone, are vastly more resistant to meteor

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.500
strikes than a big dome is, and more so if
you have a bunch of these scrapers under a

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.640
dome but still connected via their own protected
or air tight tunnels, you have a lot of redundant

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.860
protection for folks on the surface living
in them. You can also have some clever features,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.721
like a cannon that shot airbags at cracks
in the dome if the dome punctured, or that

00:15:37.721 --> 00:15:43.750
shot at folks exposed to the vacuum and encapsulated
them in an air bubble and protective sheath.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:48.560
Those people also might be effectively immune
to being spaced into a vacuum, due to being

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:54.130
covered in smart matter like we’ll discuss
next week or being rather transhuman and cybernetic.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:59.320
We’ve looked at all sorts of other safety
features spaceships, space habitats, and dome

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.690
colonies might employ down the years too.
So I don’t want to give the impression that

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:09.070
surface-living on the Moon and surface cities
are not viable unless the place has been terraformed

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:14.329
and with a black hole crammed in the middle.
Still, while building up is easy, so is building

00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:20.060
down. Excavating on the Moon is easy, the
regolith is nasty stuff full of sharp edges

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.180
that are rough on equipment but the gravity
is lower which makes everything else about

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.890
excavating and building down easier. For that
matter, Stanford developed an interesting

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.840
vine-like growing machinery that might get
around that whole regolith cutting and ripping

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.980
issue.
Keep in mind, we have lavatubes on the Moon

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:42.110
in which you could fit football fields, and
which can be many kilometers long too, and

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.930
it's not that the moon forms those better
than Earth, it's that lavatubes, especially

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:51.829
big ones, have more problems lasting on Earth
with earthquakes and water and air and gravity.

00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:56.029
Digging down and building up are easier on
the Moon, but the big difference is that when

00:16:56.029 --> 00:17:00.840
you’re digging down, you are surrounded
by tons of rock that’s fairly airtight in

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.510
its own right and easily covered with a sealant
to minimize small leakage. On the surface,

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:12.579
building up, you either build under a big
pressurized tent or you build then pressurize,

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:17.639
and unless you built very thick, meters, not
centimeters, odds are good you’d be springing

00:17:17.639 --> 00:17:22.399
leaks as you pressurized that building, or
found them when the tent around it was removed.

00:17:22.399 --> 00:17:27.439
Now, that low gravity lets you not only build
taller or deeper more easily than on Earth,

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:32.059
but it also lets you contemplate heights and
depths you never could on Earth. There’s

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:36.649
no end of atmosphere on the Moon, it’s got
none, so all the buildings need to be pressurized

00:17:36.649 --> 00:17:41.650
anyway and they’re not getting hammered
by wind and storms. Or earthquakes, there’s

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:46.679
much less of an infernally hot mantle below,
which makes building deeper easier because

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:51.840
there is much more crust than on Earth. We
do believe the Moon has a liquid iron outer

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.909
core and mantle but far smaller and deeper
down. Of course running into magma and lava

00:17:57.909 --> 00:18:03.919
monsters isn’t the real limit on building
deep on Earth, we max out much shallower.

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:08.609
We usually put the limit on cave depth at
about 2 miles or 3 kilometers underground

00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:13.730
because of the pressure of overlying rock,
and we do have some mines as much as 4 kilometers

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:18.970
deep but these are almost exclusively gold
mines, because tracing a vein of gold that

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.299
deep is about the only thing worth the effort
of trying to excavate, shore up, and maintain

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:26.879
such a tunnel for.
Something to keep in mind is that even your

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:31.590
air is getting compressed down there by air
above, and can be twice the pressure of that

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:36.690
up here on the surface, and has to be pumped
down refrigerated, into an insulated shaft

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:42.480
to make it a bearable temperature for the
miners. Now robots may do better one day but

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.980
that doesn’t interest us much for living
accommodations, but since gravity on the Moon

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:52.029
is a sixth of Earth’s, we could go 6 times
deeper before the air rose to that pressure.

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:56.960
What’s more, there’s no air on the Moon
so it’s not leaking down through various

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.580
cracks to raise that air pressure. If I take
a big jug of water, the pressure at its bottom

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.280
is higher than it is on top, and if I place
another jug on top of it, that jug presses

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.230
down to raise that pressure further. However
if instead I sit them on a shelf, one below

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:17.489
and one on the shelf above, then the one above
does nothing to add to the pressure. With

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:22.580
that in mind, on the Moon you can circumvent
that pressure issue by just having air locks

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:28.010
– which you would have anyway – separating
levels every so often, maybe every kilometer

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:33.850
at most. And thus your pressure need not rise
as you go deeper, and even at its core the

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:39.471
Moon is only thought to be about 1300 to 1400
Celsius, or around 2500 Fahrenheit, where

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:46.269
as Earth’s core is about 5200 Celsius or
9300 Fahrenheit, nearly as hot as the photosphere

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:49.889
surface of the Sun.
And that means you can build very deep on

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:55.450
the Moon, indeed we do have metals able to
withstand that core temperature, many of them.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:00.200
The pressure might be harder though, especially
in conjunction with temperature, as its core

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:06.200
pressure is about 45,000 atmospheres. Which
is nothing compared to Earth’s core, which

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:12.259
is 80 times higher at 3.6 million atmospheres,
but that’s still about 10 times the pressure

00:20:12.259 --> 00:20:17.230
at the bottom of the Kola Super Borehole that
got 12 kilometers deep. Still it's inside

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.100
the realm of what we can plausibly do, even
without some of the more extreme methods we

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.149
looked at in our episode Accessing the Earth’s
Core, which means even a tunnel right through

00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:31.359
the middle of the Moon is viable.
For those who have seen the movie Total Recall,

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:35.440
the reboot rather than the original, you might
recall they had a train shaft that went right

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.830
through the center of the Earth between Europe
and Australia. There’s not much reason to

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:45.580
do such a project on Earth but it works much
better on the Moon, you just drop down a shaft,

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.159
and you will accelerate as you fall – especially
if it's already a vacuum – and gravity gradually

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:57.200
decreases as you fall, until it drops to nothing
at the core then reverses, so the same gravity

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.530
that sped you up, slows you down on the way
back up to the other side of the tunnel, which

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.450
theoretically makes this manner of travel,
cost you no energy at all, though in practice

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.149
you’d probably need a little to overcome
friction on the train system.

00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:14.840
Now on Earth that means a journey of just
40 minutes and maximum velocity of 8 kilometers

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:20.080
per second, which is roughly the same as low
orbital speed right over our atmosphere and

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.129
that is not a coincidence since both have
to do with falling around the planet. Orbital

00:21:25.129 --> 00:21:30.029
Speed right over the Moon’s surface is 1.6
kilometers per second and that’s the maximum

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:33.649
speed you’d reach falling through a shaft
bored right through the Moon, all the way

00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:38.679
down to the center and back out again. The
time it takes to fall, assuming a sphere of

00:21:38.679 --> 00:21:44.590
uniform density, is π times the square root
of the sphere’s radius divided by the gravity

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.590
at the surface, and is a formula that dates
all the way back to Sir Isaac Newton and his

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:55.759
original work on gravity, physics, and calculus.
Needless to say, worlds are rarely of uniform

00:21:55.759 --> 00:22:02.720
density but it tends to give a decent approximation,
and for the Moon, with a radius of 1.7 million

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:12.200
meters and a surface gravity of 1.6 m/s²,
that gives us a time of 3250 seconds, or 54

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.440
minutes.
Weird that it takes longer than on Earth right?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.070
Well not really, the Moon isn’t as dense
as Earth, the denser the sphere the faster

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.929
you fall through it, something that is pretty
handy if you’re trying to build black hole

00:22:24.929 --> 00:22:29.659
wormhole gates. For this same reason a satellite
right over the Moon actually takes longer

00:22:29.659 --> 00:22:35.269
to orbit it than one right over Earth does,
for all that Earth is much bigger. If you’re

00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:41.059
curious, it's 42 minutes on Mercury too, which
has about the same density as Earth even though

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:46.450
it’s about a twentieth our mass, just over
a third our diameter, and has only 38% of

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:52.659
our gravity. Your fall time – or orbit time,
as it is basically just half an ultra-elliptical

00:22:52.659 --> 00:22:57.859
orbital path - rises with the square root
of the radius, but surface gravity of a uniform

00:22:57.859 --> 00:23:03.600
sphere is dropping with the square of radius
from gravity weakening with distance and rising

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.989
with the cube of radius as it encompasses
a bigger volume and thus more mass, so that

00:23:08.989 --> 00:23:14.979
surface gravity of a uniformly dense sphere
rises with the radius, double the radius,

00:23:14.979 --> 00:23:19.240
double the surface gravity.
Thus your orbital period or drop times are

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.419
rising with the square root of the radius
divided by the radius, or it washes out. A

00:23:25.419 --> 00:23:30.919
big sphere of Earth’s density but way bigger
radius has that same drop time, however, density

00:23:30.919 --> 00:23:36.409
is altering gravity linearly, twice the density,
twice the mass in a given sphere, twice the

00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:42.070
gravity, but it’s still under that square
root, so drop time falls with the inverse-square

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:47.979
root of density, 40 minutes for Earth, about
half that for something 4 times denser and

00:23:47.979 --> 00:23:52.340
twice that for something a fourth as dense,
which would generally be your icy moons or

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:57.019
dwarf planets like Pluto.
A little bit of physics and gravity sidetrack

00:23:57.019 --> 00:24:01.899
there but the show is called science and futurism
and I am a physicist so I like to sneak some

00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:05.539
in when I can, don’t worry, there’s no
quiz.

00:24:05.539 --> 00:24:09.090
In any event, these kinds of tunnels don’t
actually have to bore all the way through

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:13.159
the core, they can run at tangents through
a planet like if you jammed a needle through

00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:18.649
an orange, in one place and out the other,
regardless of if it passes through the core.

00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:23.649
The problem is, on Earth, that orange peel
is still proportionally thicker than our crust

00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:28.840
so these sorts of gravity trains are not really
practical on Earth. You’re not really getting

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.669
up to bullet speed for trains running at a
maximum depth of maybe 4 kilometers requiring

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:39.600
hyperstrong vacuum tunnels. In truth it wouldn’t
be a needle straight distance either, your

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.629
shortest-time tunnel in a case like this is
a hypocycloid, a curve rather than a straight

00:24:45.629 --> 00:24:51.899
line, and allows us to contemplate, on a place
like the moon, gravity train tunnels all over

00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:57.109
that world, that move you around it very quickly,
right from the bottom of one crater city to

00:24:57.109 --> 00:25:02.289
another, far away.
Now why does this matter? Well my thinking

00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:05.929
is that if you are building crater cities
and connecting each to each other by such

00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:11.480
hypocycloid tunnels, for quick, easy and safe
travel, then much like any highway with exit

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.869
ramps or train path, you might have build
ups near and on these, especially as it's

00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:20.379
not hard to stop the train part way through
and store some drop energy. It’s not like

00:25:20.379 --> 00:25:24.059
interstellar travel through a vacuum where
stopping cost and starting part way through

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:29.289
the journey cost you as much as the original
journey, this costs you no energy, and since

00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:34.509
you’re presumably dropping down an electromagnet-covered
shaft, there’s a number of options for low

00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:42.779
or no energy turns and stops including utilizing
a simple flywheel, which work great in a vacuum.

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:47.950
These are your fastest paths too, including
launching up into space and back down again,

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:52.529
except for some of the extreme and fuel-crazy
options we contemplated in our High-Tech Search

00:25:52.529 --> 00:25:56.330
and Rescue episode.
We’re also talking maximum speeds of about

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:01.210
a kilometer a second here, after a drop of
10 minutes, as that would already put you

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:06.070
300 kilometers down under the surface, deeper
journeys could get you all the way up to that

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:12.909
1.6 km/s orbital or core speed but even at
100 kilometers deep you have already hit 353

00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:18.099
meters per second, just over the speed of
sound here on Earth, and truth be told, it

00:26:18.099 --> 00:26:22.019
doesn’t take much energy to stop or start
in a vacuum with something to grab on and

00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:27.779
shove off of. A one-ton car going at that
speed has a kinetic energy of just over 60

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:32.139
million joules, half a gallon of gasoline.
So we’re not talking a ton of energy to

00:26:32.139 --> 00:26:36.200
stop for a pause and get back going even if
the system doesn’t include regenerative

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.190
braking options and such.
This means along those big hypocycloids between

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.880
the bigger crater cities, or lavatube cities
for that matter, you are likely to have a

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.359
lot of pit stops like you do on highways.
This decade’s pit stop becomes next decade’s

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:55.249
truck stop and then a town and then maybe
a city in its own right. So we could easily

00:26:55.249 --> 00:26:59.700
see a big expansion all over the surface of
the Moon, like we discussed in battle for

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.470
the Moon, while at the same time we had an
ever growing number of these tunnels and the

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:08.009
growing habitation around them. All the more
so because these are great places to put a

00:27:08.009 --> 00:27:12.779
long skinny rotating cylinder to serve as
rotating gravity spots so that residents or

00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:17.629
visitors could experience gravity closer to
terrestrial standards.

00:27:17.629 --> 00:27:22.460
One other thing driving this expansion is
that folks live on the Moon for a reason and

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.269
the big reason would seem to be mining raw
materials, and such hypocycloids represent

00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:32.539
very low energy ways to launch spaceships
too, they are very easily modified to serve

00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:38.080
as a mass driver or space catapult. It would
not be surprising to see mining follow along

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.870
these paths to get dual use as basically creating
a highway or freight line while producing

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.700
the valuable ores that will be feedstock of
a lunar economy.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.769
Now, speaking of localized gravity, I suppose
it’s only fair to point out that a single

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:55.249
big black hole isn’t the only option for
gravity on the Moon. If you’re good with

00:27:55.249 --> 00:28:00.229
your black hole generation you could have
dozens of smaller ones forming a grid beneath

00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:06.179
a city on the surface giving it higher gravity
locally. You can do this same trick on high-gravity

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:12.179
worlds to lower gravity in a city by suspending
them above it and it absolutely works on paper

00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:17.090
but has always struck me as way more dangerous
than a single big one at your planet core,

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.870
or moon core. These can be used for power
generation as needed and indeed if they are

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:27.940
small and numerous enough, they could generate
power via Hawking Radiation. One able to provide

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.349
Earth-like gravity a hundred meters away generates
a few hundred watts that way, and you could

00:28:32.349 --> 00:28:37.870
potentially make a floor of them in some hexagonal
grid layout every dozen meters or so, so that

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.240
might give you a nice plane of gravity and
power generation.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:46.590
This is one trick for artificial gravity plating
like we see in science fiction and generally,

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.639
gravity will not drop much as you get higher
from those plates until you are as high or

00:28:50.639 --> 00:28:55.669
higher than the plates are wide as a whole.
Lookup calculating the gravity of an infinite

00:28:55.669 --> 00:29:00.380
flat plane if you want that explained, we’ve
already done a bit more math today than I

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.909
prefer our episode’s contain. So as long
as your city is at least as wide as it is

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:11.129
tall you can use a giant plate full of micro-black-holes
for gravity generation. Note that on the surface

00:29:11.129 --> 00:29:15.409
of the moon this would mean you would have
an upside-down under city where the gravity

00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:21.729
was 67% of Earth normal but pointed upwards
and outwards, not down, since your plate is

00:29:21.729 --> 00:29:26.840
presumably generating less than Earth gravity
as the Moon provides some too, and it's subtracting

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.609
it instead of adding it when upside down.
So there are potentially some weird tricks

00:29:31.609 --> 00:29:36.279
for making coin-like cities with heads and
tails, on or off planets, or hanging over

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:42.070
top one too. All right, one other note on
gravity before we move to why the Moon might

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:47.409
become a Mega-city. Expansion of a planet,
by digging down and hollowing it out and using

00:29:47.409 --> 00:29:52.369
that material to build higher levels, lowers
pressure and gravity as you hollow it out

00:29:52.369 --> 00:29:57.379
and make it wider. That makes your gravity-drop
tunnels slower by a bit, as you make your

00:29:57.379 --> 00:30:02.460
world bigger and less dense. Note that having
all your gravity at the core in a black hole

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.409
makes the drop faster than a uniform sphere
of the same mass too. However as folks core

00:30:07.409 --> 00:30:12.019
out the Moon to make more living space and
mine it all, it is likely a lot of the spoil

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:17.240
will be moved back up to the surface for construction
and on long timelines and with vast industrial

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.990
might, this starts getting you the many-layered
Ecumenopolis or even Matrioshka World setup

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.609
we sometimes contemplate as Earth’s eventual
fate.

00:30:25.609 --> 00:30:32.379
So we build down, down in craters and lavatubes,
deep into their rim walls too, and slowly

00:30:32.379 --> 00:30:39.179
as population rises we build deeper and wider,
and merge. All at the same time you’re piling

00:30:39.179 --> 00:30:44.769
on new layers above, making the whole world
structure more artificial and sturdy, and

00:30:44.769 --> 00:30:50.289
potentially bringing in cheap mass from elsewhere,
be it liquid hydrogen or helium or black holes,

00:30:50.289 --> 00:30:55.710
to add mass, if you want to.
How many people could comfortably fit in the

00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:00.859
Moon if we made it a three-dimensional city?
Tricky question as we always have the fuel,

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:05.659
food, and heat issues, not to mention as you
hollow it out to make homes, that excess material

00:31:05.659 --> 00:31:12.450
can be used to make more homes on higher levels.
It’s current volume is 22 x 10^18 cubic

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:18.570
meters, or 22 billion-billion, and the typical
apartment might be as little as 220 cubic

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.880
meters and hardly uncomfortably tiny, at that,
so that you could squeeze in 100 million,

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:28.610
billion people, a number that even a Dyson
Swarm would find respectable, but in truth

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:33.779
more the sort of number we would expect as
the upper end for an entire CisLunar or Earth

00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:39.330
Hill Sphere Planet Swarm, see our episode
on Colonizing CisLunar Space for more explanation

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.869
of that.
We’re not really contemplating packing people

00:31:42.869 --> 00:31:47.179
in to endless apartments on the Moon anyway,
but would probably instead use a figure more

00:31:47.179 --> 00:31:51.889
like 10 trillion, as it represents the high
upper end of what the Moon could get rid of

00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:57.070
as heat, even if rather expanded in radius,
from many layers or radiating super-towers

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:02.749
being added, while still giving its people
on the order of 10 kilowatts a piece for comfort,

00:32:02.749 --> 00:32:07.649
hydroponic food production, commerce, etc.
You could go higher in energy needs for fewer

00:32:07.649 --> 00:32:13.059
people or lower maybe, especially if the people
are getting pretty post-human like cyborgs

00:32:13.059 --> 00:32:18.509
or digital uploads, but let’s settle to
10 trillion. If we optimistically assumed

00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:23.239
10% of the human population lived on the Moon
at that point and the human population grew

00:32:23.239 --> 00:32:28.419
like it did in the 20th century or the last
20 years, doubling twice a century, then that

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:34.389
human population of 100 trillion might be
reached in as little as 8 or 9 centuries,

00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:39.210
near the dawn of the fourth millennium.
And personally I would have a hard time imagining

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:43.979
a terraforming project that might take many
more millennia to make the Moon blue and green

00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:49.080
would be allowed to override those efforts
and expansions, so that at most, the world

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.629
surface might look that way, covered in garden
domes, super-spire buildings, and spaceports,

00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:59.269
while the juggernaut lay below.
Now it’s popular in science fiction to portray

00:32:59.269 --> 00:33:05.489
Mars as some giant empire breakaway from earth,
like the US is often seen as being for Europe.

00:33:05.489 --> 00:33:11.019
Or even as dual empires of roughly equal footing,
such as we see in The Expanse or the Warhammer

00:33:11.019 --> 00:33:16.299
40,000 settings, and usually, if the Moon
is mentioned at all it’s as the footnote

00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:21.950
or, perhaps properly, as a small satellite
power. But in truth the Moon’s role in the

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:26.989
future is likely to be bigger and brighter
than Mars. If any world is likely to ever

00:33:26.989 --> 00:33:33.220
rival Earth or even come near it, it will
be our own Moon, not Venus or Mars or some

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:38.470
world around Alpha Centauri. It may make itself
mighty by slowly extracting matter to build

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:44.070
itself and its economy, fueling the push to
develop a vast solar empire and a vast collection

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:49.720
of industry and habitats in CisLunar Space,
all while importing cheap matter, such as

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.320
hydrogen or helium, to increase itself in
mass.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.749
Here though we see an option where the Moon
might rise to be a true double planet to earth,

00:33:58.749 --> 00:34:09.060
its twin and peer as we settle the solar system
and galaxy beyond.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:13.840
So we have a few announcements and our upcoming
schedule for April to get too, but first,

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.419
we were doing some math today to calculate
how big a black hole needed to be to emulate

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:23.480
Earth-like gravity on the Moon and we do try
to keep how much math we do during an episode

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.980
on the light side. Watching science videos
like ours is a great way to get an overview

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.520
and learn the basics of different topics,
but to gain an understanding of “why”

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.490
and “how” concepts work the way they do,
you have to try it yourself, and for that,

00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:42.260
I recommend heading over to Brilliant, today’s
sponsor.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.830
Brilliant is an interactive STEM-learning
platform that helps you to truly understand

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:51.659
concepts in math, science, and computer science
by guiding you through engaging, hands-on

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.550
courses.
Now a lot of folks who watch the show love

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:59.480
our topics but think of themselves as bad
at math, and they’d love to know more but

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.510
don’t think they can. Many of us learned
there was only one “right way” to approach

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:09.250
things like math, but in Brilliant’s new
Everyday Math course, that’s not the case.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:12.910
Exercises like finding the areas of shapes
will show you that there are many ways to

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:18.020
solve a problem, and the visual and interactive
solutions will help you understand the concepts

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.530
even better.
And don’t worry if you’re busy—lessons

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:26.450
are presented in bite-sized pieces, so you
can learn at your own pace in a no-pressure

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:32.520
environment. To get started for free, visit
brilliant.org/isaacarthur or click on the

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:37.610
link in the description, and the first 200
of you will get 20% off Brilliant's annual

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.850
premium subscription.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.990
So this is the first episode I’ve produced
since I got back from my trip to Santa Monica

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:50.240
to speak at the Rand Corporation's US-Japan
Space Cooperation Conference about 2 weeks

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.360
before this airs. The conference was a lot
of fun and dinner at the Japanese Consulate

00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:00.541
afterward was spectacular in cuisine, conversation,
and courtesy. I think I came up with a dozen

00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:04.510
different episode ideas while listening and
chatting with others, particularly Pete Worden

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:09.540
from Breakthrough Starshot. The man’s a
legend and he deserves the status.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.950
The opening keynote on Day 1 was David Kipping,
who a lot of you know from the Cool Worlds

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:18.220
Lab and Channel, and we ended up chatting
for a couple hours afterward while burning

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.660
time for our flights home and for everyone
who's watched his channel, yes he is every

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.910
bit as insightful and pleasant to talk to
as you’d expect. If you haven’t seen his

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:32.981
show, and especially if you’re a Fermi Paradox
fan, check out his episode “The First Civilization

00:36:32.981 --> 00:36:38.160
to Emerge in the Galaxy”, his narrative
on that episode is spellbinding, and don’t

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.840
forget to hit the like and subscribe button
while you’re there.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.980
Speaking of fellow science creators and on
a sadder note, I also wanted to express the

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:51.500
condolences of myself and the SFIA team to
Anton Petrov on the recent loss of his baby

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:57.600
boy Neil Apollo Petrov. I can't imagine anything
worse than that and since I know we share

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.710
a lot of audience, I’d just ask everyone
to continue to give him your kind words and

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:06.230
support during this hard time.
It’s been a rough couple months for many

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:11.240
folks on the back of what seems to be just
a brutal last couple years of virus-driven,

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.150
emotional-grinding change and hardship, and
I try not to sugar coat how hard times can

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:20.710
be on this show even though we aim for an
optimistic tone and I do believe in a brighter

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:26.980
future if we work hard for it. Stormy weather
brings the rain that makes the flowers grow

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:32.220
and there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.
Admittedly sometimes it feels like the light

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:37.390
at the end of the tunnel is actually a freight
train getting ready to run you over. I’ve

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:41.480
a feeling that this is going to continue to
be one of those kind of years, and its important

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:47.830
to stay strong, keep to your courage and convictions,
and just keep working to a better world, and

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.570
not to let events weigh your head down so
much you forget to see the good moments along

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:54.870
the trip too.
There is a lot of future to look forward to

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:59.860
as well, and we’d best get to it by finishing
up our schedule of episodes so we can finish

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:05.640
up this episode. We’re almost finished with
March too and we’ll close it out this weekend

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.920
with our Livestream Q&amp;A followed by a look
at Programmable and Smart Matter on March

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:16.480
31st. Then we’ll open up April with a look
at the concept of Self-Growing Space Habitats

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:22.900
and Bases. After that we have our scifi sunday
episode, Multi-Species Empires, followed by

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.220
asking what would happen if Earth lost the
sun and became a rogue planet?

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:32.570
