#03_CHARACTER 

> **03 CHARACTER** - A character refers to an individual or entity that is part of the story and plays a role in advancing the narrative. Characters are the driving force behind the events, conflicts, and emotions that unfold in the fictional world. They can be human, non-human (such as animals or supernatural beings), or even inanimate objects (personified entities). Each character possesses unique traits, personalities, motivations, and backgrounds that contribute to their distinct role within the story.

**Character is not created in isolation or repose; it’s forged through *interaction with others and the world.*** - STENDHAL

# Character - Body of Knowledge

### 030001_MCKEE - Character The Art of Role and Cast Design for Page, Stage, and Screen
McKee's entire methodology and theory when it comes to intertextual storytelling is based on the concept of duality. The idea of polar opposites are what govern drama, dilemma, and tragedy. The impossible decisions, contradictions, perceptions that we embody as consciousnesses against the immovable reality of the world in which we are forced adapt and change with. 
*The genius of McKee is in the simplicity of his design theory. **Duality** and the infinite spectrum between provides constraints to the infinity that is relentless creativity. At any point of the creative writing process, McKee is the tool to always reach for first. Salt to culinary.*

### 030002_HOWARD - Creating Characters 
Lauther's character theory aligns with contemporary understanding. In his view, character resembles a database form where every aspect, when completed, results in a fully developed character. Lauther's approach is straightforward, making it valuable for designing characters across different artistic forms.
*I find Lauther's approach particularly effective for adapting intricate characters across different media. Although its design is uncomplicated, it incorporates depth, enabling a seamless transition of characters from literary to visual formats.*

### 030003_WRITER'S DIGEST - Creating Characters
A compilation of insights from fiction authors on character development. This is invaluable for obtaining unique and nuanced perspectives on character, insights that can only be gleaned through years of experience. It's also beneficial as a resource to reinforce certain established, sometimes clichéd, principles—*principles that are meant to be reimagined, critiqued, or presented in opposition.*

### 030004_RIB - Creating Compelling Characters for Film, TV, Theatre and Radio
Davis explicitly states that his writings are not of a prescriptive nature. EG: Steps to character. Rather, Davis theorizes on the nature of character and characterization. He believes that character is an organism of evolving relationships that can adapt according to the needs of the author. What has worked, why, and why it might not again. He places the onus of decision making on the author. Concisely, Davis' approach to character is that of a craft. A pursuit of aesthetics guided by principles and refinement. 
*Davis is the wind in the sails and the stars in the sky. When all else fails, his pontifications can be used as a troubleshooting guide or a reminder that as the author, I decide write and wrong.*

### 030005_CORBETT - The Art of Character 
Corbett focuses on a wholistic approach of characterization that prioritizes the use of memory thru scenes. He breaks up the development of character into three steps: 
	- 1 conception
	- 2 development
	- 3 portrayal
*Corbett provides a solid theory, architecture, and method for developing character. For now, it seems that his approach will serve as the cornerstone in which all others will fall under*

### 030006_CORBETT - The Compass of Character
Corbett picks up with where The Art of Character leaves off, focusing wholly on the most important part of his character theory, motivation and desire. 
*The Art of Character, and The Compass of Character together is a solid theory and methodology of Character. Corbett, in general, should be thought of the most important of all character cornerstones because his theory serves as a bridge  between theory and practice.*

### 030007_SMITH - The Psychology Workbook for Writers 
Smith focuses on an academic psychological approach using applied theories used in counselling. Her approach designates *personality*, *human interaction*, *conflict*, and *self-sabotage*, as key identifiers for well developed characters. 
*Smith provides a very practical methodology that is backed up by science and experience. Its primary strength is its theoretical framework of establishing trauma in theory. Using Smith can help reinforce characterization in line with Corbett. 
Since Corbett focuses on scenic depth that is experienced by the reader, perhaps Smith can assist in creating a framework for the author to audit or verify the believability of a character's arch.*
