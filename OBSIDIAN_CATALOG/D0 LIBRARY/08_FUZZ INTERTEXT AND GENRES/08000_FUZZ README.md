> **08_FUZZ** *(Fuzzy Classifier)* - In the context of genre classification, a "fuzzy classifier" refers to a system that categorizes works not based on rigid, defined boundaries, but rather on a continuum of characteristics and traits that might overlap across various genres. This approach recognizes the fluid nature of genres, where a piece of work can possess elements of multiple genres simultaneously, allowing for a more nuanced categorization. This way, the fuzzy classifier accommodates the complexity and diversity found in literature, possibly providing a more rounded view of a work's stylistic and thematic composition.

### 005_Dramatic Storytelling & Narrative Design - BERGER, ROSS
An interesting introduction to Transmedia in the realm of Video Games. What I Wanted to glean from this book is how transmedia can be applied to literature. The most important takes from this book are the broadest of strokes. 
*I believe the best lessons I learned from this is to prepare for growth by having good documentation. Good documentation IE: an Obsidian notebook with the development notes available to those in different industries. This will empower those in other industries to understand the meat under the bikini so to speak.*
