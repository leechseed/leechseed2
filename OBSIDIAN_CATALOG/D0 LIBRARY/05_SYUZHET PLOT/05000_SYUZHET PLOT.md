| Syuzhet | In Narratology, 'syuzhet' refers to the way a story is organized and presented to the reader or audience. It is the narrative structure or arrangement of events as they appear in the actual telling of the story. This is distinct from 'fabula', which represents the chronological sequence of events in the story's world. 'Syuzhet' involves the manipulation of time, perspective, and information to create narrative interest and meaning. |
