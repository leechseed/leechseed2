# The Limits of Design: Kitchen Sink Design

**Summary: Game Design - The Challenge of Worldbuilding in RPGs**

- **Scope and Limitations**
  - Game design is constrained by page count, budget, and time.
  - Objective: Provide rich, inspiring content within these limits, without fully describing a world.

- **Common Approaches**
  - Two primary methods in game design to address this challenge.
  
- **Kitchen Sink Design (KSD)**
  - KSD attempts to cater to all possible player preferences.
  - Features multiple player races, terrains, cultures, etc., to cover various subgenres and interests.
  - Often results in "feature creep" and lack of focus.
  - Initially pleases a broad audience but lacks depth in specific areas.

- **Why KSD Succeeds Temporarily**
  - KSD attracts a large audience by offering something for everyone.
  - Enables publishers to create numerous game supplements.
  - However, it can lead to community dissatisfaction and overwhelming content.

- **The Downfall of KSD**
  - KSD leads to a lack of coherence and depth in the game world.
  - Overemphasis on variety over quality.
  - Eventually, the setting becomes too cumbersome for new players.

- **Focused Worldbuilding**
  - Emphasizes key areas of the game world for detailed development.
  - Aims for coherent, engaging content over volume.
  - More manageable for both new players and long-term fans.
  - Avoids overwhelming players with excessive information.

- **Resetting the World**
  - Publishers often reset or revise worlds to maintain accessibility.
  - Risks alienating fans attached to the original version.
  - Balances between keeping the world fresh and respecting core elements.

- **Key Idea**
  - Effective game design balances detailed, focused worldbuilding with the need to appeal to a diverse audience, avoiding the pitfalls of overwhelming and incoherent content.

**Summary: Balancing Worldbuilding in RPG Design**

- **Contrasting Approaches to RPG Worldbuilding**
  - The 'kitchen sink' approach includes diverse elements to appeal broadly.
  - 'Fire-and-forget' or 'limited canon' represents a more focused, limited approach.

- **Indie and Story Game Approach**
  - Indie RPGs often use a 'limited canon' model with self-contained, brief settings.
  - Focus on concise storytelling over expansive worldbuilding.

- **Midgard Solution**
  - Midgard avoids 'kitchen sink' pitfalls by emphasizing seven major regions with focused themes.
  - It limits the presence of certain races and gods to maintain thematic coherence.
  - The design aims for richness without needing extensive supplements.

- **Rationale Behind Focused Worldbuilding**
  - Focused worlds are more accessible, avoiding overwhelming new players.
  - It's a creative decision to keep the setting engaging and manageable.

- **Indie and Story Focus**
  - Indie games offer a counterbalance to sprawling worlds, focusing on specific stories and settings.
  - These games are often concise, with limited character options and specific narrative themes.

- **Conclusion on Worldbuilding in RPGs**
  - Worldbuilding should be enjoyable but not overburdened with material.
  - The best worlds are memorable without requiring extensive background reading.
  - Game design should focus on crafting a coherent and engaging experience rather than catering to every possible interest.

- **Key Idea**
  - Effective RPG worldbuilding lies in striking a balance between providing a rich, focused setting and avoiding the complexity and overload of the 'kitchen sink' approach, ensuring accessibility and depth for players.
