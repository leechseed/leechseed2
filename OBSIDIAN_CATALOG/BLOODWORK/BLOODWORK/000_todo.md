- add dramatica to processed books
	- books about angels and demons
	- a prime character book
- fill out bidirectional linking with simple entries 
- add the idea about 'lines of fabula'
	- lines of fabula are different concepts that are aspects and depths to my fictional text 
	- we will track this thru a program similar to an excel spreadsheet or an endless whiteboard
	- but the idea is that we're able to track the evolution of elements as the script moves forward. 
- design of prose
	- process a book that is about suzyhyet that elaborates more on the concept of how prose dynamics works
- surrounding information to process
	- angels and demons
	- books that focus on 
		- you're gonna need a bigger story
		- genre specific tropes
			- romance
			- smut
			- vampires
			- young adult
- create a grand list or even a mind map that serves as a template for the grand timeline
## overall i believe the primary driving factor should be directed towards 1) filling in the bidirectional links 2) supporting them with associated literature. 3) efficiently processing books. 4) breaking down narratology
