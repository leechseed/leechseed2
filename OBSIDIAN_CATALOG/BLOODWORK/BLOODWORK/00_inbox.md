film about vampire that works in a medical testing center like quest diagnostics

dude is a seasoned vampire doing the bloodwork for a 16-17 year old girl. she is 'Riley'

basically he swoons poetically over the blood type of the girl. 

nearly looses his shit.
cut to a scene like sipping a blood bag in the toilet. 
connotations to masturbating

cut to a montage about this vampire doing the tireless work of being a blood nurse. 

one time will be with another girl, this time he's having difficulty finding the vein, until it 'flashes' and spurts into the vial. 

cut to him, more conext, he has a biker bag full of these bloodbags that get tossed around 

cut to bathroom again, he's in the stall, someone comes in 'get ur shit together Roger you sick fuck'

Roger is slurpin nervously on that bloodbag

Roger montages a couple piss tests
They all ask if they need to see their dick or strip
Roger says no
Happens a couple times

Then the last guy gives a cup that kind of sloshes around, 'my bad i kinda lost the whip there'

cut to roger having to deep clean the fucking restroom
note a uv light scene 

cut to roger hanging everything back in a broom closet. He squats and drinks another bag, someone else sneaks in, he doesn't mind. 

Its his co-witness. Basically all vampires must be in pairs, no matter what. 

Elinore. 

She snuck in and shut the door behind her. She grabbed for the blood bag and his dick at the same time. 'Trade?'

quippy argument between them. She says something along the lines of that sperm retention or something like that?

'you know i'm good for it. plus its just a sip'
'nasty, you ever clean your straw? what happened to the copper one i gave you. tastes better anyway. jesus'

cut to a covid escalation montage. 
all these masks, all these new people getting tested 

his bag starts out full and empties out

escalate the pressures of being in this lifestyle. 

show a scene where he procures the blood from another vampire who works at the hospital. 

escalate how the pandemic affected everything. 

the girl Riley shows up again, except this time she's a bit more nosferatu. He recognizes her and notices all the differences. 

The biggest one being the wounds on her arm. infected from overuse. 

roger goes to protest, but riley uses her sexual wiles to prevent him from getting help, however, roger sees this as a moment to prevent her from getting hurt. 

he takes her blood, but also notices the sexual wiles...basically a vibe in her puss and a camera out recording as a live stream 

he plays along like one would. and follows her out to the lobby where he sees her pimp, a lizard named 'Chester'





they stand on a steeple or something and look over the city of Cascade

'i'm done. yeah.' 


....later on they get really dressed up to meet a 'the blackseed' a cafe like blackdog. 

to get there they have to draw a blood rune on a mirror for the m to step thru.  On any mirror possible, but ideally you want a full length to step thru. 

Strange entrance ritual, 
they cauterize the wound before the entrance at the shrine of the original devil-saint patron 

they flame their thumb over a candle, like way too long, and then they melt some wax, and pose for a quick picture making sure they show their waxed thumb on the card, and take the polaroid, place wax seal on the picture. they wave it around  like the polaroid picture song

they place it at a prayer like bench with a lit candle. it shows the other members that are already there before them. 

**eventaullly they choose to go to a red auction where they basically bid on bodies to drink the blood out of**

Basically what happens here is that the Roger clan must be shamed as the weakest of pantheon. 

note, rule here is that vampires are simply repositories of the souls of previous vampires, their experiences, etc. each person who houses the repository must live until it reaches the expectation of the collective souls. basically a time to pokemon evolution. 

According to books on the demons, create a hierarchy. An accelerated way of evolving is for one of the clan to consume and kill the others in their cult. 

Roger sees Riley at the red auction. He can't believe it. He just saw her. 

Seeing her there convinces him to evolve the cult into her. 


after he kills the cult, he goes hunting for her. 

**what happens here is an arc where he has to hunt and find her**

once he catches her, he gives her the reason and the choice for being the progenator. basically the next one to inherit these traits. 

she accepts 


**rebirth**
this arc Riley wakes up in a giant bat cave in guano where she basically has to crawl out of this cave into the light. 

comedy horror calm down arc where she basically has to scavenge and survive and deal with the pain of being a vampire. Roger the cat is there to help when he wants. 

**she is witness to that one murder** of the camper van girl. this is a start of a side arc as well. 

**Delilah** is a (true crime thru-line) she follows the vampire murder of Jessica, the corpse that Riley sucks dry and leaves naked. 

**this is a strange arc where it will be delilah/Jessica's murder/the state of Jessica's body** this arc evolves over a longer focalization 


Here we learn the rules and roles of the world. The overall goal is to reach the Syuzet, basically the Oracle of the Matrix 

**Riley's personal journey** accepted a deal that she was not ready for. She must accept and kill the girl before if she wants cope with the pain. 

Other weaker ones find themselves as pain psychotics like these zombies. 

bloodlines propagate and expands but all are from a root


**this is a whole arc in itself**


**Delilah works for the lizards, aka the IRS, aka the **
