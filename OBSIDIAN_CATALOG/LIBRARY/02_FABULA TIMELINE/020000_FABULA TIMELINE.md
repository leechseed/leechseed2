02000_FABULA SPACETIME



> [!note] In narratology, the term "fabula" refers to the chronological sequence of events in a story. It includes all the events that are narrated and those inferred by the audience. The fabula is the raw material of a story, and it represents what actually happens in the narrative, regardless of how these events are presented in the plot.

title: Further Explination 

To explain further, narratology often distinguishes between the "fabula" and the "syuzhet" (or "plot"). The "fabula" is the series of events in the order they would occur in real life or in a chronological timeline. It's the story as it would be if you just listed out what happens from start to finish, without any artistic or narrative structuring.

In contrast, the "syuzhet" is how these events are organized and presented in the narrative itself. This can include things like flashbacks, flash-forwards, and other narrative devices that play with the chronological order of events. The syuzhet is about the storytelling technique, while the fabula is about the story itself.

For example, in a mystery novel, the fabula would include the actual crime, the investigation, and the solution, in the order they occurred in the story world. The syuzhet, however, might start with the discovery of the crime, then flash back to events leading up to it, and then return to the present to show the investigation and resolution.

This distinction is important in narratology as it helps to analyze how stories are constructed and how they impact the audience. It's a key concept in understanding narrative structure and the art of storytelling.
