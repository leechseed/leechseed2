## 5 Structure and Character

**Character and Characterization in Storytelling**

- **Character vs. Characterization Debate**:
  - Aristotle viewed story structure as primary and character as secondary.
  - The 19th century saw a shift towards character-driven stories.
  - The debate continues, but it's flawed as structure and character are inherently intertwined.

- **Understanding Character and Characterization**:
  - Characterization: Observable traits of a person, like age, personality, values, and lifestyle.
  - True Character: Revealed through choices made under pressure, indicating the person's essential nature.

- **Pressure and Character Revelation**:
  - The true character is exposed when individuals face challenging situations.
  - Examples include choices made during a crisis or moral dilemmas.
  - Actions under pressure contrast with the outer facade, revealing the person's core.

- **Importance of Contradiction in Storytelling**:
  - Effective storytelling involves characters whose true nature contradicts their outer characterization.
  - Predictable characters with matching inner and outer selves are uninteresting.
  - Contradictory characters, like James Bond, are more engaging.

- **Character Depth in Major vs. Minor Roles**:
  - Major characters require depth and hidden dimensions.
  - Minor characters may not need as much complexity.
  - Principal characters must have a core that contrasts with their outward appearance.

- **Key Idea**:
  In storytelling, the essence of a character is revealed not through their outward characteristics, but through their choices under pressure, exposing their true nature. This depth and contradiction between a character's appearance and their core decisions are crucial for engaging and meaningful narratives.

**Character Arc and Storytelling**

- **Debate on Structure vs. Character**:
  - Historical debate: Aristotle prioritized structure over character.
  - Modern perspective: Structure and character are intertwined and equally important.

- **Character and Characterization**:
  - Characterization: Observable qualities of a person.
  - True Character: Revealed through choices made under pressure, showing the person's essence.

- **Character Arc Development**:
  - Example: "The Verdict" shows Frank Galvin's transformation from a corrupt attorney to an ethical one.
  - Hamlet: His characterization starts as melancholic, but choices under pressure reveal intelligence and passion.

- **Structure and Character Functions**:
  - Structure's function: To pressure characters into revealing their true natures.
  - Character's function: To bring necessary qualities for making believable choices.

- **Interrelation of Structure and Character**:
  - Changing one aspect (event or character) inherently changes the other.
  - Reinventing either character or structure requires altering the other.

- **Importance of Climax in Character Development**:
  - Climax is pivotal for revealing and changing character.
  - The last act's climax must be the most satisfying and meaningful part of the story.

- **Creative Challenges in Climax Development**:
  - Designing the climax involves significant creative labor.
  - Climax must align with the protagonist's character for credibility.

- **Characterization Adjustments for Climax**:
  - Characterization may need to be adjusted to make the climax credible.
  - Example: "Greed" showcases characters making ultimate choices that define them.

- **Conclusion on Character Arc**:
  - The essence of storytelling lies in the dynamic interplay of character and structure.
  - Great stories feature character arcs that are intricately linked with the story's structure, leading to profound revelations and transformations.

- **Key Idea**:
  In storytelling, the true essence of a character is not just in their observable traits (characterization) but in their evolution and choices under pressure, intricately interwoven with the story's structure, culminating in a powerful climax that reveals and transforms their core nature.

## 6 Structure and Meaning

**Aesthetic Emotion and Storytelling**

- **The Essence of Storytelling**:
  - Artistic storytelling unites ideas and emotions, contrasting with life's separate experiences of thought and feeling.
  - Aesthetic emotion harmonizes knowledge with feelings, offering a heightened awareness of one's place in reality.

- **Premise vs. Controlling Idea**:

  - Controlling Idea: The story's ultimate meaning expressed in the action and emotion of the climax.

- **Role of Premise in Story Creation**:
  - Premises are personal, awakening the writer's unique visions or convictions.
  - The original premise can be abandoned if the story evolves in a different direction.

- **Structure as Rhetoric**:
  - Storytelling is the demonstration of truth through the creative process.
  - Ideas must be proved through the story's event structure, not merely explained.

- **Dramatization Over Explanation**:
  - Master storytellers rely on dramatization rather than explanation.
  - Audiences understand and believe ideas through the actions and consequences shown in the story.

- **Storytelling and Crime Genre Example**:
  - The idea "Crime doesn’t pay" is understood through the events of detective fiction, not through direct dialogue.
  - The emotional impact of justice and social revenge is felt in the climax, reflecting the story's core idea.

- **Variations in Aesthetic Emotion**:
  - Different genres strive for varying strengths of emotional effects.
  - Regardless of genre, a story's meaning must be dramatized emotionally, avoiding explanatory dialogue.

- **Key Idea**:
  Effective storytelling melds idea and emotion, using structure as a means to express and prove its central truth. This harmonization of thought and feeling in art provides meaningful emotional experiences that contrast with the often disjointed nature of real life experiences.

**Controlling Idea in Storytelling**

- **Defining Controlling Idea**:
  - A Controlling Idea is a coherent sentence expressing the story's irreducible meaning.
  - It guides the writer's choices and implies function in shaping the story strategically.

- **Components of a Controlling Idea**:
  - **Value**: Identifies the positive or negative charge of the story's critical value at the climax.
  - **Cause**: Determines the primary reason for the change in value.

- **Formation of Controlling Idea**:
  - Expressed in a sentence combining Value and Cause, describing the how and why of life's change in the story.
  - Examples include: "Justice triumphs because the protagonist is more violent than the criminals" (Crime genre).

- **Discovering Controlling Idea**:
  - Emerges from the story, particularly the climax, rather than being dictated by the writer.
  - Reflects a self-recognition in the writer, often revealing unexpected aspects of their inner self.

- **Idea vs. Counter-Idea in Story Progression**:
  - Story is shaped dynamically, alternating between positive and negative charges of the central values.
  - This creates a dialectical debate within the narrative, culminating in the victory of one voice as the Controlling Idea.

- **Key Idea**:
  The Controlling Idea in storytelling is a powerful tool that encapsulates the core meaning of a narrative, emerging from the dynamic interplay of values and causes within the story. It acts as a guiding principle, shaping the writer's decisions and ultimately reflecting deeper aspects of their perspective and identity.

1. **The Role of Irony in Storytelling**:
   - Irony combines idealism and pessimism, reflecting life's complexity.
   - It demands deep wisdom and craftsmanship from the writer.
   - Irony must be clear, motivated, and maintain a balance without canceling out positive and negative aspects.

2. **Entertainment and Meaning**:
   - All stories, regardless of genre, convey meaningful ideas within an emotional experience.
   - Storytelling is not just entertainment; it has the power to influence beliefs and values.
   - Plato warned about the power of storytellers to conceal ideas within art's emotions.

3. **Controlling Idea and Social Responsibility**:
   - A story's climax reveals its controlling idea, a clear statement of its core meaning.
   - Writers must respect their story's controlling idea and recognize its influence on audiences.

# Part 3 The Principles of Story Design

## 7 The Substance of Story

**Exploring the Substance and Dynamics of Storytelling**

1. **Nature of Storytelling Substance**:
   - The essence of story is intangible, existing beyond mere language.
   - Storytelling involves a deeper substance than words, requiring a subjective and imaginative approach.

2. **Characteristics of the Protagonist**:
   - The protagonist is typically a single character but can be a duo, trio, or a group (Plural-Protagonist) with shared desires and consequences.
   - A Multiprotagonist narrative weaves separate stories, each with its protagonist.
   - Protagonists can be human, animal, animated, or even inanimate entities.

3. **Qualities of the Protagonist**:
   - **Willpower**: A protagonist is defined by a strong will, essential for driving the story.
   - **Conscious Desire**: Protagonists have clear, conscious objectives or goals.
   - **Unconscious Desire**: Complex protagonists often have a subconscious desire in contrast to their conscious one.
   - **Appropriate Capacities**: The protagonist must have believable qualities to pursue their desire convincingly.
   - **Possibility of Attainment**: Protagonists should have at least a minimal chance of fulfilling their desires, reflecting the universal human trait of hope.

4. **Key Idea**:
   Storytelling transcends language, hinging on a deeper, living substance felt and experienced subjectively. The protagonist, central to this narrative, embodies various facets of character, from willpower to conscious and subconscious desires. These elements, combined with an appropriate capacity for action and the inherent hope of achieving their desires, shape the storytelling journey and engage the audience in a profound, emotional experience.

**Understanding Protagonists and Audience Engagement in Storytelling**

1. **Protagonist's Journey and Limitations**:
   - Protagonists possess willpower and the capacity to pursue their desires to the human limit defined by the story's setting and genre.
   - Stories must conclude with a final action that leaves no further questions or possibilities, reaching the 'end of the line'.

2. **Essential Protagonist Qualities**:
   - **Will and Desire**: The protagonist is characterized by strong will and known desires, either conscious or unconscious.
   - **Capacity for Pursuit**: Must have believable qualities to convincingly pursue their desires.
   - **Potential for Attainment**: The protagonist should realistically have a chance of fulfilling their desires.

3. **Empathy vs. Sympathy in Protagonists**:
   - Empathy is crucial, meaning the audience must see something of themselves in the protagonist.
   - Sympathy (likability) is optional and less critical than empathy for audience engagement.

4. **Audience Bond with the Protagonist**:
   - The bond is maintained through empathetic connections, where the audience sees shared human qualities.
   - Empathy allows audiences to root for the protagonist’s desires, as these mirror their own aspirations.

5. **Creating Empathetic Characters**:
   - Even unsympathetic characters can be made empathetic by revealing a shared human trait, like a conscience.
   - Effective storytelling finds empathetic centers in complex characters, facilitating a deeper audience connection.

6. **Starting the Storytelling Process**:
   - Characters in a story will always take the minimum, conservative action from their perspective.
   - What is considered 'conservative' or 'minimal' action varies based on each character’s viewpoint and situation.

7. **Key Idea**:
   Crafting a compelling story hinges on creating a protagonist with whom the audience can empathize. This connection is not necessarily about likability but about finding a common thread of humanity that resonates with the audience, compelling them to invest emotionally in the character’s journey. Storytelling, therefore, becomes an exploration of these deep, empathetic bonds, where characters' actions are driven by their conservative nature relative to their unique perspectives.

![[Pasted image 20231217074407.png]]

**Exploring Character Dynamics and the Essence of Storytelling**

1. **Character's Internal and External Worlds**:
   - Characters act based on their internal perceptions and expectations, often clashing with the external world's reactions.
   - The protagonist's inner world includes self-conflicts arising from their mind, body, and emotions.
   - External world encompasses personal relationships and extra-personal conflicts like societal institutions and the environment.

2. **The Concept of 'The Gap' in Storytelling**:
   - Stories emerge from the gap between a character's subjective expectations and the objective outcomes of their actions.
   - This gap reveals the difference between what characters believe will happen and what actually happens in response to their actions.

3. **The Interaction of Probability and Necessity**:
   - Characters operate based on their sense of probability, influenced by their past experiences and perceptions.
   - Necessity represents the absolute truth or reality that unfolds as a result of their actions.

4. **Character Responses to Conflict and Gap**:
   - When confronted with the gap, characters are compelled to take riskier, more significant actions, moving beyond conservative approaches.
   - These intensified actions result from the character's increased willingness to risk in pursuit of their desires.

5. **Importance of Will and Capacity in Characters**:
   - Characters must have the will and capacity to navigate through the gap and address the challenges they face.
   - The story's depth and engagement hinge on the character's ability to confront and adapt to these emerging realities.

6. **Key Idea**:
   Effective storytelling hinges on a deep understanding of the protagonist's internal world and how it conflicts with external reality. The crux of engaging narratives lies in the 'gap' that emerges between characters' expectations and the actual outcomes of their actions. This gap, bridged by the characters' willpower and capacity for risk, forms the foundation of compelling storytelling, illustrating the intricate dance between subjective probability and objective necessity.

![[Pasted image 20231217074524.png]]

**Understanding Risk and Progression in Storytelling**

1. **The Essence of Risk in Storytelling**:
   - Risk is central to engaging storytelling; the protagonist must risk something valuable for their desire.
   - The severity of potential loss if the protagonist fails is a measure of a story's depth and engagement.
   - Stories lacking significant risk are fundamentally flawed, leading to uninteresting narratives.

2. **Risk as a Reflection of Meaningful Life**:
   - The value of a desire in a story is proportionate to the risk involved in pursuing it.
   - Risk in storytelling mirrors the human pursuit of a meaningful life, characterized by perpetual risk-taking.

3. **Writer's Personal Risks Mirrored in Characters**:
   - Writers inherently risk time, money, and personal relationships in pursuit of their craft.
   - These personal risks reflect the types of risks characters in stories should also be willing to take.
   - The depth of a character's desire is shown by the willingness to risk important aspects of life.

4. **The Gap in Story Progression**:
   - A protagonist's actions often lead to unexpected consequences, creating a gap between expectation and reality.
   - This gap forces the character to constantly reassess and adapt, taking increasingly risky actions.
   - Each action and its consequent gap deepen the character's conflict and investment in their goal.

5. **Key Idea**:
Effective storytelling hinges on the protagonist's willingness to take significant risks, reflecting the pursuit of meaningful life. This risk is exemplified in the gap between a character's expectations and the reality of their actions, driving a compelling narrative progression. The writer's personal sacrifices in crafting a story parallel the risks that characters must take within the narrative, underscoring the intrinsic connection between life's risks and the essence of storytelling.


**Exploring the Depths of Character in "Chinatown"**

1. **Core Principles of Character Behavior**:
   - Characters act based on their perception of the most conservative and minimal action required to achieve their goals.
   - In stories, unlike in life, characters' actions often provoke unexpected and significant reactions from their world.
   - The gap between expectation and reality in characters' actions is what makes storytelling dynamic and engaging.

2. **The Need for Risk in Storytelling**:
   - Characters must risk something significant for their goals, reflecting the value of their desires.
   - The greater the risk, the more compelling the story, mirroring the human pursuit of meaningful existence.
   - Lack of substantial risk leads to uninteresting narratives.

3. **Inside-Out Approach to Writing Characters**:
   - Writers must inhabit their characters' perspectives to create emotional truth.
   - Asking "If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?" helps achieve genuine character emotions.
   - Empathy is crucial; writers must feel what their characters feel to convey authentic experiences.

4. **Case Study: "Chinatown"**:
   - J.J. Gittes: A private detective with a complex background, driven by pride, justice, and an idealistic nature.
   - Evelyn Mulwray: A secretive, nervous woman entangled in her husband's murder, struggling to hide a crucial secret.

   - Katherine: A sheltered and obedient character, caught in the midst of unfolding events.

5. **Key Idea**:
"Chinatown" exemplifies the importance of deep character exploration in storytelling. Characters must be crafted with a keen understanding of their motivations, perceptions, and the risks they are willing to take. The emotional authenticity of a story hinges on a writer's ability to fully embody and empathize with their characters, ensuring that their actions and reactions resonate with genuine human experience.

**Understanding Story Dynamics: The Gap in "Chinatown"**

1. **The Substance of Story:**
   - Storytelling thrives on the unexpected: the gap between a character's actions and the unanticipated reactions of the world.
   - This gap creates a dynamic, engaging narrative, distinguishing between mere activity and significant action.
   - The essence of story lies in these moments of contradiction, where expectation clashes with reality.

2. **The Role of Risk and Jeopardy:**
   - Compelling stories involve characters risking significant aspects of their lives for their desires.
   - The value of a character's desire is measured by the risks they are willing to take, reflecting the pursuit of meaningful existence.
   - Lack of significant risk results in unengaging narratives.

3. **Writing from the Inside Out:**
   - Emotional authenticity in storytelling is achieved by inhabiting the character's perspective.
   - Writers must ask, "If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?" to find genuine character reactions.
   - The process involves acting out characters, shifting between various perspectives to create insightful reactions.

4. **"Chinatown" as a Case Study:**
   - The scene's tension arises from the characters' conflicting objectives and surprising revelations.
   - Gittes' pursuit of truth and Evelyn's secret create a compelling dynamic, with each action opening new gaps in expectation.
   - The scene exemplifies the importance of unexpected reactions in driving the story forward.

5. **The Energy of Story:**
   - The gap between action and reaction is the source of energy in a story, creating emotional involvement for the audience.
   - Audiences empathize with characters, experiencing the same surprise and energy as the narrative unfolds.
   - The power of storytelling lies in bridging these gaps, igniting the audience's emotions and insights.

6. **Key Idea:**
"The essence and energy of a compelling story reside in the gap between a character's actions and the world's unexpected reactions. This dynamic, exemplified in 'Chinatown,' creates a narrative that engages and moves the audience, demonstrating the importance of risk, emotional authenticity, and the power of unanticipated outcomes in storytelling."
