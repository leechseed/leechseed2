| **Parafictive Mizzenput** | This theoretical framework addresses the complex interplay between fictional narratives and reader perception, focusing on phenomena where readers project, misinterpret, or over-identify with fictional content, leading to behaviors ranging from constructive engagement to maladaptive responses.                               |
| **Parafictive Overreach** | This occurs when readers attribute unrealistic expectations or significance to fictional narratives, such as seeking prophetic wisdom or personal salvation. It often manifests as a protective, obsessive attachment to the narrative, sometimes leading to infantile and destructive coping mechanisms.                     |
| **Parafictive Dissonance** | This term describes the tendency to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality, appropriating the narrative for personal lived experience rather than engaging in shared interpretation and discussion. It contrasts the clear delineation of fiction and reality, focusing on immersive interpretation and analysis. |
| **Parafictive Malbehavior** | Characterized by seeking validation or identity in an almost addictive manner, this behavior often results in the formation of cult-like fan communities. It mirrors a collective, anarchic struggle for identity and boundary-setting, reminiscent of historical sociological upheavals.                                 |

### Character Categorization and Determination in Narratives

- **Resisting Simplistic Character Classifications**
  - Traditional classifications like E.M. Forster's "<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">round</mark>" and "<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">flat</mark>" characters are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">limited and exclude diverse narrative genres</mark>.
  - Such categories often fail to appreciate the complexity of characters in non-psychological narratives, like fairy tales or ancient literature.

- **Character Construction and Reader Interpretation**
  - Characters are constructed from various narrative elements, influencing reader perception and predictability.
  - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">External knowledge and personal context of readers affect character interpretation, creating unique understandings.</mark>

- **The Influence of Real-World Context on Characters**
  - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Real-world knowledge impacts character perception, as seen in historical or legendary figures in narratives.</mark>
  - Readers' preconceived notions of these figures clash or align with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">narrative portrayal</mark>, affecting character understanding.

- **Character Behavior and Reader Expectations**
  - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Referential characters</mark> (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">historical</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mythical</mark>) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must align with general expectations to maintain identity within the narrative.</mark>
  - Deviations from expected behaviors can create surprise or humor, enhancing narrative engagement.

- **Misinterpretation of Characters and Psychoanalytic Criticism**
  - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Misinterpretation of characters can occur when readers project real-world psychology onto fictional characters.</mark>
  - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Psychoanalytic criticism</mark> should focus on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">textual effects</mark> on readers, not on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">diagnosing fictional characters</mark>.

- **Key Idea:**
  - In narrative texts, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">character categorization</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">determination</mark> are complex processes influenced by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reader's pre-existing knowledge</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">external context</mark>, and the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">narrative's presentation</mark>. Understanding characters requires recognizing them as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fictional constructs</mark> influenced by various narrative elements and resisting the urge to oversimplify or misinterpret them based on real-world psychology or stereotypes.
