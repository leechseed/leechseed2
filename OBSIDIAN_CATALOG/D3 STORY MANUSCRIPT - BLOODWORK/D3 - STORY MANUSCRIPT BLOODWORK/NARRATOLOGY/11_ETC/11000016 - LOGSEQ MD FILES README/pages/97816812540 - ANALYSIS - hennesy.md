		- ## CHAPTER 2: Viewpoints on Reading Comprehension
		  collapsed:: true
			- **The Ultimate Goal of Reading Comprehension** - for the reader to reconstruct the mental world of the writer.
			- ### CONNECTING READING COMPREHENSION RESEARCH TO THE CLASSROOM
			- ### READING COMPREHENSION DEFINED; PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS
				- **Comprehension** - a process, a series of actions, or operations that are necessary to complete to construct meaning.
			- ### COMPREHENSION PROCESS
				- ### Language Process
					- **The Process of Reading Comprehension** - involves two processes: the language process and the cognitive process.
					- **Language Process** - a multi-level process that involves the word level, the sentence level, and the background knowledge level.
					- **Language Process Word Level** - The process in which a reader must decode individual words to access their meaning.
					- **Language Process Sentence Level** - The process in which the reader needs to work out the syntactic structure and sense of each sentence.
				- ### Cognitive Process
					- **Microstructure and Macrostructure** - two basic levels of cognitive processing involved in how readers construct and integrate meaning.
					- **Microstructure** - the surface code of the text; the exact words and sentences (syntax) chosen by the author to convey meaning.
					- **Word Meanings** - words and their meanings combined to create 'idea units' within the text.
					- **Idea Units** - words and their meanings connected at the sentence level through semantic and syntactic relationships.
					- **Macrostructure** - a hierarchy of idea units that contribute to the overall structure of the text.
					- **The Textbase** - connected sentences and paragraphs coupled with the underlying meanings of the text, which add up to the topic or theme of the text.
					- **Proficient Readers** - a type of reader that can construct an integrated meaning rather than an exact record of specific words, syntax, or structure.
					- **Irwin's Model** - a model that describes five basic cognitive subprocesses that work simultaneously and complement one another as the reader constructs a mental model.
						- **Irwin's Microprocesses** - Identifying and making meaning of idea units
						- **Integrative Processes** - Integrating ideas between sentences
						- **Metacognitive Processes** - Monitoring understanding
						- **Elaborative Processes** - integrating prior knowledge and inferencing
						- **Macroprocesses** - Organizing overall understanding
			- ### THE ROLE OF THE READER, THE TEXT, THE TASK, AND THE CONTEXT
				- **Making of Meaning** - Occurs as the reader proceeds through the text within the conditions set by the text and the context
				- **Catherine Snow's Model** - Characterizes successful comprehension as what occurs when the demands of the text, the challenges of the task, and the skills and proclivities of the reader are well aligned.
				- ### The Reader
					- **The Reader** - brings his or her strengths and weaknesses to the assigned text and task.
					- **The Reader Works with the Text** - the reader needs a breadth and depth of vocabulary knowledge as well as knowledge of how to use context and morphology to determine word meaning.
					- **Discourse Structures** - to anticipate, organize, and store information, based on the text.
				- ### The Text
					- **Academic Language** - words and syntactic structures that readers are not likely to encounter in everyday, spoken English.
					- **Text Difficulty** - A level that is observed based on the function of vocabulary load, coherence, linguistic structure, discourse style, and genre.
					- **Coh-Matrix** - An automated measure of cohesion that is designed to analyze texts on multiple levels to ultimately create a level of relative text difficulty.
				- ### The Task
					- **Reader's Motivation** - The reader reads for one of three reasons: entertainment, knowledge, or application.
				- ### The Context
					- **The Broad Context of Reading** - involves sociocultural factors, school experience, neighborhood surroundings, etc.

		- ## CHAPTER 8: The Blueprint for Levels of Understanding and Inference
			- ### LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING
			  id:: a711b86e-c0fa-4602-8ddc-24e4ca35fe6d
				- **Levels of Understanding** - the relationship among the following; language and cognitive processes and skills, the surface code of the text, the underlying textbase, and the construction of a mental situation model
				- ### Three Levels of Understanding
					- **Three Levels of Understanding** - 1) the surface code of the text, 2) the textbase, and 3) the construction of a mental model
					- **Level 1: The Surface Code** - the level represented by the exact words and syntax of the text used by the author, which is what readers immediately recall.
					- **Level 2: Making Meaning from the Textbase** - the level represented by recalling what is on the page via understanding the author's intended meaning
					- **Textbase Construction Process** - 1) how word meanings combine into idea units or propositions at the surface level; 2) how these units of meaning work in combination with each other to communicate the underlying meaning of the text
					- **Level 3: Constructing a Situation or Mental Model of the Text**- the level represented by using language and cognitive processes, including the use of inferences, to integrate successive units of meaning at the surface and textbase levels
					- **Mental Model** - the reader's overall understanding of the situation expressed in the text
				- ### The Role of Inference
			- ### CONNECTIONS TO READING COMPREHENSION
				- **Comprehension** - a complex, integrative, and constructive process.
				- **Construction of Meaning** - the reader's aggregating units of meaning that include textual information and related background knowledge
				- **Syntactic** - a reader's knowledge of word meaning and syntax
				- **Semantic** - relevant background knowledge the reader has determined has a relationship with word meaning
			- ### INFERENCE DEFINED
				- **Inference** - the identification of meaningful relations between the various parts of the text, and between those parts and the reader's background knowledge
			- ### NECESSARY INFERENCES: LOCAL AND GLOBAL COHERENCE
				- **Local Coherence Inferences** - integrating information from adjacent pieces of text
				- **Global Coherence Inferences** - a globally coherent representation of text meaning, for example inferences about themes, morals, and settings
				- **Textual Cohesiveness** - the measure of the reader's understanding how the ideas and relationships presented within the text work together and contribute to understanding
				- ### Local Coherence Inferences
					- **Syntactic Structure** -  a model which the reader integrates information from different sentences to build meaning; a requirement for local coherence inference
					- *__Cohesive Ties__*
						- **Cohesive Ties** - anaphoric devices, words or phrases that take their meaning from another part of the sentence or sentences (eg pronouns, repetition of a noun or phrase, substitution or synonym, ellipsis)
						- **Lexical Cohesion** - repetition of a noun or phrase or the use of substitution or synonyms
						- **Ellipsis**- anaphoric device that ties up the meaning of sentences, making the larger sections of text understandable
					- **Connectiveness**
						- **Connectives** - conjunctions and adverbs; words or phrases that signal logical relationships between parts of sentences; cuing specific types of relationships between events (causal, temporal)
						- **Additive Connectives** - indicates inclusive relationships expressing a condition of aggregation or emphasis of meaning by way of multiple idea units
						- **Temporal Connectives** - indicate sequence in time and include words such as *before, after, and while*
						- **Causal Connectives** - indicate cause-and-effect relationships, and adversatives
						- **Adversative Connectives** - indicates the expression of contrast in condition or a form of opposition
						- **Conditional Connectives** - indicates a logic gate where a relationship must meet certain conditions if not met results in a non-relationship (null status)
				- ### Global Coherence Inferences
					- **Global Coherence Inferences** - the reader's ability to gain access to active semantic knowledge networks
					- **Knowledge** - memory based meaningful connections organized  in a systemic manner among concepts, facts, ideas, and beliefs
					- **Motivated Inference** - reader's response to demands of the text and perceived task among several reasons: Understanding the cause of events, predicting future actions, identifying setting, identifying character's motives, beliefs, and traits, understanding character relationships, drawing conclusions, understanding author's view and/or biases
				- ### Facilitating Factors
					- *__Vocabulary and Knowledge__*
					- **Standards of Coherence**
						- **Coherence** - the way which text elements, including words, phrases, sentences, and the paragraph or passage as a whole, work together and contribute to constructing meaning
						- **Motivated Standards for Comprehension** - the reader sets his or her own goals for understanding (implicitly or explicitly) depending on the reading situation, which includes the reader's perception of the task, the demands of the text, and his or her abilities and attitudes
						- **Degree of Understanding** - a reader's minimum viable measure of comprehension to establish comprehension
						- *__Memory__*
							- **Long-Term Memory** - provides the reader with a storehouse of language-based information that can hopefully be easily accessed
							- **Short-Term Memory** - holds information just long enough so the reader can decide what is more relevant to the task
							- **Working-Memory**- preserving information a bit longer so the reader can engage in necessary processes, (knowledge, comprehension, coherence)
							- **Bridging Inferences**- idea units  (words, phrase, clauses) that reader must hold in memory to identify relationships within the immediate text structure
							- **Gap-Filling Inferences** - the reader's ability to easily gain access to background knowledge and integrating this information with the words and sentences presented by the author
							- **Working-Memory Capacity**- the measure of a reader's ability to meet the author's requirements of inferential understanding; the more literal the text, the less capacity is required; the more abstract the text, the more demanding for capacity
