- # PART 2 - THE ELEMENTS OF STORY
	- ## 2 THE STRUCTURE SPECTRUM
		- ### THE TERMINOLOGY OF STORY DESIGN
		- ### STRUCTURE
			- **Structure** - a selection of events from the characters' life stories that is composed into a strategic sequence to arouse specific emotions to express a specific view of life
			- **Event** - caused by or affects people, thus delineating characters; it takes place in a setting, generating image, action, and dialogue; it draws energy from conflict producing emotion in characters and audience alike.
			- **Design of Events** - needs a dual strategy
			- ### Event
				- **Event**- means change
				- **Story Event** - creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a Value and achieved through conflict
				- **Story Values** - the universal qualities of human experience that may shift from positive to negative, or negative to positive from one moment to the next
			- #### Beat
				- **Beat** - an exchange of behavior in action/reaction. Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene
			- #### Scene
				- **Scene** - an action through conflict in continuous time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character's life on at least one value with a degree of perceptible significance.
				- **Scene Evaluation** - What value is at stake in my character's life at the moment? How is the value charged at the top of the scene? How is that value charged at the end of the scene? If the value charged condition of the character's life stays unchanged from one end of the scene to the other, nothing meaningful happens
				- **The Ideal Scene**- No scene that doesn't turn
				- **Action Genres** - turn on public values such as freedom/slavery or justice/injustice
				- **Education Genre** - turns interior values such as self-awareness/self-deception or life as meaningful/meaningless
				- **The Universal Principle of Scene** - If a scene is not a true event, cut it
			- #### Sequence
				- **Sequence** - a series of scenes--generally two to five--that culminates with greater impact than any previous scene
			- #### Act
				- **Act** - a series of sequences that peaks in a climactic scene which uses a major reversal of values, more powerful than previous acts
			- #### Story
				- **Story** - a series of acts, the largest story structure
				- **Story Climax** - a story concept that  serves the purpose of absolute irreversible change
		- ### THE STORY TRIANGLE
			- **Plotting** - the writer's choice of events and their design in time
			- #### Archplot, Miniplot, Antiplot
				- **Classical Design** - a story built around an active protagonist who struggles against primarily external forces of antagonism to pursue his or her desire, through continuous time, within a consistent and causally connected fictional reality, to a closed ending of absolute irreversible change.
				- **Minimalism** - the writer reduces the elements of Classical Design--shrinking or compressing, trimming or truncating the prominent features of the Archplot
				- **Miniplot** - the set of compressed features found in minimalist plot design
				- **Antiplot**- the rejection of classical design
		- ### FORMAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE STORY TRIANGLE
			- **Closed Versus Open Endings**
				- **Closed Ending**- a Story Climax of absolute, irreversible change that answers all questions raised by the telling and satisfies all audience emotion
				- **Open Ending**- a Story Climax that leaves a question or two unanswered and some emotion unfulfilled
			- **External Versus Internal Conflict**
			- **Single Versus Multiple Protagonists**
				- **Classically Told Story** - a story in which a single protagonist--man, woman, or child--at the heart of the telling
			- **Active Versus Passive Protagonist**
				- **Active Protagonist** - in the pursuit of desire, takes action in direct conflict with the people and the world around him
				- **Passive Protagonist** - outwardly inactive while pursuing desire inwardly, in conflict with aspects of his or her own nature.
			- **Linear Versus Nonlinear Time**
				- **Linear Time**- a story with or without flashbacks and arranged into a temporal order of events that the audience can follow
				- **Nonlinear Time** - a story that either skips helter-skelter through time or so blurs temporal continuity that the audience cannot sort out what happens before and after what is told
			- **Causality Versus Coincidence**
				- **Causality** - drives a story in which motivated actions cause effects that in turn become the causes of yet other effects, thereby interlinking the various levels of conflict in a chain reaction of episodes to the Story Climax, expressing the interconnectedness of reality
				- **Coincidence** - drives a fictional world in which unmotivated actions trigger events that do not cause further effects, and therefore fragment the story into divergent episodes and an open ending, expressing the disconnectedness of existence.
			- **Consistent Versus Inconsistent Realities**
				- **Archplot**- a consistent reality in which plot evolves; a set of laws that cannot be broken regardless of rationality
				- **Consistent Realities** - fictional settings that establish modes of interaction between characters and their world that are kept consistently throughout the telling to create meaning
				- **Inconsistent Realities** - settings that mix modes of interaction so that the story's episodes jump inconsistently from one 'reality' to another to create  a sense of absurdity'
				- **Antiplot** - the opposite of an archplot, the only rule is to break the rules
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668426096046_0.png){:height 362, :width 414}
			- **Change Versus Stasis**
				- **Miniplot** - change that occurs in a character's deepest level of inner conflict
				- **Nonplot** - story dissolved into portraiture, either a portrait of verisimilitude or one of absurdity
		- ### THE POLITICS OF STORY DESIGN
			- #### The Writer Must Earn His Living Writing
				- **Most Humans Believe** - life brings closed experiences of absolute irreversible change; the greatest source of conflict are external to themselves; the main character is themselves and are the single and only active protagonist of their own existence; their existence operates through the continuous time within a consistent, casually interconnected reality; within the reality events happen for explainable and meaningful reasons
				- **Classical Design** - a model of memory and anticipation
			- #### The Writer Must Master Classical Form
				- **The History of Art** - a revolution of revivals: Establishment icons are shattered by avant-garde, in time becomes the new establishment, and is then shattered by another avant-garde similar to the original establishment
				- **Classical Anticipation** - The passive behavior in which humans universally express when encountering a story for the first time.
			- #### The Writer Must Believe in What He Writes
				- **Stanislavski** - every aspect of storytelling must be pursued with passionate conviction
				- **Edmund Husserl's Objective Correlative** - a story is the embodiment of our own ideas and passions; the feelings and insights we wish to instill in the audience
				- **McKee's Poetic Politic** - write only what you believe

			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669265531846_0.png)
		- ### THE QUEST
			- **the Quest**- the same tale, one way or another, since the dawn of humanity, told over and over again
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669265817626_0.png)
		- ### DESIGN OF THE INCITING INCIDENT
			- **The Causality Principle of the Inciting Incident** - the inciting incident can only occur in one or two ways: by decision or by coincidence
			- **Subpot Incident Rule** - each subplot must have an inciting incident
			- **Major Dramatic Question** - the question provoked in the mind of the reader when experiencing the inciting incident, 'how will this end?'
			- **Obligatory Scene (crisis)** - the scene that the audience knows must occur before the story can end
			- **Foreshadowing** - linking the Inciting Incident to the Obligatory scene
		- ### LOCATING THE INCITING INCIDENT
			- **25% Rule** - the first major event of the central plot occurs within the first 1/4 of the story's telling
			- **Central Plot Inciting Incident Timing Rule** - the  inciting incident must be brought into the story as soon as possible; if arrives too soon, the audience will be confused; if arrives too late; the audience will be bored
		- ### THE QUALITY OF THE INCITING INCIDENT
			- **Quality Assurance of Inciting Incident**
				- Does the Inciting Incident radically upset the balance of forces in the protagonist's life?
				- Does it arouse in the protagonist the desire to restore balance?
				- Does it inspire him the conscious desire for that object, material or immaterial, he feels would restore balance?
				- In a complex protagonist, does it also bring to life an unconscious desire that contradicts his conscious need?
				- Does it launch the protagonist on a quest for his desire?
				- Does it raise the Major Dramatic Question in the mind of the audience?
				- Does it project an image of the Obligatory Scene?
		- ### CREATING THE INCITING INCIDENT
			- **Climax** - the most difficult scene to create
			- **Central Plot's Inciting Incident** - second most difficult scene
			-

	- ## 9 ACT DESIGN
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### PROGRESSIVE COMPLICATIONS
			- **Progressive Complications** - the body of story that spans from the Inciting Incident to the Crisis/Climax in the final act
			- ### Points of No Return
				- **Minimum Conservative Action**- the protagonist will always take the easiest path forward to provoke a positive response from his reality
				- **Tragic Effect of Protagonist Actions** - triggers forces of antagonism from inner, personal, or social/environmental Levels of Conflict that block his desire, cracking open the Gap between expectation and result
				- **Point of No Return**- failure risks death or catastrophic negative circumstances to the world
				- **Progressions** - the consistently rising magnitude of events that call upon the protagonist to use more willpower and risk more than before.
				- **McKee's Law of Progression** - A story must not retreat to actions of lesser quality or magnitude, but more progressively forward to a final action beyond which the audience cannot imagine another
			- ### The Law of Conflict
				- **Law of Conflict** - Nothing moves the story forward except conflict
				- **Conflict** - storytelling what sound is to music
				- **Jean-Paul Sartre**- 'the essence of reality is scarcity, a universal eternal lacking
				- **Heidegger** - time is the basic category of existence
			- ### Complication Versus Complexity
				- **The Three Levels of Conflict** - Social Conflict, Physical Conflict, Inner Conflict
				- **The Complex Story**- the writer must bring characters into conflict on all three levels of life
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669546681758_0.png)
			- ### Act Design
				- **Acts** - the macro-structure of story
				- **Turning Point**- the values at stake swing from positive to negative or negative to the positive, creating significant but minor change in their lives
				- **Poetics** - Aristotle deduces that there is a relationship between the size of the story-how long it takes to read or perform-and the number of major Turning Points necessary to tell it: the longer the work, the more major reversals
				- **Aristotle's Principle** - a story can be told in one act--a series of scenes that shape a few sequences that build up from one major reversal, ending the story
				- **The First Act** - the opening movement, 25% of the telling
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669547288748_0.png)
				- **Act Two** - subplots
				- **Shakespearean Rhythm** - five acts; seven acts; eight; or more
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669547686420_0.png)
				- **First Law of Act Design**- the multiplication of act climaxes invites cliches
				- **Second Law of Act Design** - the multiplication of acts reduces the impact of climaxes and results in repetitiousness
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669548090149_0.png)
			- ### Design Variations
				- **Story Variations** - stories vary depending on the number of major reversals in the telling
				- **The Shape of Story** - varies according to the Inciting Incident
			- ### False Ending
				- **False Ending** - a scene so seemingly complete we think for a moment that the story is over
			- ### Act Rhythm
				- **Dynamics of Story** - depends on the alternation of its value-charges
			- ### Subplots and Multiple Plots
				- **Subplot** - used to contradict the Controlling Idea of the Central Plot and thus enrich the film with irony; may be used to resonate the Controlling Idea of the Central Plot and enrich the film with variations on a theme; may be used to complicate the Central Plot
				- **Principle of Thematic Contradiction** - the genesis of multiplot films
				- **Multiplot** - frames an image of a particular society, but, unlike the static Nonplot, it weaves small stories around an idea, so that these group photos vibrate with energy

	- ## 10 SCENE DESIGN
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### TURNING POINTS
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Scene-Objective** - in each scene a character pursues a desire related to his immediate time and place
			- **Super-Objective** - the story-long quest that spans from inciting incident to Story Climax
			- **Sequence Climax** - a scene that causes a moderate reversal-change with more impact than a scene
			- **Act Climax**- a scene that causes a major reversal-change with more impact than a Sequence Climax
			- **Turning Point** - scenes that surprise, increase curiosity, increase insight, and move towards a new direction
			- ### The Question of Self-Expression
				- **To Tell Story is to Make a Promise** - Trust made between author and audience, if you give me your concentration, I'll give you surprise followed by the pleasure of discovering life, its paths and joys, at levels and in directions you never have imagined
				- **Insight**- the audience's reward for paying attention
				- **Language** - tool for self-expression and must never become a decorative end of its own
		- ### SETUPS/PAYOFFS
			- **Setups** - to layer knowledge
			- **Payoff**- to close the gap by delivering that knowledge to the audience
			- **Planted** - setups are are designed to have one meaning when at this stage, but with insight, they take on a second, more important meaning
			- **Failure of a Turning Point**- overprepare the obvious and underprepare the unusual
			- **Reasoning**- is not a priority when storytelling, it is secondary and post creativity
			- **Imagination** - priority --the willingness to think any crazy idea, to let images that may or may not make sense find their way to you
		- ### EMOTIONAL TRANSITIONS
			- **The Law of Two Emotions** - Pleasure and Pain
			- **Transition of Values** - emotions are experienced when the telling takes the audience thru a changing of values
			- **3 Conditions of Transition** - First, we must empathize with the character; Second, we must know what the character wants and share that want with the character; Third, we must understand the values at stake in the character's life; within these conditions. a change in values moves our emotions
			- **Law of Diminishing Returns** - the more often we experience something, the less effect it has; emotional experience cannot be repeated back to back with effect
			- **2 Parts of a Joke** - Setup and Punch
			- **Setup** - raises the tensions in the audience
			- **Punch** - explodes laughter
			- **Emotion**- short-term experience that peaks and burns rapidly
			- **Feeling**- long-term, pervasive, sentient background that colors whole days, weeks, even years of our lives
			- **Mood** - the *feeling* in film
		- ### THE NATURE OF CHOICE
			- **The Nature of Choice** - the choice between good and evil or between right and wrong is no choice at all
			- **True Choice**- dilemma
			- **The Dual Dilemma** - A choice between irreconcilable goods, a choice between the lesser of two evils
			- **Homer** - the story of a two-sided relationship cannot be sustained, that the simple conflict between Character A and Character B cannot be told to satisfaction
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669606685880_0.png)
			- **Three-Sided Situation**- the only form of true dilemma

	- ## 11 SCENE ANALYSIS
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Text** - the sensory surface of a work of art. (the words)
		- **Film** - the sensory surface of movies, the soundtrack, dialogue, music, and sound
		- **Subtext** - the life under the surface - thoughts and feelings both known and unknown, hidden by behavior
		- **Simultaneous duality** - recognition that everything exists on at least two levels
		- **verbal description** - the sensory surface of life, sight and sound, activity and talk
		- **inner world** - consciousness and unconscious desire, action and reaction, impulse and id, genetic and experiential imperatives
		- **Hollywood Expression** - if the scene is about what the scene is about, you're in deep shit
		- **writing on the nose** - writing dialogue and activity in which a character's deepest thoughts and feelings are expressed by what the character says and does-writing the subtext directly into the text
			- ### THE TECHNIQUE OF SCENE ANALYSIS
				- **Scene Analysis** - slice in to the pattern of behaviors at the levels of both text and subtext
				- **Five Step Scene Analysis** - McKee's scene analysis process
				- ### Step One: Define Conflict
					- **Desire** - the key to conflict
					- **Forces of Antagonism**- the thing blocking the character from getting their desire
					- **Want** - what do the forces of antagonism desire
				- ### Step Two: Note Opening Value
					- **Value at Stake** - the positive or negative charge at the opening of the scene
				- ### Step Three: Break the Scene into Beats
					- **Subtextural Action** - the action beneath the surface textual action 'begging'
				- ### Step Four: Note Closing Value and Compare with Opening Value
					- **Value-Charged Condition** - the character's charged condition compared to the beginning of the scene
				- ### Step Five: Survey Beats and Locate Turning Point
					- **Gerund Phrases** - phrases describing the actions of the characters
					- **Ill-written scenes** - scenes that lack conflict because desires are not opposed, may be antiprogressive because they're repetitious or circular, lopsided because their Turning Points come too early or too late, or lacking credibility because dialogue and action are 'on the nose.'
	- ## 12 COMPOSITION
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Composition**- the ordering and linking of scenes
		- ### UNITY AND VARIETY
			- **'Because of the Inciting Incident, the Climax has to happen'** - the Law of Unity and Variety, a causal lock between II and Climax
			- **Unity** - critical, but not sufficient
			- **Variety**- within unity, as much variety as possible must be achieved
			- **Authorial Knowledge** - the only way to truly achieve Unity and Variety
		- ### PACING
			- **Rhythm of Life** - story is a metaphor for life, it must feel like life
			- **Rhythm** - the beat between two contradictory desires; one beat we desire harmony, peace, and relaxation; but too much we become bored; we also desire challenge, tension, danger, even fear
			- **Act Two**- scenes that reduce the tension of Act I, switching to comedy, romance, a counterpointing mood
			- **Cycles** - coaching the audience to move like a long-distance runner, to push them to the limit of their attention span
		- ### RHYTHM AND TEMPO
			- **Rhythm** - set by the length of scenes
			- **Scene Ratio** - for every one-minute scene there's a four-minute scene; for every thirty-second scene, a six-minute scene
			- **low tempo** - a character staring out a window
			- **high tempo** - a riot
			- **rhythm and tempo** - using both, the writer augments the pacing based on the proximity to the climax
			- **Law of Diminishing Returns**- the more something is repeated, the less effective it is
		- ### EXPRESSING PROGRESSION
		- ### SOCIAL PROGRESSION
			- **Social Progression** - when the impact of character actions effects society
			- **Social Crescendo**- beginning the story intimately but as the character takes more actions the more people enter the story and more of society is affected
		- ### PERSONAL PROGRESSION
			- **Personal Progression** - drive actions deeply into the intimate relationships and inner lives of characters
			- **Personal Crescendo** - beginning the story with a personal issue that is easily solvable but in turn creates more and more difficult issues as the story progresses
		- ### SYMBOLIC ASCENSION
			- **Symbolic Ascension**- Build the symbolic charge of the story's imagery from the particular to the universal, the specific to the archetypal
			- **Symbolic Progression** - start with actions, locations, and roles that represent only themselves; but as the story progresses, choose images that gather greater and greater meaning, until by the end of the telling, characters, settings, and events stand for universal ideas
		- ### IRONIC ASCENSION
			- **Ironic Ascension**- turn progression on irony
			- **Irony**- the subtlest manifestation of story pleasure, 'Ah, life is just like that'
			- **Life in Duality**- the paradoxical existence of life, aware of the bottomless chasm between what life seems and what life is
			- **Key to Ironic Progression** - certainty and precision
		- ### PRINCIPLE OF TRANSITION
			- **Cycles of Rising Action** -scenes that consistently escalate in action and stake with smooth transitions
			- **Third Element**- what two scenes have in common or what they have in opposition; the hinge for a transition; something held in common by the two scenes or counterpointed between them
			- **Examples of Counterpointed Scenes** - a characterization trait; an action; an object; a word; a quality of light; a sound; an idea
	- ## 13 CRISIS, CLIMAX, RESOLUTION
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### CRISIS
			- **Crisis**- the third part of the five-part form
			- **Chinese Ideogram for Crisis** - two terms: Danger/Opportunity; Danger means the wrong decision will end in death; opportunity means the right choice will achieve our desire
			- **The Crisis**- the Obligatory Scene
			- **True Dilemma** - the crisis must be the true dilemma; true dilemma confronts the protagonist who, when face-to-face with the most powerful and focused forces of antagonism in his life, must make a decision to take one action or another in a last effort to achieve his Object of Desire
			- **Protagonist's Willpower** - at the crisis, this is most severely tested
		- ### CRISIS WITHIN THE CLIMAX
			- **Law of Climax**- the protagonist may or may not get what they want, but it wont be the way they expect
			- ### Placement of the Cricis
				- **Crisis Location** - determined by the length of the climactic action
			- ### Design of the Crisis
				- **Crisis Decision** - a deliberately static moment
		- ### CLIMAX
			- **Story Climax** - fourth of the five part structure that is full of meaning
			- **Meaning** - a revolution in values from positive to negative or negative to positive with or without irony- a value swing at the maximum charge that's absolute and irreversible; the meaning of that charge moves the heart of the audience
			- **William Goldman** - argues *the key to all story endings is to give the audience what it wants, but no the way it expects*
			- **Aristotle's Words** - an ending must be both 'inevitable and unexpected'
			- **Inevitable** - as the Inciting Incident occurs, everything and anything seems possible, but at Climax, as the audience looks back through the telling, it should seem that the path the telling took was the only path
			- **Francois Truffaut** - to create a combination of 'Spectacle and Truth'
			- **Spectacle** - climax written, not for the ear, but they eye
			- **Truth**- Controlling Idea
			- **Key Image** - a single image that sums up and concentrates all meaning and emotion
		- ### RESOLUTION
			- **Resolution**- the fifth of the five-part structure, is any material left after Climax has three possible uses
			- **Slow Curtain** - a line of description at the bottom of the last page that sends the camera slowly back or tracking along images for a few seconds, so the audience can catch its breath, gather its thoughts and leave the cinema with dignity
