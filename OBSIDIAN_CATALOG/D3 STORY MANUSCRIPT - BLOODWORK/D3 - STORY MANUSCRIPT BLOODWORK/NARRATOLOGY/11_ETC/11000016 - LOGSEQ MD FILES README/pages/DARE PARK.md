- # Who is Billy Billingsly?
	- Billy Billingsly is Nikola Tesla to Thomas Edison.
	- A benevolent genius, humble, virtuous, and loyal.
	- The man is forever changed after Thomas Edison systematically destroyed those characteristics for the sake of greed and power.
	- After such, Billingsly avoids persecution by becoming a recluse, closing down his massive laboratories and effectively disappearing from the world. **Y1**
	- Until one day, years later, the lights came back on, the big BB, on a massive cooling tower lit the night sky once again. **Y5**
	- The next day...cars, construction, and a buzz like no other.
	- A hive of activity...kinda like the middle of Manhattan....inundates the small town.
	- ### Its an amusement Park....sort of....and a water park...and a culinary destination...and.....a World's Fair.
	- **Y9**
	- ### The Dare Fare I
	- A maximal amalgamation of the world's best everything.
		- music
		- culture
		- etc
	- A grand affair, something the the world cannot deny is a celebration of the greatness of human kind.
	- For 90 days, the world is treated to a extravaganza of humanity's grandest insights into the future.
	- And after that, the BB turns off, and like before, its Billingsly disappears and the world forgets.
- # The world left to process...
	- For years after the first Dare Fare, the world is left to come down on its own.
	- After the highs are recounted, the lows and the darkness creeps out of the corners.
	- From violence, crime, extortion, murder, it seems that the vices of humanity were present as the virtues were.
	- Despite the backlash and calls for responsibility, no justice ever seems to be rendered.
	- Left at gates, law enforcement is left to explore the abandoned faclities themselves, in search for Billy.
	- But for some reason, the cops always leave empty handed or with more questions than answers.
- # 4 more years
	- **Y13**
	- Four years later, the BB lights up the sky once again.
	- And the world braces for what comes.
	- **Y17**
	- The highlights of this year are the open conflicts and riotous affairs with law enforcement.
	- It seems that the public are acutely concerned about the second coming's greatness be left untouched.
	- Unlike first, the second Dare Fare comes with controversy outright at its end.
	- The police would erect a barricade the final night as the BB lights turned off.
	- Around the perimeter of the park, all who came to its border would be arrested.
	- As word would travel around the park that final night, chaos would erupt as well as organized trafficking lol.
	- Two days after the BB lights turned off, there was no one left to leave the park.
	- Over 250 people are still known missing from BB2.
- # Two years later, the National Guard raided the labs.
	- To their surprise, the cops found every missing person. Alive and well. **Y19**
	- Yet none wanted to leave and go with them.
	- But the police would not leave. Not without Billy.
	- And so, ten years after the first Dare Fare, 20 since his grand humiliation, Billy Billingsly is brought off the reservation.
	- But to their surprise, it was not Billy.
		- well constructed fake face, like that shit in Mission Impossible.
	- It was a dude named Louis Hugh.
	- At the end of the day, they had to release him.
	- The bit of information he did slip, was that the next Dare Fare, would be the last.
		- Billingsly is dying.
	- The next they heard of him, he traveled across the country and savagely murdered Thomas Edison and destroyed his entire company.
	- He was never heard from again.
	- That night, the BB lights came on for the final time, but instead of white, the BB was a deep dark UV purple.
	- The next time they will turn off, the world will be changed forever.
- # Hat Trick Dare Fare
	- **Y27** Its the longest the lights have been on and the gates haven't been open.
	- The children conceived at DF1, are now 16 years old.
	- One of them, a kid named Howie Hugh, spends one night smoking weed on the top of his parent's trailer staring at the BB lights.
	- But unlike other nights, this one is a little different. He sees the BB lights flicker off. They go from a UV purple to the bright white BB of old.
	- At that moment, he knew, that whatever it takes, Howie had to be at the next and final Dare Fare.
		- He was meant to see those lights. He was meant to live such a shitty life. To be there on that roof. That night marked the day the rest of his life started.
	- **This is Dare Fare. The story of Howie Hugh.**
- # What made Billy Billingsly capable of creating Dare Fare?
	- Billy Billingsly's first and arguably most prolific contribution to humanity is his leadership.
		- While other marked geniuses of society are known for savantisms and breakthrough insight, Bill was known for his ability to bring together the greatest of his generation.
		- *Evagen* - is the first company founded by Billy. It specialized in the area of genetic computing as a contractor for the US Federal Government. They worked in close collaboration with DARPA in developing genetic computational systems for American intelligence agencies.
		- Evagen brought their proprietary knowledge  and experience while DARPA provided the budget and application for such research.
	- ## The Genecurse
		- Through clandestine means, the US acquired information detailing China's development of a new biogenic weapon nicknamed, *genecurse*
			- Genecurse is a systemic weapon of mass destruction designed to target certain ethnicities within a multiethnic population while minimizing collateral damage to non-targeted peoples. The weapon is designed to modify the body's DNA sequences responsible for the production of reproductive cells of men and women. The modification mutates the process of pregnancy resulting in stillbirth resembling similar symptoms of stillbirth due to acute radiation exposure.
			- China's use of the genecurse is a 'western-proof' method of genocide used against the uyghur population of China.
			- China proliferates the genecurse through the modification of a government mandated herbicide used on rice farms throughout the country.
			- The standard harvest cycle for jasmine rice is 160 days which suggests there is at least two sequences of the genecurse in the Chinese population.
			- It is unknown when the first weaponized harvest occurred, projections are made using data provided by the UN and Red Cross before their aid was terminated abruptly last week.
			- The only data discovered regarding the status of the Uyghur population is that released by the Communist party.
				- Satellite confirmed footage of the dismantling of uyghur re-education camps.
				- photos and footage of uyghur's returning to their native land in northwestern China
				- UN documentation and involvement
				- Red Cross documentation and involvement
				- None suggesting any maltreatment of the Uyghur population.
			- Suggestive Correlational intel
				- collected intel does confirm that rice purchased and provided by the UN were from weaponized yields.
				- Journal, patient notes, and personal observations provided by a pediatrician associated with a Russian Orthodox aid organization unaffiliated with western aid organizations.
				- It was turned over to the sate department after a strange and obtuse affair between the doctor and an american flight attenant in one of the long term parking garages in Dublin international airport.
				- The 'journal' was a copy of the Russian Orthodox bible in Cyrillic.
				- Using a cypher, the doctor was able to take detailed notes despite mandatory review of all material by the Communist Party.
					- 'you sure this guy a is a virtuous doctor or a some sort of wicked double-agent russian paladin?'
				- In the journal, is professional witness testimony of stillbirths, a drop to a rate of -10% childbirth and 0% pregnancy, a rise in suicide, domestic violence, overdose, and a general state of ennui of the Uyghur population.
			- ### The CIA is very fucking concerned.
				- Reports determine that China's grasp on genetic sequencing is at least two generations behind current open-source western technology
				- Six generations behind government contracted research through Evagen
				- If Evagen were to produce such a weapon using current technology, the replication error would be rounded to a 0.001%
				- Current open-source replication error is 0.01%
				- China's replication error rate is predicted to be 0.1%
				- It is impossible to calculate the probability of mutated genecurse strains distributed in China.
				- It is unknown if any yield has been distributed outside of china.
				- There is certainty that mutated strains of genecurse is in the bodies of general citizens of China.
				- However, the improbability and rarity of contracting the mutagen can result in a doctor's mis-diagnosis of whatever can occur.
				- #### The smoking gun
					- The CIA needs to know
						- if it is possible for the genecurse to spread between  contaminated people. (yes of course duh.)
						- the plausibility of the genecurse collaterally mutating to target different ethnicities.
						- the probability, and how long do we have till we're all just fucking for funsies.
	- # The Cure and the Beginning of a Beautiful Friendship
		- Billy helped create:
			- a Sentinel called Pruhtec
				- Sentinel is a term Billy came up for what scientists termed bacterioid - an bioengineered counter-viral bacteria
				- if Pruhtec detects genecurse, it will bind to it,  and then expel itself through the urinary tract.
				- It will bind to any affected tissue, and eat it and expell itself thru the urinary tract
				- The cool part is, that if you're positive, you'll *piss blue*
				- The good thing is, that if you do piss blue, it means you're cured.
			- an American method of distribution
				- free condoms
				- free lube
				- tax write off for companies that provide products containing pruhtecc
			- If you're trying to get pregnant, definitely get a prutecc
		- **Overall, a success. Miscarriages due to genecurse reports at 0%. Reported blue piss in the united states is consistently at a 0.3%. Lower than China which is at 7% and projected to double in one year.**
		- ## Sexual Revolution
			- Billy's technology eliminated the transfer rate of sexually transmitted diseases in the United States.
			- Rise of a multi-billion dollar beverage called *blomme*
				- Drink it after sexual activity, you're clean.
				- And yes, if you piss blue, it means it got rid of something bad.
				- *you can imagine the hilarious cultural influence this will have*
				- If you're drinking *blomme* then it means you got laid.
				- If you're getting laid, it means you're *cool.*
				- It also means you're safe.
				- And *safe and cool* means *performative value in muhcapitalism*
- # *....just act Capital bro*
	- Three Breakthrough technologies were developed in this partnership:
		- *Gelion* - a  genetic to digital  translation
	- hyper-adaptive training
	-
- # The Ending
	- Contextually, here is what happens:
		- An archetype detective with an 'ends justify the means attitude' - Robin Pinkerton
		- The titular naïve teen hero, Howie Hugh
		- The super villiann, Bill.
	- Final scene: Bill's massive CEO office at the top of the conn tower with BB on it.
	- Its a 3 way stand off.
		- Bill's wits vs Robin's gun vs Howie's rage
		- Robin is across the office at the entrance foyer with Howie.
		- They both helped each other to get there.
		- A mini-boss gets a surprise attack on Howie and Robin.
		- They win, and Robin kills the man with a bullet to the head.
		- Bill reveals to Robin that the man he just killed was the last heir to the the Edison throne.
			- which means....the love of his life, an Edison daughter or somewhat, the girl he conceived with during the first Dare Fare, his legitimate son, was the man he just killed.
			- Robin proposed to her at the end of the Dare Fare, she said yes. But the girl was whisked away quickly and disappeared never to be seen again.
			- Robin vowed to find her, he even became a cop in the mean time. He lead a taskforce to bring down BB and his dark shit, but really it was all in the name of finding his wife or...he doesn't really know. He knew that love was real. He knew it. And it was taken away from him, for him that's evil.
			- Robin doubles down his effort, even comes too strong at the second Dare Fare, when he finds his wife again. He finds his wife with a child, that's his. But the moment is brisk, as the police and the rioters clash. Robin tries to take them away from DF, but she fights back.
				- His wife realizes that the violence is in essence, Robin's doing. She now hates him, and runs, vowing never to see him again.
			- Robin cannot handle this, and has a meltdown scene. But he vows to win her back, vows to do things differently, and calls back his men.
			- Robin's whole arc consists of him trying to redeem himself in the eyes of his 'wife.'
			- Bill gaslights Robin, forcing him to lose control of his emotions.
			- Bill wants Robin to kill him, AKA suicide by cop.
			- Bill holds a gun to his own head. Robin points the gun at him.
			- Bill wages that at the end of all this, Robin will kill him, that he won't have to kill himself.
			- Robin puts the gun down on the ground, but then Bill moves his gun on Robin, but then Robin grabs the gun again and doesn't stop keeping it trained on Bill.
			- The mystery of the whole story is 'why?' Why the fuck is Bill doing this, why is he fucking around, why all the madness?
			- The truth is, Bill 'died' the day Edison betrayed him. He realized, that despite all the good he's ever done for the world didn't matter when there are con-men to trick the world into believing that good riotous men are wicked evil.
			- In his reclusiveness, Bill vowed two grand promises to complete before he died:
				- to kill Edison, and his entire genetic pool from the gene pool. To rid the world of true evil.
				- to force the world into submission, to see them beg for forgiveness, for them to weep at his feet for their transgressions.
				- then to reward them, to support the greatest, and truly be the good great man he always meant to be.
				- However.....things always get complicated.
				- People like Robin. Bill sees Robin as another 'true evil.' Someone who is blinded by their own righteousness, who damns someone like Bill, without realizing the own evil they reap.
			- Bill's solution to this is to force Robin to confront an impossible truth, killing his ego. So the only recourse to satiating his pain is to kill Bill.
			- Robin moves closer to Bill, 'fuck you mother fucker!'
			- Howie tackles Robin just as the shot goes off.
			- Howie slams Robin's head against the ground several times.
			- Bill cocks his revolver
			- Howie yells, 'No! no! no! don't!'
			- Bill makes a goofy face.
			- Robin overpowers Bill and makes for the gun.
			- Robin, concussed, crawling, points the gun at Bill and fires three wild shots, the final one striking Bill in the chest.
			- Bill doubles over in pain, cleary still alive by the wheezing. He throws up on the ground and all over himself.
			- The revolver clatters to the ground.
			- Robin crawls over to see Bill pull the bullet off of the chestplate he's wearing underneath his clothes
			- Robin - A VEST?!
			- Robin moves to shoot again but Bill dives under his desk.
			- Howie reenters the fight,
			- blah fight blah
			- The next key moment is that Howie has the revolver pointed at Robin, and Robin the gun at Bill
			- Bill says, 'you're gonna kill the boy, and I'm the bad one?'
			- Howie, "Don't fucking shoot! Don't fucking shoot I'll fucking kill you!"
			- Robin shoots Bill, again in the chest, but this time he shits himself.
			- Howie, 'NOOO!!' Howie fires off several shots in Robin's direction, as Robin returns covering fire as he retreats behind a couch or something.
			- Howie moves Bill, still in his chair, behind cover.
			- Howie says, 'Mr. Billingsly are you okay?'
			- Bill, 'I've been shot twice and I'm covered in my own shit and vomit.'
			- Howie, 'Do you have any more bullets?'
			- Bill reaches into his pocket and a couple rounds fall out, blood spurges from his mouth.
			- Bill says, 'I think he got me that time.'
			- Howie panics, 'what do I do?!'
			- Bill chuckles through the grotesque mess of his own doing, 'you've made it this far, son. If you live through this, you have what it takes to do greater things than even me. Just do the right thing.'
			- Robin checks his pistol mag, he's got one bullet left, shit. But he's got a plan up his sleeve.
			- Somewhere earlier in the plot we should mention that the striker fired pistols they use have a 1 in 100 chance to discharge if dropped on the ground.
			- Robin plans to fake surrender, and when the pistol drops and discharges, he plans to use the surprise to close the gap and kill Bill.
			- Robin's concussion has tunneled his vision, clouded his judgement. A river of blood leaks from his eyes and nose.
			- Robin says, 'Hey Howie, you still alive, kid?'
			- Robin explains that he wants to surrender, he's gonna throw the gun on the ground and slowly back away and take the elevator down.
			- Howie says, really? ok.
			- Robin says, oh you're really gonna let me do that?
			- Howie looks at Bill.
			- Howie says, 'yeah.'
			- Bill says, 'what the fuck, are you retarded?'
			- Howie says, 'I think I get it Mr. Billingsly, I gotta do the right thing.'
			- Howie emerges from cover first, holding his gun, pointing in the direction of Robin
			- Howie calls out that he is ready
			- Robin tells Howie exactly what he's going to do, and does all his movements slowly.
			- Robin emerges, with his hands out stretched gun in his hand. Very slowly. Until he...drops the gun.
			- It fires.
			- Robin moves so fast, Howie cant react.
			- Howie feels a pain in his gut, and his lungs give out.
			- Through blurry eyes he sees Robin, face to face with a Bowie knife stabbed straight into his gut.
			- For a moment, Robin can't believe that Howie is still conscious. He jabs deeper.
			- Howie, mimicking the same stupid face that Bill's face had when he said 'wtf are u retarded?' with a bit of 'naive, I can't believe you've done this...' effortlessly lifts the pistol to Robin's head and fires, sending half of Robin's head across the floor.
			- Howie drops the gun and slowly makes his way back to Bill.
			- The first thing he says is, 'Mr. Billingsly, please don't die.'
			- All Mr. Billingsly can do is weep. Before him is a form true goodness.
			- It is then, in those moments, that he realized there is true goodness in the world, but its purest form is only found in the innocence of children.
			- He states this to Howie through a laptop placed on Howie's lap in the ICU.
			- Mr. Billingsly states that it is only fitting to leave his legacy and all his shit that none knows about in the hands of a truly rightchous human, one who witnessed a boy turn into a man, when compelled to act selfishly, never did, in spite of being stupid, naïve, or whatever's sake....only when someone committed mortal transgressions against him, did he act.
			- The story ends with Howie returning to his trailer, to smoke some weed, and watch as two new letters adorn the conning tower and the lights come on, HH.
