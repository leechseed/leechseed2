- # Purpose
	- A center for consolidating knowledge related to LEECHSEED from several sources outside of Logseq
		- Phone Notes
		- Evernote
		- Handwritten Notes
- # Design Challanges
	- I've tried to do this so many times before.
	- However, using the model design I used from that one website and my general knowledge of the topic at hand, I believe I can take challenges and hurdles mentioned previously and fix them.
	- ## Known Hurdles
		- ### Is this appropriate to consolodate?
		- ### What defines a note as appropriate?
		- ### Can there be a standardized method of minimum quality?
		- ### How do I ensure what I upload is actually fucking useful?
		- ### Are these the only known hurdles?
		- ### How will I tackle hurdles in the future?
		- ### Should I take up track and field?
