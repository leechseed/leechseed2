- to tackle a complex topic we must break it down into smaller components.
- We must atomize it.
- However, very complex topics are not only materially a lot of stuff, it is also very dense.
- Processing these topics takes more than most consuming the information we must digest it fully.
- Think of a complex topic like a salt lick or a fucking massive mountain of marble.
- When we are tackling a complex topic, break down and illustrate the topic as a branching iceberg meme.
- Branch further and further till it's atomized. Fully atomized, we can start designing and building.

  Passion is inherently disruptive.  
  Passion must be pushed to the brink of creativity. The value is entirely based on the creator's mastery of craft. Without mastery passion has no value.  
  
  Two draft DESIGN PATTERNS for LEECHSEED.   
  
  DISRUPTIVE PASSION Pattern   
  
  STAKE ANALYTICS Pattern   
  
  BASE Pattern   
  
  Both patterns feed into the same core programming. What differs are the input values for the base parameters.   
  
  In the disruptive passion pattern, there is only one stakeholder.   
  
  In the stake analytics patten, there are multiple stakeholders, their priority decided on stake ownership percentage. Sop is the output of relevant data and risk analysis.   
  
  Earn engagement. Earn their full attention.

Meanwhile you're 18, hot af, focus on yourself, invesf in what you want to do, and if you want, disappear off the face of the earth. Most normies, like us, the creditors would hunt us down to pay our debts. Even go after our families. Is she really that dumb? Or are we the real fucking idiots?   
  Capitalism doesn't give a shit about your virtue or self respect. All it cares about is value. your value is exercised  thru debt. Her value is exercised thru income. She sold her soul for the dollar. But you sold your life for it.

- Submafia - a couple gets pissed of getting hoodwinked and scammed at every turn. So they build a network of trusted friends to do business with. Their plan takes off. the network grows, and with a bit of commission off the top the two grow an empire. a community of specialties, skills, and moral citizens turn their destiny away from the breach. From the shadows they emerge into lifestyle that calls attention. A place unfamiliar. A home far away. Neighbors grow sus while whispers and rumor spread. Old gods are  into wild and unwieldy   The gaze of a greater power descends to exert it's will. Blinded by hubris the mafia is ambushed. Powered by generations of wealth the gaze is cruel, jealous, and vain. Vowed to crush all under a wicked fist, those that challenge it's position, the gaze does not abide. Faced with destruction, the couple return to form with a dilemma. Once prey, now wiser,  the couple  offer the hoods and scammers a deal. An offer of peace in cooperation. A promise of aid in despair. an attack on one is an attack on all.  Once enemies in desperation now allies in prosperity
