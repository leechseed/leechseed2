- *Study based on the understanding of Story, Myth, and Theory*
-
- # STORY
	- *Story is a method of communication; a way of translating concepts that are presently unobservable.*
	- ## Story Formula
		- *Story is the formulation of object(s) + environment + time.*
		- Object - A *thing* that is conceivable.
		- Environment - A *place* for that *thing* to exist in.
		- Time - The universal concept in which humanity exists, yet *not control.*
		-
$$(Object + Environment + Time = Story )$$		- As the designer, we can *control object and environment.*
			- However we cannot *control time*
		- Designers can *manipulate* time, to a certain extent, but must be done with extreme caution.
		- *Duality* is a universal concept in story that is universal in the formula as well as throughout the General Study.
		- The Duality of *Control/Chaos* is expressed in story formula.
- # MYTH
	- *Myth is a story that defines a culture, people, or individual.*
	- *Myth elaborates a moment in human existence.*
- # THEORY
	- *Theory is the evolving set of knowledge, systems, and components which make a story myth.*
