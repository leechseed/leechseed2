	  > **A good story is literal in the same sense that a child’s
drawing is literal. When a child draws, he doesn’t
intend to distort but to set down exactly what he sees,
and as his gaze is direct, he sees the lines that create
motion. Now the lines of motion that interest the
writer are usually invisible. They are the lines of
spiritual motion. And in this story you should be on
the lookout for such things as the action of grace in
the Grandmother’s soul, and not for the dead bodies. 
-Flannery O'Connor**

- ## THEMATIC MODEL CONCEPTS
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664367297632_0.png)
		- Universal Theme Model 1.0 demonstrates the reduction methodology of going from Topos to Controlling Idea.
	- ### Controlling Idea Equation
		- *Controlling Idea* is how theme applied to narrative design.
		- ###
$$ \alpha + \beta = \Chi $$		- α = Value (Topos)
		- β = Cause (Theme)
		- Χ = Controlling Idea
	- #### Dramatic Question Equation
		- *Dramatic Question* is using the controlling idea to form a question which is answered by the narrative premise.
		-
$$(\Chi + ? = \oslash    )$$			- Χ = Controlling Idea
			- ? = Framing as a Question
			- ø    = Dramatic Question
	- #### Narrative Premise Equation
		- *Narrative Premise* is answering the *Dramatic Question*
		-
$$\lambda  =  \frac{\oslash}{\ \Diamond }  $$		- λ   = Narrative Premise
		- ø = Dramatic Question
		- ⋄ = Story
		-
	- ## High-Resolution Narrative Pitch Equation
		-
$$\lambda =  \frac{ \alpha + \beta + ?}{\Diamond}$$		- Putting all the elements of Theme together, we get a *high-resolution narrative pitch*
		- #### Narrative Pitch
			- A story's basic description
		- ### High-Resolution Narrative Pitch
			- A very well designed narrative pitch.
				- Designed using principles discovered in Theme Studies.
			- The basis of *Creative Discipline*
				- Becomes the *Creative Discipline Statement*
					- The statement which empowers the decision making capability of creative discipline.
	- ## THEME-2-DEVSTATE FLOW MODEL
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664370378659_0.png)
		- *DEVSTATE* - The step of narrative development where the first two forms of documentation have been created. EG: High-Resolution Narrative Pitch and Creative Discipline Statement
