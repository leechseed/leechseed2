- # PART 1 - THE WRITER AND THE ART OF STORY
	- ## INTRODUCTION
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Story is about principles, not rules.
			- 'A rule says, 'You *must* do it *this way*.'
			- 'A principle says, 'This *works*...and has through all remembered time.'
			- 'Your work needn't be modeled after the 'well-made' play; rather, it must be *well made* within the principles that shape our art.
			- Anxious, and ^^inexperienced writers^^ obey rules.
			- Rebellious, ^^unschooled writers^^ break rules.
			- *^^Artists^^ master the form.*
		- ### Story is about eternal, universal forms, not formulas.
			- 'All notions of paradigms and foolproof story models are nonsense.'
			- 'Despite trends we find an astounding variety of story designs, but no prototype.'
			- '*Story* urges the creation of works that will excite audiences and live in revival for decades.'
			- 'We need a rediscovery of the underlying tenets of our art, the guiding principles that liberate talent.'
		- ### Story is about archetypes, not stereotypes.
			- 'The ^^archetypal story^^ unearths a universally human experience, then wraps itself inside a unique, culture-specific expression.'
			- 'The ^^stereotypical story^^ reverses this pattern: It suffers a poverty of both content and form.'
			- 'An archetypal story creates settings and characters that are rare.'
			- 'Its telling illuminates conflicts so true to humankind that it journeys from culture to culture.'
			- 'Stereotypical stories stay at home, archetypal stories travel.'
			- 'No mater how intimate or epic, contemporary or historical, concrete or fantasized, ^^the world of an eminent artist^^ always strikes us as somewhat exotic or strange.'
			- 'We step wide-eyed into an untouched society, a cliché-free zone where the ordinary becomes extraordinary.'
			- 'Deep within these characters and their conflicts we discover our own humanity.'
			- 'We go to the movies to enter a new, fascinating world to inhabit vicariously another human being who at first seems so unlike us and yet at heart is like us, to live in a fictional reality that illuminates our daily reality.'
			- 'We do not wish to escape life but to find life, to use our minds in fresh, experimental ways, to flex our emotions, to enjoy, to learn, to add depth to our days.'
		- ### Story is about thoroughness, not shortcuts.
			- 'There's been no conspiracy to keep secret the truths of our art.'
			- 'The secrets of story have been as public as the library down the street.'
			- 'Nothing in the craft of storytelling is abstruse.'
			- 'If a writer fails to move us with the purity of a dramatized scene, he cannot hide behind his words.'
			- 'A writer cannot tell us what to think and how to feel.'
			- 'Writing is full of wonders but no unsolved mysteries.'
		- ### Story is about mastering the art, not second-guessing the marketplace.
			- 'No one can teach us what will sell, what won't, because *no one knows.'*
			- 'Nothing in our art is guaranteed.'
			- 'Rather than agonizing over the odds, put your energies into achieving excellence.'
			- 'Secure writers don't sell first drafts.'
			- 'Unfinished work invites tampering, while polished, mature work seals its integrity.'
		- ### Story is about respect, not disdain, for the audience.
			- 'When talented people write badly it's generally for one of two reasons:'
				- 'Blinded by an idea they're compelled to prove.'
				- 'Driven by an emotion they must express.'
			- 'When talented people write well, it is generally for this reason:'
				- 'They're moved by a desire to touch the audience.'
			- 'Filmgoers do not defend their emotions, rather they open to the storyteller often exhausting themselves.'
			- 'The audience is not only sensitive, but its collective IQ jumps twenty-five points.'
			- 'The audience is not only smart, it's smarter than most films.'
			- 'It's all a writer can do, using every bit of craft he's mastered, to keep ahead of the sharp perceptions of a focused audience.'
			- 'No film can be made to work without an understanding of the reactions and anticipations of the audience.'
			- 'You must shape your story in a way that both expresses your vision and satisfies the audience's desires.'
			- 'The audience is a force as determining of story design as any other element.'
		- ### Story is about originality, not duplication.
			- 'A story is not only what you have to say but how you say it.'
			- 'If content is cliché, the telling will be cliché.'
			- 'If your vision is deep and original, your story design will be unique.'
			- 'If the telling is conventional and predictable, it will demand stereotypical roles to act out of well-worn behaviors.'
			- 'If the story design is innovative, then settings, characters, and ideas must be equally fresh to fulfill it.'
			- 'We shape the telling to fit the substance, rework the substance to support the design.'
			- 'Never mistake eccentricity for originality.'
			- 'Difference for the sake of difference is empty.'
			- 'No serious writer would cage his vision inside a formula, or trivialize it into avant-garde fragmentations.'
			- ''Well-made formula may choke a story's voice, but art movie quirkiness will will make a bitch retarded.'
			- 'Too many filmmakers use infantile gimmicks on screen to mask their insecurities.'
			- 'A mature artist never calls attention to himself.'
			- 'A wise artist never does anything merely because it breaks convention.'
			- 'Great screenwriters are distinguished by a personal storytelling style that is inseparable from their vision, but in a profound way is their vision.'
			- 'The storyteller's story structure reveals his personal cosmology, his insight into the deepest patters and motivations for how and why things happen in the world-his map of life's hidden order.'
			- 'No matter who your heroes may be, we admire them because they are unique.'
			- 'Each has stepped out of the crowd because each selects a content like no one else, designs a form like no one else, combining the two into a style unmistakably his own.'
			- 'If you can't play every instrument in the orchestra, you are doomed to hum the same old tune.'
	- ## 1  THE STORY PROBLEM
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### THE DECLINE OF STORY
			- 'Day after day we seek an answer to the ageless question Aristotle posed in Ethics:'
				- 'How should a human being lead his life?'
				- 'But the answer eludes us.
			- 'To be entertained is to be immersed in the ceremony of story to an intellectually and emotionally satisfying end.'
			- 'All fine films, novels, and plays, through all shades of the comic and tragic, entertain when they give the audience a fresh model of life empowered with an affective meaning.'
			- 'Story isn't a flight from reality but a vehicle that caries us on our search for reality, our best effort to make sense out of the anarchy of existence.'
			- 'Media now gives us the opportunity to send stories beyond borders and languages to hundreds of millions, the overall quality of storytelling is eroding.'
			- 'Flawed and false storytelling is forced to substitute spectacle for substance, trickery for truth.'
			- 'Weak stories, desperate to hold audience attention, degenerate into multimillion-dollar demo reels.'
			- 'In Hollywood imagery becomes more and more extravagant, in Europe more and more decorative. The total effect transudes into the grotesque.'
			- 'A culture cannot evolve without honest, powerful storytelling.'
			- 'When society repeatedly experiences hollowed-out pseudo-stories, it degenerates.'
			- 'Asian filmmakers tell superb stories.'
		- ### THE LOSS OF CRAFT
			- ^^'The art of story^^ is ^^the dominant cultural force in the world.'^^
			- '^^The art of film^^ is ^^the dominant medium.'^^
			- 'Today's would-be writers rush to the typewriter without first learning their craft.'
			- 'The knowledge they gain from reading and study equals or outweighs experience, especially if that experience goes unexamined.'
			- 'Self-knowledge is the key--life plus deep reflection on our reactions to life.'
			- 'What the novice mistakes for craft is simply his unconscious absorption of story elements from media consumed.'
			- 'The unschooled writer calls this 'instinct,' but it's merely habit and its rigidly limiting.'
			- 'The method of teaching creative writing in American universities has shifted from the intrinsic to the extrinsic.'
			- 'Trends in literary theory have drawn professors away from the deep sources of story towards language, codes, and text.'
			- 'The current generation of writers has been undereducated in the prime principles of story.'
			- '^^Values^^, the positive/negative charges of life, are at the soul of our art.'
			- 'The writer shapes story around a perception of what's worth living for, what's worth dying for, what's foolish to pursue, the meaning of justice, truth-the essential values.'
			- 'The erosion of values has brought with it a corresponding erosion of story.'
		- ### THE STORY IMPERATIVE
			- 'Of the total creative effort represented in a finished work, ^^75 percent or more of a writer's labor^^ goes into designing story.'
			- '^^Designing story^^ tests the maturity and insight of the writer, his knowledge of society, nature, and the human heart.'
			- '^^Story demands^^ both vivid imagination and powerful analytic thought.'
			- 'Each of the arts is defined by its essential form.'
			- 'A writer must grasp story *form*.'
		- ### GOOD STORY WELL TOLD
			- '^^Good Story^^ means something worth telling that the world wants to hear.'
			- 'Then you must bring to the work a ^^vision^^ that's driven by fresh insights into human nature and society, coupled with in-depth knowledge of your characters and your world.'
			- 'All that and a lot of love...'
				- '^^The love of story--^^the belief that your vision can be expressed only through story, that characters can be more 'real' than people, that the fictional world is more profound than concrete.'
				- ^^'The love of truth--^^the belief that lies cripple the artist, that every truth in life must be questioned, down to one's own secret motives.'
				- ^^'The love of humanity^^--a willingness to empathize with suffering souls, to crawl inside their skins and see the world through their eyes.'
				- '^^The love of sensation^^--the desire to indulge not only the physical but the inner senses.'
				- ^^'The love of dreaming^^--the pleasure in taking leisurely rides on your imagination just to see where it leads.'
				- '^^The love of humor^^--a joy in the saving grace that restores the balance of life.'
				- '^^The love of language^^--the delight in sound and sense, syntax and semantics.'
				- '^^The love of duality^^--a feel for life's hidden contradictions, a healthy suspicion that things are not what they seem.'
				- '^^The love of perfection^^--the passion to write and rewrite in pursuit of the perfect moment.'
				- ^^'The love of uniqueness^^--the thrill of audacity and a stone-faced calm when it is met by ridicule.'
				- ^^'The love of beauty^^--an innate sense that treasures good writing, hates bad writing, and knows the difference.'
				- ^^'The love of self^^--a strength that doesn't need to be constantly reassured, that never doubts that you are indeed a writer.'
				- 'You must ^^love to write^^ and bear the loneliness.'
			- 'Your goal must be a good story *well told.*'
			- '^^This craft^^ is neither mechanics nor gimmicks.'
			- 'It is the concert of techniques by which we create a conspiracy of interest between ourselves and the audience.'
			- '^^Craft^^ is the sum total of all means used to draw the audience into deep involvement, to hold that involvement, and ultimately to reward them with a moving and meaningful experience.'
			- 'Without craft, the best a writer can do is snatch the first idea off the top of his head, then sit helpless in front of his own work, unable to answer the dreaded questions: *Is it good? Or is it sewage? If sewage, what do?*
			- 'The conscious mind, fixated on these terrible questions, blocks the subconscious.'
			- 'When the conscious mind is put to work on the objective task of executing the craft, the spontaneous surfaces.'
			- 'Mastery of craft frees the subconscious.'
			- 'What is ^^the rhythm of the writer's day^^?'
				- 'First you enter the imagined world.'
				- 'As characters speak and act, you write.'
			- 'What's the next thing you do?'
				- 'You step out of your fantasy and read what you've written.'
			- 'And what do you do as you read?'
				- 'You analyze, 'Is it good? Does it work? Why not? Should I cut? Add? Reorder?'
			- 'You write, you read; create, critique; impulse, logic; right brain, left brain; re-imagine, rewrite.'
			- 'And the quality of you rewriting, the possibility of perfection, depends on a command of the craft that guides you to correct imperfection.'
			- '^^An artist^^ is never at the mercy of the whims of impulse; he willfully exercises his craft to create harmonies of instinct and idea.'
		- ### STORY AND LIFE
			- 'The '^^personal story^^' is a understructure, slice-of-life portraiture that mistakes verisimilitude for truth.'
			- ^^Big 'T' Truth^^ is located behind, beyond, inside, below the surface of things, holding reality together or tearing it apart, and cannot be directly observed.'
			- 'The ^^'guaranteed commercial success,^^' on the other hand, is an overstructured, overcomplicated, overpopulated assault on the physical sense that bears no relationship to life whatsoever. This writer is mistaking kinesis for entertainment.'
			- 'Spectacles of this kind replace imagination with simulated actuality.'
			- 'They use story as an excuse for heretofore unseen effects that carry us into a tornado, the jaws of a dinosaur, or futuristic holocausts. But like amusement park rides, their pleasures are short-lived.'
			- 'Every decade or so technical innovation spawns a swarm of ill-told movies, for the sole purpose of exploiting spectacle.'
			- 'The writers of portraiture and spectacle, indeed all writers, must come to understand the ^^relationship of story to life:^^ *Story is a metaphor for life.*
			- '^^A story must^^ abstract from life to discover its essences, but not become an abstraction that loses all sense of life-as-lived.'
			- '^^A story must^^ be *like* life, but not so verbatim that it has no depth or meaning beyond what's obvious to everyone on the street.'
			- '^^Writers of portraiture^^ must realize that facts are neutral.'
			- '^^The weakest possible excuse^^ to include anything in a story is: 'But it actually happened.''
			- 'Everything happens; everything imaginable happens.  But story is not life in actuality.'
			- 'Mere occurrence brings us nowhere near the truth.'
			- 'What happens is fact, not truth.'
			- '^^Truth is^^ what we *think about* what happens.'
			- '^^Writers of spectacle^^ must realize that abstractions are neutral.' (VFX, Editing, Sound, etc.)
			- 'The aesthetics of film are the means to express the living content of story, but must *never* become the end in themselves.'
		- ### POWERS AND TALENTS
			- 'Writers of portraiture or spectacle are weak in story, they may be blessed with one of two essential powers.'
				- '^^Writers who lean toward reportage^^ often have the power of the senses, the power to transport corporal sensations into the reader.'
				- '^^Writers of action extravaganzas,^^ on the other hand, often have the imaginative power to lift audiences beyond what is to what could be.'
				- 'Boy sensory perception and a lively imagination are enviable gifts, but, like a good marriage, one complements the other. Alone they are diminished.'
				- '^^At one end of reality^^ is pure fact; at the other end, pure imagination.'
				- 'Spinning these ^^two poles^^ is the infinitely varied spectrum of fiction.'
				- '^^Strong storytelling^^ strikes a balance along this spectrum.'
				- 'If your writing drifts to one extreme or the other, you must learn to draw all aspects of your humanity into harmony.'
				- 'You must place yourself along ^^the creative spectrum^^: sensitive to sight, sound, and feeling, yet balancing that with the power to imagine.'
				- 'Writing also demands ^^two singular and essential talents.^^'
					- '^^The first is literary talent^^--the creative conversion of ordinary language into higher, more expressive form, vividly describing the world and capturing its human voices.'
					- '^^The second is story talent^^--the creative conversion of life itself to a more powerful, clearer, more meaningful experience.'
					- 'Pure story talent is rare.'
					- 'Instinctive genius may produce a work of quality once, but perfection and prolificness do not flow from the spontaneous and untutored.'
					- 'Stories can be expressed any way human beings can communicate.'
					- 'The material of literary talent is words; the material of story talent is *life itself.*'
			- ### CRAFT MAXIMIZES TALENT
				- 'Given the choice between trivial material brilliantly told versus profound material badly told, an audience will always choose the trivial told brilliantly.'
				- '^^Master storytellers^^ know how to squeeze life out of the least of things, while poor storytellers reduce the profound to the banal.'
				- 'Story talent is primary, literary talent secondary but essential.'
				- '^^Talent without craft^^ is like fuel without an engine. It burns wildly but accomplishes nothing.'
- # PART 2 - THE ELEMENTS OF STORY
  collapsed:: true
	-
	  > *A beautifully told story is a symphonic unity in which structure, setting, character, genre, and idea meld seamlessly. To find their harmony, the writer must study the elements of story as if they were instruments of an orchestra--first separately, then in concert.*  
	- ## 2  THE STRUCTURE SPECTRUM
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### THE TERMINOLOGY OF STORY DESIGN
			-
			  > *From an instant to eternity, from the intracranial to the intergalactic, the life story of each and every character offers encyclopedic possibilities. The mark of a master is to select only a few moments but give us a lifetime.*  
			- 'The complex expanse of *life story* must become *the story told.'*
			- 'The *story told* is often the *life story*.'
		- ### STRUCTURE
			- 'A film isn't just moments of conflict or activity, personality or emotionality, witty talk or symbols.'
			- 'What the writer seeks are *events*, for an event contains all the above and more.'
			-
			  > *^^STRUCTURE^^ is a selection of events from the characters' life stories that is composed into a strategic sequence to arouse specific emotions to express a specific view of life.*  
			- '^^An event^^ is caused by or affects people, thus delineating characters; it takes place in a setting, generating image, action, and dialogue; it draws energy from conflict producing emotion in characters and audience alike.'
			- 'Event choices cannot be displayed randomly or indifferently; they must be composed, and 'to compose' in story means much the same thing it does in music.'
			- 'What to include? To exclude? To put before and after what?'
			- 'To answer these questions you must know your purpose.'
			- '^^The design of events^^ needs a dual strategy.'
			-
			- #### Event
				- ''^^Event'^^ means *change*.'
				- '*^^Story Events^^* are meaningful, not trivial.'
				- 'To make change meaningful it must, to begin with, happen to a character.'
				-
				  > *^^A STORY EVENT^^ creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a VALUE.*  
				- 'To make change meaningful you must express it, and the audience must react to it, in terms of a value.'
				- '*Story Values* refers to the broadest sense of the idea. Values are the soul of storytelling. Ultimately ours is the art of expressing to the world a perception of values.'
				-
				  > *^^STORY VALUES^^ are the universal qualities of human experience that may shift from positive to negative, or negative to positive from one moment to the next.*  
				- *'For example: alive/dead (positive/negative) is a story value, as are love/hate, freedom/slavery, truth/lie, etc.*
				- 'All such binary qualities of experience that can reverse their charge at any moment are Story Values.'
				- 'They may be...'
					- 'moral, good/evil;'
					- 'ethical, right/wrong;'
					- 'or simply charged with value.'
				- 'Although there's a place for coincidence in storytelling, a story cannot be built out of nothing but accidental events, no matter how charged with value.'
					-
					  > *A ^^Story Event^^ creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a value and ACHIEVED THROUGH CONFLICT.*  
			- #### Scene
				-
				  > *A ^^SCENE^^ is an action through conflict in more or less continuous time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character's life on at least one value with a degree of perceptible significance. Ideally, every scene is a STORY EVENT.*  
				- 'Look closely at each^^scene you've written and ask^^ :'
					- 'What value is at stake in my character's life at this moment?'
					- 'How is that value charged at the top of the scene?'
					- 'How is that value charged at the end of the scene?'
				- 'If the answer you write down at the end of the scene is the same note you made at the opening, you now have another important question to ask:'
					- 'Why is this scene in my script?'
				- 'If the value-charged condition of the character's life stays unchanged from one end of a scene to the other, nothing meaningful happens.'
				- 'The scene has activity--talking about this, doing that--but nothing changes in value. It is a nonevent.'
				- 'Why then is the scene in the story?'
				- 'The answer is almost certain to be ^^'exposition.'^^
				- 'It's there to convey information about characters, world, or history to the eavesdropping audience.'
				- 'If^^exposition^^  is a scene's sole justification, a disciplined writer will trash it and weave its information into the film elsewhere.'
				- '*No scene that doesn't turn.* This is ^^our ideal.'^^
				- 'We work to round every scene from beginning to end by turning a value at stake in a character's life from the positive to the negative or the negative to the positive.'
				- 'Adherence to this ^^principle^^ may be difficult, but it's by no means impossible.'
				- '^^*Action genres*^^ turn on public values such as freedom/slavery or justice/injustice; the ^^*Education genre*^^ turns interior values such as self-awareness/self-deception or life as meaningful/meaningless.'
				- 'Regardless of genre, ^^the principle is universal:^^ If a scene is not a true event, cut it.'
				-
				  > *Chris and Andy are in love and live together. They wake up one morning and start to squabble. Their spat builds in the kitchen as they hurry to make breakfast. In the garage, the fight becomes nastier as they climb into their car to drive to work together. Finally words explode into violence on the highway. Andy wrenches the car to the shoulder and jumps out, ending their relationship. This series of actions and locations creates a scene: It takes the couple from the positive (in love and together) to the negative (in hate and apart).*  
				- 'The four shifts of place--bedroom to kitchen to garage to highway--are camera setups but not true scenes.'
				- 'Although they intensify behavior and make the critical moment credible, they do not change the values at stake.'
				- 'When the action reaches its Turning Point--a slamming car door and Andy's declaration, 'It's over!'--life turns upside down for the lovers, activity changes to action, and the sketch becomes a complete scene, a **Story Event**.'
				- 'The test of whether a series of activities constitutes a true scene is this:'
					- 'Could it have been written 'in one,' in a unity of time and place?'
				- 'In this case the answer is yes.'
				- 'A playwright might write this scene 'in one' because the staging limitations of the theatre often force us to keep the unities of time and place; the novelist or the screenwriter, on the other hand, might travel the scene, parsing it out in time and space to establish future locations, Chris's taste in furniture, Andy's driving habits--for any number of reasons.'
				- 'The variations are endless, but in all cases this is a single Story Event, the 'lovers break up' scene.'
			- #### Beat
				- 'Inside the scene is the smallest element of structure, the *Beat.*'
				-
				  > *^^A BEAT^^ is an exchange of behavior in action/reaction. Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene.*  
				- 'Taking a closer look at the "lovers break up" scene:'
					- 'As the alarm goes off. Chris teases Andy and he reacts in kind. As they dress, teasing turns to sarcasm and they throw insults back and forth. Now in the kitchen Chris threatens Andy with: 'If I left you, baby, you'd be so miserable...' but he calls his bluff with 'That's a misery I'd love.' In the garage Chris, afraid he's losing him, begs Andy to stay, but he laughs and ridicules his plea. Finally, in the speeding car, Chris doubles his fist and punches Andy. A fight, a squeal of brakes. Andy jumps out with a bloody nose, slams the door and shouts, 'It's over,' leaving him in shock.'
						- 'This scene is built around six beats, six distinctively different behaviors, six clear changes of action/reaction: teasing each other, followed by a give-and-take of insults, then threatening and daring each other, next pleading and ridiculing, and finally exchanges of violence that lead to the last Beat and Turning Point: Andy's decision and action that ends the relationship and Chris's dumbfounded surprise.'
			- #### Sequence
				- 'Beats build scenes.'
				- 'Scenes then build the next largest movement of story design, the *Sequence.'*
				- 'Every true scene turns the value-charged condition of the character's life, but from event to event the degree of change can differ greatly.'
				- 'Scenes cause relatively minor yet significant change.'
				- 'The capping scene of a sequence, however, delivers a more powerful, determinant charge.'
				-
				  > *A ^^SEQUENCE^^ is a series of scenes--generally two to five--that culminates with greater impact than any previous scene.*  
				- 'It's useful to title each sequence to make clear to yourself why it's in the film.'
				- 'The story purpose of this 'getting the job' sequence is to take her from *NO JOB* to *JOB.*'
			- #### Act
				- 'Scenes turn in *minor* but significant ways; a series of scenes builds a sequence that turns into a *moderate*, more impactful way; a series of sequences builds the next largest structure, the *Act*, a movement that turns on a *major* reversal in the value-charged condition of the character's life.'
				- 'The difference between a basic scene, a scene that climaxes a sequence, and a scene that climaxes an act is the degree of change, or, more precisely, the degree of impact that change has, for better or worse, on the character--on the character's inner life, personal relationships, fortunes in the world, or some combination of all these.'
				-
				  > *An ^^ACT^^ is a series of sequences that peaks in a climactic scene which causes a major reversal of values, more powerful in its impact than any previous sequence or scene.*  
			- #### Story
				- 'A series of acts builds the larges structure of all: the *^^Story^^*.'
				- 'A story is simply one huge master event.'
				- 'When you look at the value-charged situation in the life of the character at the beginning of the story, then compare it to the value-charge at the end of the story, you should see the *arc of the film*, the great sweep of change that takes life from one condition at the opening to a changed condition at the end.'
				- 'The final condition, this end change, must be *absolute* and *irreversible*.'
				- 'Change caused by a scene could be reversed: The lovers in the previous sketch could get back together; people fall in and out and back in love again every day.'
				- 'A sequence could be reversed: The Midwest businesswoman could win her job only to discover that she reports to a boss she hates and wishes she were back in Terre Haute.'
				- 'An act climax could be reversed: A character could die, as in the Act Two climax of E.T., and then come back to life.'
				- 'Scene by sequence by act, the writer creates minor, moderate, and major change, but conceivably, each of those changes could be reversed.'
				- 'This is not, however, the case in the climax of the last act.'
				-
				  > *^^STORY CLIMAX^^: A story is a series of acts that build to a last act climax or story climax which brings about absolute and irreversible change.*  
				- 'If you make the smallest element do its job, the deep purpose of the telling will be served.'
		- ### THE STORY TRIANGLE
		  collapsed:: true
			- 'Plot is an accurate term that names the internally consistent, interrelated pattern of events that move through time to shape and design a story.'
			-
			  > *To ^^PLOT^^ means to navigate through the dangerous terrain of story and when confronted by a dozen branching possibilities to choose the correct path. Plot is the writer's choice of events and their design in time.*  
			- 'In either third-person or first-person, the novelist can directly invade thought and feeling to dramatize the tale entirely on the landscape of the protagonist's inner life.'
			- 'For the screenwriter such stories are far the most fragile and difficult.'
			- 'As John Carpenter said, 'Movies are about making mental things physical.'
			- 'Plot doesn't mean ham-handed twists and turns, or high-pressure suspense and shocking surprise.'
			- 'Events must be selected and their patterning displayed through time.'
			- 'In this sense of composition or design, all stories are plotted.'
			-
			- #### Archplot, Miniplot, Antiplot
				- 'The far corners of the art create a triangle of formal possibilities that maps the universe of stories.'
				- 'Within this triangle is the totality of writers' cosmologies, all their multitudinous visions of reality and how life is lived within it.'
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668406772347_0.png){:height 346, :width 404}
				- 'To understand your place in this universe, study the coordinates of this map, compare them to your work-in-progress, and let them guide you to that point you share with other writers of a similar vision.'
				-
				- 'At the top of the story triangle are the principles that constitute *Classical Design*.'
				- 'These principles are 'classical' to the truest sense: timeless and transcultural, fundamental  to every earthly society, civilized and primitive, reaching back through millennia of oral storytelling into the shadows of time.'
				-
				  > *^^CLASSICAL DESIGN^^ means a story built around an active protagonist who struggles against primarily external forces of antagonism to pursue his or her desire, through continuous time, within a consistent and causally connected fictional reality, to a closed ending of absolute irreversible change.*  
				- 'This collection of timeless principles I call the Archplot: Arch in the dictionary sense of 'eminent above others of the same kind.''
				- 'CLASSICAL DESIGN - Archplot'
					- 'Causality'
					- 'Closed Ending'
					- 'Linear Time'
					- 'External Conflict'
					- 'Single Protagonist'
					- 'Consistent Reality'
					- 'Active Protagonist'
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668406869138_0.png){:height 232, :width 191}
				- 'The Archplot, however, is not the limit of storytelling shapes.'
				- '^^Minimalism^^ means that the writer begins with the elements of Classical Design but then reduces them--shrinking or compressing, trimming or truncating the prominent features of the Archplot.'
				- 'I call this set of minimalist variations *^^Miniplot^^*.'
				- 'Miniplot does not mean *no plot*, for its story must be as beautifully executed as an Archplot.'
				- 'Minimalism strives for simplicity and economy while retaining enough of the classical that the film will still satisfy the audience.'
				- 'MINIMALISM - Miniplot'
					- 'Open Ending'
					- 'Internal Conflict'
					- 'Multi-Protagonists'
					- 'Passive Protagonist'
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668406911332_0.png){:height 181, :width 205}
				- '*^^Antiplot^^*, the cinema counterpart to the antinovel or Nouveau Roman and Theatre of the Absurd.'
				- 'This set of antistructure variations doesn't reduce the Classical but reverses it, contradicting traditional forms to exploit, perhaps ridicule the very idea of formal principles.'
				- 'ANTI-STRUCTURE - Antiplot'

				- 'The Archplot is the meat, potatoes, pasta, rice, and couscous of world cinema.'
		- ### FORMAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE STORY TRIANGLE
		  collapsed:: true
			- #### Closed Versus Open Endings
				- 'The Archplot delivers a closed ending--all questions raised by he story are answered; all emotions evoked are satisfied.'
				- 'Miniplot, on the other hand, often leaves the ending somewhat open.'
				- 'Most of the questions raised by the telling are answered, but an unanswered question or two may trail out of the film, leaving the audience to supply it subsequent to the viewing.'
				- 'The question must be answerable, the emotion resolvable.'
				- 'All that has gone before leads to clear and limited alternatives that make a degree of closure possible.'
				-
				  > *A Story Climax of absolute, irreversible change that answers all questions raised by the telling and satisfies all audience emotion is a ^^CLOSED ENDING^^.*  
				-
				  > 'A Story Climax that leaves a question or two unanswered and some emotion unfulfilled is an ^^OPEN ENDING^^.'  
			- #### External Versus Internal Conflict
				- 'The Archplot puts emphasis on external conflict.'
				- 'The emphasis falls on their struggles with personal relationships, with social institutions, or with forces in the physical world.'
				- 'In Miniplot the protagonist may have strong external conflicts with family, society, and environment, but emphasis will fall on the battles within his own thoughts and feelings, conscious or unconscious.'
			- #### Single Versus Multiple Protagonists
				- 'The^^classically told story^^  usually places a single protagonist--man, woman, or child--at the heart of the telling'
				- 'One major story dominates screentime and its protagonist is the star role.'
				- 'If the writer splinters the film into a number of relatively small, subplot-sized stories, each with a separate protagonist, the result minimalizes the roller-coaster dynamic of the Archplot and creates a variation of Multiplot variation of the Miniplot.'
			- #### Active Versus Passive Protagonist
				- The single protagonist of an Archplot tends to be active and dynamic, willfully pursuing desire through ever-escalating conflict and change.'
				- 'The protagonist of a Miniplot design, although not inert, is relatively reactive and passive.'
				- 'This passivity is compensated for either by giving the protagonist a powerful inner struggle or by surrounding him with dramatic events as in the Multiplot design.'
				-
				  > *An ^^ACTIVE PROTAGONIST^^, in the pursuit of desire, takes action in direct conflict with the people and the world around him.*  
				-
				  > *A ^^PASSIVE PROTAGONIST^^ is outwardly inactive while pursuing desire inwardly, in conflict with aspects of his or her own nature.*  
			- #### Linear Versus Nonlinear Time
				- 'An Archplot begins at a certain point in time, moves elliptically through more or less continuous time, and ends at a later date.'
				- 'If flashbacks are used, they are handled so that the audience can place the story's events in their temporal order.'
				- 'An Antiplot is disjunctive, scrambling or fragmenting time to make it difficult, if not impossible to sort what happened into any linear sequence.'
				- 'Godard remarked that in his aesthetic a film must have a beginning, middle, and end...but not necessarily in that order.'
				-
				  > *A story with or without flashbacks and arranged into a temporal order of events that the audience can follow is told in ^^LINEAR TIME^^.*  
				-
				  > *A story that either skips helter-skelter through time or so blurs temporal continuity that the audience cannot sort out what happens before and after what is told in ^^NONLINEAR TIME^^.  
			- #### Causality Versus Coincidence
				- 'The Archplot stresses how things happen in the world, how a cause creates an effect, how this effect becomes a cause that triggers yet another effect.'
				- 'Classical story design charts the vast interconnectedness of life from the obvious to the impenetrable, from the intimate to the epic, from individual identity to the international infosphere.'
				- 'It lays bare the network of chain-linked causalities that, when understood, gives life meaning.'
				- 'The Antiplot, on the other hand, often substitutes coincidence for causality, putting emphasis on the random collisions of things in the universe that break the chains of causality and lead to fragmentation, meaninglessness, and absurdity.'
				-
				  > *^^CAUSALITY^^ drives a story in which motivated actions cause effects that in turn become the causes of yet other effects, thereby interlinking the various levels of conflict in a chain reaction of episodes to the Story Climax, expressing the interconnectedness of reality.*  
				-
				  > *^^COINCIDENCE^^ drives a fictional world in which unmotivated actions trigger events that do not cause further effects, and therefore fragment the story into divergent episodes and an open ending, expressing the disconnectedness of existence.*  
			- #### Consistent Versus Inconsistent Realities
				- 'An ^^Archplot^^ unfolds within a consistent reality but in this case doesn't mean actuality.'
				- 'Each fictional reality uniquely establishes how things happen within it.'
				- 'In an Archplot these rules cannot be broken--even if they are bizarre.'
				-
				  > *^^CONSISTENT REALITIES^^ are fictional settings that establish modes of interaction between characters and their world that are kept consistently throughout the telling to create meaning.*  
				- 'All works in the *Fantasy* genre, for example, are Archplots in which whimsical rules of 'reality' are strictly obeyed.'
				- 'Having created story rules of causality, the writer of an Archplot must work within his self-created discipline.'
				- 'Consistent Reality, therefore, means an internally consistent world, true to itself.'
				-
				  > *^^INCONSISTENT REALITIES^^ are settings that mix modes of interaction so that the story's episodes jump inconsistently from one 'reality' to another to create a sense of absurdity.'*  
				- 'In an ^^Antiplot^^ the only rule is to break the rules.'
				- 'Expressionism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Stream of Consciousness, Theatre of the Absurd, the antinovel, the cinematic antistructure may differ in technique but share the same result: a retreat inside the artist's private world to which the audience is admitted at the artist's discretion.'
				- 'The seven formal contradictions and contrasts listed above are not hard and fast.'
				- 'There are unlimited shades and degrees.'
				- 'All storytelling possibilities are distributed inside the story design triangle, but very few films are of such purity of form that they settle at its extreme corners.'
				- 'Each side of the triangle is a spectrum of structural choices, and writers slide their stories along these lines, blending or borrowing from each extreme.'
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1668426096046_0.png){:height 362, :width 414}
			- #### Change Versus Stasis
				- 'Above the line drawn between Miniplot and Antiplot are stories in which life clearly changes.'
				- 'At the limits of ^^Miniplot^^, however, change may be virtually invisible because it occurs at the deepest level of inner conflict.'
				- 'Below this line stories remain in stasis and do not arc.'
				- 'The value-charged condition of the character's life at the end of the film is virtually identical to that at the opening.'
				- 'Story dissolves into portraiture, either a portrait of verisimilitude or one of absurdity.'
				- 'I term these films *^^Nonplot^^.*
				- 'Although they inform us, touch us, and have their own rhetorical or formal structures, they do not tell story.'
				- 'Therefore, they fall outside the story triangle and into a realm that would include everything that could be loosely called 'narrative.'
				- 'Antistructured Nonplots also trace a circular pattern but turn it with absurdity and satire done in a supra-unnaturalistic style.'
		- ### THE POLITICS OF STORY DESIGN
			- 'In an ideal world art and politics would never touch.'
			- 'In reality they can't keep their hands off each other.'
			- 'So as in all things, politics lurks inside of the story triangle:'
				- 'The politics of taste,'
				- 'The politics of artistic versus commercial success.'
			- 'Americans are escapees from prisons of stagnant culture and rigid class who crave change.'
			- 'We change and change again, trying to find what, if anything, works.'
			- 'After weaving the trillion-dollar safety net of the Great Society, we're not shredding it.'
			- 'The Old World, on the other hand, has learned through centuries of hard experience to fear such change, that social transformations inevitably bring war, famine, chaos.'
			- 'The result is our polarized attitude toward story:'
				- 'The ingenuous optimism of Hollywood (not naïve about change but about its insistence on positive change) versus the equally ingenuous pessimism of the *art film* (not naïve about the human condition but about its insistence that it will never be other than negative or static).'
			- 'Minimalists overestimate the appetite of even the most self-absorbed minds for a diet of nothing but inner conflict.'
			- 'They also overestimate their talent to express the unseeable on screen.'
			- 'Hollywood's action filmmakers underestimate the interest of their audience in character, thought, and feeling, and, worse, overestimate their ability to avoid *Action* genre clichés.'
			- 'From story to story the writer may move anywhere within the triangle, but most of us feel more at home in one place or another.'
			- 'As you do, let me offer these points for you to weigh:'
				- #### The Writer Must Earn His Living Writing
					- '^^Most human beings believe^^...'
						- 'that life brings closed experiences of absolute, irreversible change;'
						- 'their greatest sources of conflict are external to themselves;'
						- 'that they are the single and active protagonists of their own existence;'
						- 'that their existence operates through continuous time within a consistent, casually interconnected reality;'
						- 'and that inside this reality events happen for explainable and meaningful reasons.'
					- '^^Classical design^^ is a model of memory and anticipation.'
					- 'We collect and shape memories around an Archplot to bring back the past vividly.'
					- 'We mold our fantasies and hopes into an Archplot.'
					- 'Classical design displays the temporal, spatial, and causal patterns of human perception, outside which the mind rebels.'
					- 'The Archplot is neither ancient nor modern, Western nor Eastern; it is human.'
					- 'When the audience sense that  a story is drifting too close to fictional realities ti finds tedious or meaningless, it feels alienated and turns away.'
					- 'This is true of intelligent, sensitive people of all income and backgrounds.'
					- 'The vast majority of human beings cannot endorse the inconsistent realties of Antiplot, the internalized passivity of Miniplot, and the static circularity of Nonplot as metaphors for life as they live it.'
					- 'As the story reaches the bottom of the triangle the audience has shrunk to those loyal cinephile intellectuals who like to have their realities twisted once in a while.'
					- 'This is an enthusiastic, challenging audience...but a very small audience.'
					- 'If a Hollywood studio is going to take this wild ride with you, you must write a film that has at least a chance of recouping its huge risk.'
					- 'In other words, a film that leans toward the Archplot.'
				- #### The Writer Must Master Classical Form
					- '^^The history of art^^ is a history of revivals: Establishment icons are shattered by an avant-garde that in time becomes the new establishment to be attacked by a new avant-garde that uses its grandfather's for m of weapons.'
					- 'Rock'n'roll, which was named after black slang for sex, began as an avant-garde movement against the white-bread sounds of the postwar era.'
					- 'Now it's the definition of musical aristocracy and even used as church music.'
					- 'Respecting these cycles, great storytellers have always known that, regardless of background or education, everyone, consciously or instinctively, enters the story ritual with ^^Classical anticipation^^.'
					- 'You'll know you understand it *when you can do it.*
					- 'The writer works at his skills until knowledge shifts from the left side of the brain to the right, until the intellectual awareness becomes living craft.'
				- #### The Writer Must Believe in What He Writes
					- '^^Stanislavski^^ asked his actors: Are you in love with the art in yourself or yourself in the art?'
					- 'You too must examine your motives for wanting to write the way you write.'
					- 'Each tale you create says to the audience: 'I believe life is like *this.*'
					- 'Every moment must be filled with your passionate conviction or we smell a phony.'
					- 'The young are taught that Hollywood and art are antithetical.'
					- 'A story is the embodiment of our ideas and passions in ^^Edmund Husserl's^^ phrase, 'an objective correlative' for the feelings and insights we wish to instill in the audience.'
					- 'When you work with one eye on your script and the other on Hollywood, making eccentric choices to avoid the taint of commercialism, you produce the literary equivalent of a temper tantrum.'
					- 'Angry contradiction of the patriarch is not creativity; it's delinquency calling for attention.'
					- 'Write only what you believe.'
	- ## 3 STRUCTURE AND SETTING
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### THE WAR ON CLICHé
			- 'This may be the most demanding time in history to be a writer'
			- 'By the time modern filmgoers sit down to your work, they've absorbed tens of thousands of hours of TV, movies, prose, and theatre.'
			- '^^Cliché^^ is at the root of audience dissatisfaction, and like a plague spread through ignorance, it now infects all story media.'
			- 'The cause of this worldwide epidemic is simple and clear; ^^the source of all clichés^^ can be traced to one thing and one thing alone: *The writer does not know the world of his story.*
			- 'Such writers select a setting and launch a screenplay assuming a knowledge of their fictional world that they don't have.'
			- 'Knowledge of and insight into the world of your story is fundamental to the achievement of originality and excellence.'
		- ### SETTING
			-
			  > **A story's ^^SETTING i^^s four-dimensional**--*Period, Duration, Location, and Level of Conflict.*  
			-
			- 'The first dimension of time is Period.'
			- 'Is the story set in the contemporary world? In history? A hypothetical future?
			- 'Or is it that rare fantasy which location in time is unknowable and irrelevant?'
				-
				  > **^^PERIOD^^ is a story's place in time.**  
			- 'Duration is the second dimension of time.'
				-
				  > **^^DURATION^^ is the story's length through time.**  
			- 'Location is the story's physical dimension.
			- 'What is the story's specific geography? In what town? On what streets? etc.'
				-
				  > **^^LOCATION^^ is a story's place in space.**  
			- '^^Level of Conflict^^ is the human dimension.'
			- 'The cast of characters, containing its various levels of conflict, is part of a story's setting.'
			- 'Does your story focus on the inner, even unconscious conflicts within your characters?'
			- 'Or coming up a level, on personal conflicts?'
			- 'Or higher and wider, on battles with institutions in society?'
			- 'Wider still, on struggles against forces of the environment?'
			- 'Your story may be set at any one or any combination of these levels.'
				-
				  > **^^LEVEL OF CONFLICT^^ is the story's position on the hierarchy of human struggles.**  
			- #### The Relationship Between Structure and Setting
				- 'A story's setting sharply defines and confines its possibilities.'
				- 'Within any world, no matter how imaginary, only certain events are possible or probable.'
				-
				  > **A STORY must obey its own internal laws of probability. The event choices of the writer, therefore, are limited to the ^^possibilities^^ and ^^probabilities^^ within the world he creates.**  
				- 'Each fiction world creates a unique cosmology and makes its own 'rules' for how and why things happen within it.'
				- 'Stories do not materialize from a void but grow out of materials in history and human experience.'
				- 'Once the audience grasps the laws of your reality, they feel violated if you break them and rejects your work as illogical and unconvincing.'
				- 'Seen this way, the setting may feel like a straitjacket to the imagination.'
				- 'There is no such thing as a portable story.'
				- 'An honest story is at home in one, and only one, place in time.'
		- ### THE PRINCIPLE OF CREATIVE LIMITATION
			- 'Limitation is vital. The first step towards a well-told story is to create a small, ^^*knowable* world.'^^
			- 'The constraint that setting imposes on story design doesn't inhibit creativity; it inspires it.'
			- 'All fine stories take place within a limited, knowable world.'
			- 'DR. STRANGELOVE is set in the office of General Jack D. Ripper, a B-52 Bomber heading for Russia, and the War Room of the Pentagon.'
			- 'It climaxes in planetary nuclear annihilation, but the telling is limited to three sets and eight principal characters.'
			- 'The world of a story must be small enough that the mind of a single artist can surround the fictional universe it creates and come to know it in the same depth and detail that God knows the one He created.'
			- By the time you finish your last draft, you must possess a commanding knowledge of your setting in such depth and detail that no one could raise a question about your world-from the eating habits of your characters to the weather in September--that you couldn't answer instantly.'
			- 'A '^^small' world^^, however, does not mean a trivial world.'
			- 'Small,' in this case, means ^^knowable.'^^
			- '^^Commanding knowledge,'^^ does not mean an extended awareness into every crevice of existence. It means knowledge of all that's germane.'
			- 'A limited world and restricted cast offer the possibility of knowledge in depth and bredth.'
			-
			  > *The irony of setting versus story is this: The larger the world, the more diluted the knowledge of the writer, therefore the fewer his creative choices and the more cliched the story. The smaller the world, the more complete the knowledge of the writer, therefore the greater his creative choices. Result: a full original story and victory in the world on cliché.'*  
		- ### RESEARCH
			- The key to winning this war is research, taking the time and effort to acquire knowledge.'
			- 'I suggest these ^^specific methods^^: research of memory, research of imagination, research of fact.'
			- 'Generally, a story needs all three.'
			- #### Memory
				- 'Lean back from your desk and ask, 'What do I know from ^^personal experience^^ that touches my characters' lives?'
				- 'In your head it's only memory, but written down it becomes working knowledge.'
			- #### Imagination
				- 'Lean back and ask, 'What would it be like to live my character's life hour by hour, day by day?'
				- 'In vivid detail sketch how your characters shop, make love,  pray-scenes that may or may not find their way into your story, but drew you into your imagined world until it feels like deja vu.'
				- 'While memory gives us whole chunks of life, ^^imagination^^ ^^takes fragments, slivers of dream, and chips of experience that seem unrelated, then seeks their hidden connections and merges them into a whole.'^^
				- 'Having found these links and envisioned the scenes, write them down.'
				- 'A working imagination is research.'
			- #### 'Fact'
				- 'Have you ever had ^^writer's block^^?'
				- 'You're blocked because you have nothing to say.'
				- 'Research not only wins the war on cliché, it's the key to victory over fear and its cousin, depression.'
				- 'Research from memory, imagination, and fact is often followed by a phenomenon that authors love to describe in mythical terms.'
				- 'While research provides material, it's no substitute for creativity.'
				- A story is not an accumulation of information strung into a narrative, but a design of events to carry us to a meaningful climax.'
				- 'What's more, research must not become procrastination. Too many insecure talents spend years in study and never actually write anything.'
				- 'We do not first fill notebooks full of social biographical, and historical studies, and once all this work is done, begin to compose a story.'
				- 'Creativity is rarely so rational. Origination and exploration go on alternatively.'
				- 'As new ideas seed your story, story and characters grow; as your story grows, questions are raised and it hungers for more research.'
				- 'Creation and investigation go back and fourth, making demands on each other, pushing and pulling this way or that until the story shakes itself out, complete and alive.'
		- ### CREATIVE CHOICES
			- Fine writing is never one to one, never a matter of devising the exact number of events necessary to fill a story, then penciling in dialogue.'
			- 'When actors compliment each other, for example, they often say, 'I like your choices.' They know that if a colleague has arrived at a beautiful moment, it's because in rehearsal the actor tried it twenty different ways, then chose one perfect moment. The same is true for us.'
			-
			  > **^^CREATIVITY^^ means creative choices of inclusion and exclusion**  
			- 'If you know the craft, you know how to cure clichés: Sketch ten different ways two high-school lovers meet.
			- 'True inspiration comes from a deeper source, so let loose your imagination.'
			- 'You needn't write out these scenes in full. You're on a search for ideas, so simply sketch the broad strokes of what happens.'
			- 'Once you've exhausted your best ideas, survey your list, asking these questions:'
				- 'Which scene is truest to my characters?'
				- 'Truest to their world?'
				- '*And has never been on the screen quite this way before?*'
				- 'This is the one you write into the screenplay.'
			- ^^'If your scene is cliche,^^ but your instinct tells you its *the one*, start a new list.
			- '^^A dozen different ways^^ two high-school lovers meet by having adjacent lockers.'
			- 'Research this world, hang out, observe the crows, get involved, until you know the high-school locker scene like no writer before you.' *Ok so, this is fiction, so arguably you wouldn't want this 'research' to be at an actual high-school.*
			- 'Scanning your new list you ask the same questions as before.'
			- 'If your finished screenplay contains every scene you've ever written, if you've never thrown an idea away,  if your rewriting is little more than tinkering with dialogue, your work will almost certainly fail.'
			- 'If, however, research inspires a pace of ten to one, even twenty to one, and if you then make brilliant choices to find that 10 percent of excellence and burn the rest, every scene will fascinate and the world will sit in awe of your genius.'
			- 'No one has to see your failures unless you add vanity to folly and exhibit them.'
			- 'Genius consists not only of the power to create expressive beats and scenes, but of the taste, judgement, and will to weed out and destroy banalities, conceits, false notes, and lies.'
	- ## 4 STRUCTURE AND GENRE
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### THE FILM GENRES
		  collapsed:: true
			- 'Through tens of thousands of years told at fireside, four millennia of the written word, twenty-five hundred years of theatre, a century of film, and eight decades of broadcasting, countless generations of storytellers have spun story into an astonishing diversity of patterns.'
			- 'To make sense of this outpouring, various systems have been devised to sort stories according to shared elements, classifying them by *genre.*'
			- 'No two systems, however, have ever agreed on which story elements to use in the sorting, and, therefore, no two agree on the number and kind of genres.'
			- 'Aristotle gave us the first genres by dividing dramas according to the value-change of their ending versus their story design.'
			- 'The result is his four basic genres: Simple Tragic, Simple Fortunate, Complex Tragic, Complex Fortunate.'
			- 'While scholars dispute definition sand systems, the audience is already a genre expert.'
			- 'This two-handed trick is impossible without a knowledge of genre that surpasses the audience's.'
			- 'Below is the genre and subgenre system used by screen-writers--a system that's evolved from practice, not theory, and that turns on differences of subject, setting, role, event, and values.'
				- 1. ^^**LOVE STORY.**^^ Its subgenre, **Buddy Salvation**, substitutes friendship for romantic love.
				- 2. ^^**HORROR FILM.**^^ This genre divides into three subgenres: the **Uncanny,** in which the source of horror is astounding but subject to 'rational' explanation, such as beings from outer space, science-made monsters, or a maniac; the **Supernatural,** in which the source of horrid an 'irrational' phenomenon from the spirit realm; and the **Super-Uncanny,** in which the audience is kept guessing between the other two possibilities.
				- 3. ^^**MODERN EPIC**^^ (the individual versus the state).
				-
				  id:: 6376f717-4c2f-414e-ad09-0ac0c3728538
					4. ^^**WESTERN.**^^ The evolution of the genre and its subgenres is brilliantly tranced in Will Wright's *Six Guns and Society*

				- 5. ^^**WAR GENRE.**^^ Although war is often the setting for another genre, such as the **Love Story,** the **WAR GENRE** is specifically about combat. **Pro-War** versus **Antiwar** are its primary subgenres. Contemporary films generally oppose war, but for decades the majority covertly glorified it, even in its most grisly form.
				- 6. ^^**MATURATION PLOT.**^^ or the coming-of-age story.
				- 7. ^^**REDEMPTION PLOT.**^^ Here the film arcs on a moral change within the protagonist from bad to good.
				- 8. ^^**PUNITIVE PLOT.**^^ In these the good guy turns bad and is punished.
				- 9. ^^**TESTING PLOT.**^^ Stories of willpower versus temptation to surrender.
				- 10.^^**EDUCATION PLOT.**^^  This genre arcs on a deep change within the protagonist's view of life, people, or self rom the negative (naive, distrustful, fatalistic, self-hating) to the positive (wise, trusting, optimistic, self-possessed).
				- 11. ^^**DISILLUSIONMENT PLOT.**^^ A deep change of worldview from the positive to the negative.
				- 12. ^^**COMEDY.**^^ Subgenres range from **Parody** to **Satire** to **Sitcom** to **Romantic** to **Screwball** to **Farce** to **Black Comedy**, all differing by the focus of comic attack (bureaucratic folly, upper-class-manners, teenage courtship, etc.) and the degree of ridicule (gentle, caustic, lethal).
				- 13. ^^**CRIME.**^^ Subgenres vary chiefly by the answer to this question: From whose point of view do we regard the crime? **Murder Mystery** (master detective's POV); **Caper** (master criminal's POV); **Detective** (cop's POV); **Gangster** (crook's POV); **Thriller** or **Revenge Tale** (victim's POV); **Courtroom** (lawyer's POV); **Prison Drama** (inmate's POV); **Espionage** (spy's POV); **Newspaper** (reporter's POV); **Film Noir**(POV of a protagonist who may be part criminal, part detective, part victim of a femme fatale.)
				- 14. ^^**SOCIAL DRAMA.**^^ This genre identifies problems in society--poverty, the education system, communicable diseases, the disadvantaged, antisocial rebellion, and the like--then constructs a story demonstrating a cure. It has a number of sharply focused subgenres: **Domestic Drama** (problems within the family), the **Woman's Film** (dilemmas such as career versus family, lover versus children), **Political Drama** (corruption in politics), **Eco-Drama** (battles to save the environment), **Medical Drama** (struggles with physical illness), and **Psycho-Drama** (struggles with mental illness).
				- 15. ^^**ACTION/ADVENTURE.**^^ This often borrows aspects from other genres such as **War** or **Political Drama** to use as motivation for explosive action and derring-do. If **ACTION/ADVENTURE** incorporates ideas such as destiny, hubris, or the spiritual, it becomes the subgenre **High Adventure.** If Mother Nature is the source of antagonism, it's a **Disaster/Survival Film.**
			- Taking a still wider view, supra-genres are created out of settings, performance styles, or filmmaking techniques that contain a host of autonomous genres.
			- They are like mansions of many rooms where one of the basic genres, subgenres, or any combination might find a home:
				- 16. ^^**HISTORICAL DRAMA.**^^ History is an inexhaustible source of story material and embraces every type of story imaginable. The treasure chest of history, however, is sealed with this warning: What is past must be present. A screenwriter must find an audience today. Therefore, the best use of history, and the only legitimate excuse to set a film in the past and thereby add untold millions to the budget, is anachronism--to use the past as a clear glass through which  you show us the present.
			- Many contemporary antagonisms are so distressing or loaded with controversy that it's difficult to dramatize them in a present-day setting without alienating the audience. Such dilemmas are often best viewed at a safe distance in time. **HISTORICAL DRAMA** polishes the past into a mirror of the present, making clear and bearable the painful problems of racism, religious strife, or violence of all kinds, especially against women.
			- Despite an antiquated setting, within minutes an audience can feel immediately at home with corrupted aristocrats--they are us.
				- 17.^^**BIOGRAPHY.**^^ This cousin to **Historical Drama** focuses on a person rather than an era. **BIOGRAPHY,** however, must never become a simple chronicle. The biographer must interpret facts as if they were fiction, find meaning of the subject's life, then cast him as the protagonist of his life's genre.
			- These caveats apply equally to the subgenre **Autobiography.**
			- For while it's true that the unexamined life is not worth living, it's also the case that the unlived life isn't worth examining.
				- 18. ^^**DOCU-DRAMA.**^^ A second cousin to **Historical Drama,** **DOCU-DRAMA** centers on recent rather than past events.
				- 19. ^^**MOCKUMENTARY.**^^ This genre pretends to be rooted in actuality or memory, behaves like documentary or autobiography, but is utter fiction. It subverts fact-based filmmaking to satirize hypocritical institutions: the backstage world of rock'n'roll, the Catholic Church; middle-class mores; journalism; politics; and crass American values.
				- 20. ^^**MUSICAL.**^^ Descended from opera, this genre presents a 'reality' in which characters sing and dance their stories. it's often a **Love Story, ** but it can be **Film Noir**; **Social Drama;** **Punitive Plot**; **Biography**. Any genre can work in musical form and all can be satirized in **Musical Comedy.**
				- 21. ^^**SCIENCE FICTION.**^^ In hypothetical futures that are typically technological dystopias of tyranny and chaos, the **SCIENCE FICTION** writer often marries the man-against-state **Modern Epic** with **Action/Adventure.** But, like history, the future is a setting in which any genre may play. Andrei Tarkovsky used sci-fi to act out the inner conflicts of a **Disillusionment Plot.**
				- 22. ^^**SPORTS GENRE.**^^ Sport is a crucible for character change. This genre is a natural home for the **Maturation Plot;** the **Redemption Plot;** the **Education Plot;** the **Punitive Plot;** the **Testing Plot;** the **Disillusionment Plot;** the **Buddy Salvation;** or **Social Drama.**
				- 23. ^^**FANTASY.**^^ Here the writer plays with time, space, and the physical, bending and mixing the laws of nature and the supernatural. The extra-realities of **FANTASY** attract the **Action** genres but also welcome others such as the **Love Story;** **Political Drama/Allegory;** **Social Drama;** or **Maturation Plot.**
				- 24. ^^**ANIMATION.**^^ Here the law of universal metamorphism rules: Anything can become something else. Like **Fantasy** and **Science Fiction,** **ANIMATION** leans toward the **Action** genres of cartoon **Farce;** or **High Adventure;** **Maturation Plots**; but as the animators of Eastern Europe and Japan have shown, there are no restraints.
			- Lastly, for those who believe that genres and their conventions are concerns of 'commercial' writers only, and that series art is nongenetic, let me add one last name to the list:
				- 25. ^^**ART FILM.**^^ The avant-garde notion of writing outside the genres is naïve. No one writes in a vacuum. The **ART FILM** has become a traditional genre, divisible into two subgenres **Minimalism** and **Antistructuralism,** each with its own complex of formal conventions of structure and cosmology. Like **Historical Drama**, the **ART FILM** is a supra-genre that embraces other basic genres: **Love Story, Political Drama,** and the like.
			- Although this slate is reasonably comprehensive, no list cna ever be definitive or exhaustive because the lines between genres often overlap as they influence and merge with one another.
			- Each writer's homework is first to identify his genre, then research its governing practices.
			- There is no escaping these tasks.
			- We're all genre writers.
			-
		- ### THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND GENRE
			- Each genre imposes conventions on story design: conventional value-charges at climax such as the down-ending of the *Disillusionment Plot*; conventional settings such as the *Western;* conventional events such as boy-meets-girl in the *Love Story;* conventional roles such as the criminal in a *Crime Story.*
			- The audience knows these conventions and expects to see them fulfilled.
			- The choice of genre sharply determines and limits what's possible within a story, as its design must envision the audience's knowledge and anticipations.
			-
			  > **^^GENRE CONVENTIONS^^ are specific settings, roles, events, and values that define individual genres and their subgenres.**  
			- Each genre has unique conventions, but in some these are relatively uncomplicated and pliable.
			- Other genres are relatively inflexible and filled with a complex of rigid conventions.
			- *Comedy* contains myriad of subgenres as well, each with its own conventions, but one overriding convention unites this mega-genre and distinguishes it from drama: *Nobody gets hurt.*
			- By genre convention, the comedy writer walks the line between putting characters through the torments of hell while safely reassuring the audience that the flames don't really burn.
			- Across that line waits the subgenre of *Black Comedy.*
			- Here the writer bends comic convention and allows his audience to feel sharp, but not unbearable, pain.
			- *Art Films* are conventionalized by a number of external practices such as the absence of stars (or stars' salaries,) production outside the Hollywood system, generally in a language other than English--all of which become sales points as the marketing team encourages critics to champion the film as an underdog.
			- *Minimalist* and/or *Antistructure* unconventionality is the *Art Film's* distinguishing convention.
			- Success in the *Art Film* genre usually results in instant, though often temporary, recognition of an artist.
			- Hitchcock knew that *there is no necessary contradiction between art and popular success, nor a necessary connection between art and Art Film.*
			-
		- ### MASTERY OF GENRE
			- Each of us owes an enormous debt to the great story traditions.
			- You must not only respect but master your genre and its conventions.
			- The most valuable insights, however, come from self-discovery; nothing ignites the imagination like the unearthing of buried treasure.
			- Genre study is best done in this fashion:
				- First, list all those works you feel are like yours, both successes and failures. (The study of failures is illuminating...and humbling.)
				- Next get the film and the screenplay if possible.
				- Study the films stop and go, turning pages with the screen, breaking each film down into elements of setting, role, event, and value.
				- Lastly, stack, so to speak, these analyses one atop the other and look down through them asking:
					- What do the stories in my genre always do?
					- What are its conventions of time, place, character, and action?
					- Until you discover answers, the audience will always be ahead of you.
			-
			  > To ^^Anticipate the anticipations^^ of the audience you must master your genre and its conventions.  
			- If a film has been properly promoted, the audience arrives filled with expectancy.
			- We want the audience to settle into their seats, warm and focused with an appetite we intend to satisfy.
			- ^^Positioning of the audience^^ is nothing new.
			- Skillful marketing creates genre expectation.
			- If we botch genre by omitting or misusing conventions, the audience knows instantly and badmouths our work.
		- ### CREATIVE LIMITATIONS
			- Robert Frost said that writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down, for it's the self-imposed, indeed artificial demands of poetic conventions that stir the imagination.
			- Thanks to the poet's Creative Limitation of this rhyme scheme, the poem achieves an intensity it would have lacked had the poet allowed himself the freedom to choose any word he wished.
			- The principle of ^^Creative Limitation^^ calls for freedom within a circle of obstacles.
			- One of our first steps, therefore, is to identify the genre or combination of genres that govern our work, for the story ground that grows the most fruitful ideas is genre convention.
			- Genre conventions are the rhyme scheme of a storyteller's 'poem'.
			- Genre convention is a *Creative Limitation* that forces the writer's imagination to rise to the occasion.
			- With mastery of genre we can guide audiences through rich, creative variations on convention to reshape and exceed expectations by giving the audience not only what it had hoped for but, if we're very good, more than it could have imagined.
			- Consider *Action/Adventure*. Clichés grow on this convention like mold on bread, but when its solution is fresh, the telling is much more enhanced.
		- ### MIXING GENRES
			- Genres are frequently combined to resonate with meaning, to enrich character, and to create verities of mood and emotion.
			- Given over two dozen principle genres, possibilities for inventive cross-breeding are endless.
			- In this way the writer in command of genre may create a type of film the world has never seen.
		- ### REINVENTING GENRES
			- Equally, mastery of genre keeps the screenwriter contemporary.
			- For genres are simply windows on reality, various ways for the writer to look at life.
			- Below are three examples of genre evolution.
			- #### The Western
				- The *Western* began as morality plays set in the 'Old West,' a mythical golden age for allegories of good versus evil.
				- In the 1980s the *Western* modulated into quasi-*Social Drama,* a corrective to racism and violence.
			- #### The Psycho-Drama
				- Clinical insanity was first dramatized in the UFA silent THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.
				- However, as the serial killer began to haunt society's nightmares, genre evolution took *Psycho-Drama* to its second stage, merging it with the *^^Detective Genre^^* into the subgenre known as the *^^Psycho Thriller^^.*
				- In these cops became lay psychiatrists to hunt down psychopaths, and apprehension hinged on the detective's psychoanalysis of the madman.
				- In the 1980s the *Psycho-Thriller* evolved a third time.
				- Once the detective came to terms with his inner demons, apprehending the criminal was almost an afterthought.
				- This evolution was a telling statement about our changing society.
				- These *Psycho-Thrillers* spoke to this threat, to our realization that our toughest ask in life is self-analysis as we try to fathom our humanity and bring peace to the wars within.
				- By 1990 the genre reaches its fourth stage by relocating the psychopath once again, now placing him in your spouse, psychiatrist, surgeon, child, nanny, roomate, neighborhood cop.
				- These films tap communal paranoia, as we discover that the people most intimate in our lives, people we must trust, those we hope will protect us, are maniacs.
			- #### The Love Story
				- The most important question we as when writing a *^^Love Story^^ is:* 'What's to stop them?'
				- For where's the story in a *Love Story?*
				- From 2300 BC this essential convention went unchanged...until the twentieth century launched the romantic revolution.
				- The twentieth century has been an Age of Romance like no other.
				- Resourceful writers unearthed a new and amazing array of forces that oppose love.
				- The enthusiasm for romance that opened this century has turned at its close to deep malaise that brings with it a dark, skeptical attitude toward love.
				- These films speak to a growing sense of the hopelessness, if not the impossibility of a lasting love.
				- To achieve an up-ending some resent films have retooled the genre into the *Longing Story.*
				- Boy-meets-girl has always been an irreducible convention that occurs early in the telling, to be followed by the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of love.
				- It may be that the twentieth century gave birth to, then buried, the Age of Romance.
				- The lesson is this: Social attitudes change.
				- The cultural antenna of the writer must be alert to these movements or risk writing an antique.
				- Through the 1950s however, a love affair across marriages was seen as a painful betrayal.
				- The audience wants to know how it feels to be alive on the knife edge of now.
				- What does it mean to be a human being today?
				- Innovative writers are not only contemporary, they are visionary.
				- They produce works that break convention and take the genres into their next generation.
				- The finest writers are not only visionary, they create classics.
				- Each genres involves crucial human values: love/hate, peace/war, justice/injustice, achievement/failure, good/evil, and the like.
				- With an absolute command of genre Towne and Polanski took their talents to a height few have reached before or since.
			- #### THE GIFT OF ENDURANCE
				- Mastery of genre is essential for yet one more reason: Screen-writing is not for sprinters, but for long-distance runners.
				- All writing is discipline, but screenwriting is a drill sergeant.
				- Ask yourself, therefore, what will keep your desire over those many months?
				- Generally, great writers are not eclectic.
				- Each tightly focuses his oeuvre on one idea, a single subject that ignites his passion, a subject he pursues with beautiful variation through a lifetime of work.
				- Each of these authors found his subject and it sustained him over the long journey of the writer.
				- What is yours?
				- You'll become so tired and bored with writing about yourself or your ideas, you may not finish the race.
				- So, in addition, ask: What's my favorite genre?
				- Then write in the genre you love.
				- Be honest in your choice of genre, for all the reasons for wanting to write, the only one that nurtures us though time is love of the work itself.
	- ## 5 STRUCTURE AND CHARACTER
	  collapsed:: true
		- Plot or Character?
		- Which is more important?
		- This debate is as old as the art.
		- Today both sides continue the debate without a virdict.
		- The reason for the hung jury is simple: The argument is specious.
		- We cannot ask which is more important, structure or character, because structure *is* character; character *is* structure.
		- Yet the argument goes on because of a widely held confusion over two crucial aspects of the fictional role--the difference between *Character* and *Characterization*
		- ### CHARACTER VERSUS CHARACTERIZATION
			- *^^Characterization^^* is the sum of all observable qualities of a human being, everything knowable through careful scrutiny: age and IQ; sex and sexuality; style of speech and gesture; choice of home, car, and dress; education and occupation; personality and nevrosity; value and attitudes---all aspects of humanity we could know by taking notes on someone day in ad day out.
			- The totality of these traits makes each person unique because each of us is a one-of-a-kind combination of genetic givens and accumulated experience.
			- This singular assemblage of traits is *characterization*… but it is not *character.*
			-
			  > **^^TRUE CHARACTER^^ is revealed in the choices a human being makes under pressure--the greater the pressure, the deeper the revelation, the truer the choice to the character's essential nature.**  
			- Beneath the surface of characterization, regardless of appearances, who is this person?
			- The *only* way to know the truth is to witness him make choices under pressure to take one action or another in the pursuit of his desire.
			- As he chooses, he is.
			- Pressure is essential.
			- Choices made when nothing is at risk mean little.
			- If the same character insists on telling the truth when a lie would save his life, then we sense that honesty is at the core of his nature.
			- We may discover that deep within these utterly different characterizations is an identical humanity-both willing to give their lives in a heartbeat for strangers.
			- Whichever way the scene's written, choice under pressure will strip away the mask of characterization, well peer into their inner natures and wish a flash of insight grasp their true characters.
		- ### CHARACTER REVELATION
			- The ^^revelation of true character^^ in contrast or contradiction to characterization is fundamental to all fine storytelling.
			- Life teaches this grand principle: ^^What *seems* is not what *is*.^^
			- No matter what they say, no matter how they comport themselves, the only way we ever come to know  characters in depth is through their choices under pressure.
			- Shallow, nondimensional people exist...but they are boring.
			- Taking the principle further: The revelation of deep character in contrast or contradiction to characterization is fundamental in major characters.
			- Minor roles may or may not need hidden dimensions, but principals must be written in depth--they cannot be at heart what they seem to be at face.
		- ### CHARACTER ARC
			-
			  > Taking the principal further yet: The finest writing not only reveals true character, but ^^arcs^^ or changes the inner nature, for better or worse, over the course of the telling.  
			- This is the play between character and structure seen throughout the history of fiction.
			- The story lays out the protagonist's characterization.
			- Second, we're soon led into the heart of the character.
			- Third, this deep nature is at odds with the outer countenance of the character, contrasting with it, if not contradicting it.
			- Fourth, having exposed the character's inner nature, the story puts greater and greater pressure on him to make more and more different choices.
			- Fifth, by the climax of the story, these choices have profoundly changed the humanity of the character.
		- #### STRUCTURE AND CHARACTER FUNCTIONS
			-
			  > **The function of ^^STRUCTURE^^ is to provide progressively building pressures that force characters into more and more difficult dilemmas where they must make more and more difficult risk-taking choices and actions, gradually revealing their true natures, even down to the unconscious self.**  
			-
			  > **The function of ^^CHARACTER^^ is to bring to the story the qualities of characterization necessary to convincingly act out choices. Put simply, a character must be credible: young enough or old enough, strong or weak, worldly or naïve, educated or ignorant, generous or selfish, witty or dull, in the right proportions. Each must bring to the story the combination of qualities that allows an audience to believe that the character could and would do what he does.**  
			- Structure and character are interlocked.
			- The event structure of a story is created out of the choices that characters make under pressure and the actions they choose to take, while characters are the creatures who are revealed and changed by how they choose to act under pressure.
			- If you change one, you change the other.
			- If you change event design, you have also changed character; if you change deep character, you must reinvent the structure to express the character's changed nature.
			- Whether our instincts work through character or structure, they ultimately meet at the same place.
			- For this reason the phrase 'character-driven story' is redundant.
			- All stories are 'character-driven.'
			- Event design and character design mirror each other.
			- Character cannot be expressed in depth except through the design of story.
			- The key is *appropriateness.*
			- The relative complexity of character must be adjusted to genre.
			- For too many writers it means '^^characterization driven^^,' tissue-thin portraiture in which the mask may be well drawn but deep character is left underdeveloped and unexpressed.
		- #### CLIMAX AND CHARACTER
			- The interlock of structure and character seems neatly symmetrical until we come to the problem of endings.
			- Story is a metaphor for life and life is lived in time.
			- Film, therefore, is temporal art, not plastic art.
			- And the first commandment of all temporal art is: Thou shalt save the best for last.
			- Its ^^Story Climax^^--these culminating moments must be the most gratifying, meaningful experiences of all.
			- A finished screenplay represents, obviously, 100 percent of its author's creative labor.
			- 75 percent or more of our struggles, goes into designing the interlock of deep character to the invention and arrangement of events.
			- And of the overwhelming effort that goes into designing story, 75 percent of that is focused on creating the climax of the last act.
			- The story's ultimate event is the writer's ultimate task.
			- If you fail to make the poetic leap to a brilliant culminating climax, all previous scenes, characters, dialogue, and description become an elaborate typing exercise.
	- ## 6 STRUCTURE AND MEANING
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### AESTHETIC EMOTION
		  collapsed:: true
			- Aristotle approached the question of story and meaning in this way: Why is it, he asked, when we see a dead body in the street we have one reaction, but when we read of death in Homer, or see it in the theatre, we have another?
			- Life idea and emotion come separately.
			- Mind and passions revolve in different spheres of our humanity, rarely coordinated, usually at odds.
			- Your intellectual life prepares you for emotional experiences that then urge you toward fresh perceptions that in turn remix the chemistry of new encounters.
			- The two realms influence each other, but first one, then another.
			- Story is an instrument by which you create such epiphanies at will, the phenomenon known as *^^aesthetic emotion.^^*
			- The source of all art is the human psyche's primal prelinguistic need for the resolution of stress and discord through beauty and harmony, for the use of creativity to revive a live deadened by routine, for a link to reality thorough our instinctive, sensory feel for the truth.
			- Story is first, last, and always the experience of aesthetic emotion--the simultaneous encounter of thought and feeling.
			- When an idea wraps itself around an emotional charge, it becomes all the more powerful, all the more profound, all the more memorable.
			- In short, a story well told gives you the very thing you cannot get from life: meaningful emotional experience. In ^^life^^, ^^experiences^^ become meaningful *with reflection in time.* In ^^art^^, they are meaningful *now, at the instant they happen.*
			- In this sense, story is, at heart, nonintellectual.
			- It does not express ideas in the dry, intellectual arguments of an essay.
			- But this is not to say a story is anti-intellectual.
			- Scholarly acumen sharpens taste and judgement, but we must never mistake criticism for art.
			- Intellectual analysis, however handy, will not nourish the soul.
			- A well-told story neither expresses the clockwork reasonings of a thesis nor vents raging inchoate emotions.
			- It triumphs in the marriage of the rational with the irrational.
			- For a work that's either essential emotional or essentially intellectual cannot have the validity of one that calls upon our subtler faculties of sympathy, empathy, premonition, discernment...or innate sensitivity to the truth.
		- #### PREMISE
		  collapsed:: true
			- Two ideas bracket the creative process: *^^Premise^^,* the idea that inspires the writer's desire to create a story, and *^^Controlling Idea^^,*the story's ultimate meaning expressed through the action and aesthetic emotion of the last act's climax.
			- A Premise, however, unlike a Controlling Idea, is rarely a closed statement.
			- ^^Stanislavski^^ called this the 'Magic if...,' the daydreams hypothetical that floats through the mind, opening the door to the imagination where everything and anything seems possible.
			- But 'What would happen if...' is only one kind of Premise.
			- Anything may premise the writing, even, for example, a glance out a window.
			- Flashes of inspiration or intuition that seem so random and spontaneous are in fact serendipitous.
			- Bland and pacifying writers are a bore.
			- We want unfettered souls with the courage to take a point of view, artists whose insights startle and excite.
			- Finally, it's important to realize that whatever inspires the writing not need stay in the writing.
			- A Premise is not precious.
			- As long as it it contributes to the growth of story, keep it, but should telling take a left turn, abandon the original inspiration to follow the evolving story.
			- The problem is not to start writing, but to keep writing and renewing inspiration.
			- We rarely know where we're going; writing is discovery.
		- #### STRUCTURE AS RHETORIC
		  collapsed:: true
			- Make no mistake: While a story's inspiration may be a dream and its final effect aesthetic emotion, a work moves from an open premise to a fulfilling climax only when the writer is possessed by serious thought.
			- For an artist must have not only ideas to express, but ideas *to prove.*
			- Expressing an idea, in the sense of exposing it, is never enough.
			- The audience must not just understand; it must believe.
			- You want the world to leave your story convinced that yours is a truthful metaphor for life.
			- As you create your story, you create your proof; idea and structure intertwine in a rhetorical relationship.
			-
			  > **^^STORYTELLING^^ is the creative demonstration of truth. A story is the living proof of an idea, the conversion of idea to action. A story's event structure is the means by which you first express then prove your idea...without explanation.**  
			- Master storytellers never explain. They do the art, painfully creative thing--they dramatize.
			- A great story authenticates its ideas solely within the dynamics of its events; failure to express a view of life through the pure, honest consequences of human choice and action is a creative defeat no amount of clever language can salvage.
			- The kind and quality of aesthetic emotion is relative.
			- The *Psycho-Thriller* strives for very strong effects; other forms, like the *Disillusionment* plot or the *Love Story,* want the softer emotions of perhaps sadness or compassion.
			- But regardless of genre, the principle is universal: the story's meaning, whether comic or tragic, must be dramatized in an emotionally expressive Story Climax without the aid of explanatory dialogue.
		- #### CONTROLLING IDEA
		  collapsed:: true
			- *^^Theme^^* has become a rather vague term in the writer's vocabulary.
			- 'Poverty,' 'war,' and 'love,' for example, are not themes; they relate to setting or genre.
			- A true theme is not a word but a sentence--one clear, coherent sentence that expresses a story's irreducible meaning.
			- I prefer the phrase *Controlling Idea*, for like theme, it names a story's root or central idea, but also implies function: The Controlling Idea shapes the writer's strategic choices.
			- It's yet another *Creative Discipline* to guide your aesthetic choices toward what is appropriate or inappropriate to your story, toward what is expressive of your Controlling Idea and may be kept versus what is irrelevant to it and must be cut.
			- The Controlling Idea of a completed story must be expressible in a single sentence.
			- After the Premise is first imagined and the work is evolving, explore everything and anything that comes to mind.
			- A story becomes a kind of living philosophy that the audience members grasp as a whole, in a flash, without conscious thought-a perception married to their life experiences.
			- The more beautifully you shape your work around one clear idea, the more meanings audiences will discover in your film as they take your idea and follow its implications into every aspect of their lives.
			- Conversely, the more ideas you try to pack into a story, the more they implode upon themselves, until the film collapses into a rubble of tangential notions, saying nothing.
			-
			  > **A ^^CONTROLLING IDEA^^ may be expressed in a single sentence describing how and why life undergoes change from one condition of existence at the beginning to another at the end.**  
			- The ^^Controlling Idea^^ has two components: ^^Value plus Cause^^.
			- It identifies the positive or negative charge of the story's critical value at the last act's climax, and it identifies the chief reason that this value has changed to its final sate.
			- The sentence composed from these two elements, Value plus Cause, expresses the core meaning of the story.
			- ^^Value^^ means the primary value in its positive or negative charge that comes into the world or life of your character as a result of the final action of the story.
			- ^^Cause^^ refers to the primary reason that the life or world of the protagonist has turned to its positive or negative value.
			- Working back from the ending to the beginning, we trace the chief cause deep within the character, society, or environment that has brought this value into existence.
			- A complex story may contain many forces for change, but generally one cause dominates the other.
			- A ^^story of substance^^ also expresses *why* its world or protagonist has ended on its specific value.
			- The Controlling Idea is the purest form of a story's meaning, the how and why of change, the vision of life the audience members carry away into their lives.
			- #### Meaning and Creative Process
				- How do you find your story's Controlling Idea?
				- The creative process may begin anywhere.
				- You might start in the middle, the beginning, near the end.
				- As your fictional world and characters grow, events interlink and the story builds.
				- Then comes the crucial moment when you take the leap and create the Story Climax.
				- This climax of the last act is a final action that excites and moves you, that feels complete and satisfying.
				- The Controlling Idea is now at hand.
				- Looking at your ending, ask: As a result of this climactic action, what value, positively or negatively charged, is brought into the world of my protagonist?
				- Next, tracing backwards from this climax, digging to the bedrock, ask: What is the chief cause, force, or means by which this value is brought into his world?
				- The sentence you compose from the answers to those two questions becomes your Controlling Idea.
				- The story tells you its meaning; you do not dictate meaning to the story.
				- You do not draw action from idea, rather idea from action.
				- For no matter your inspiration, ultimately the story embeds its Controlling Idea within the final climax, and when this event speaks its meaning, you will experience one of the most powerful moments in the writing life--*^^Self-Recognition^^:* The Story Climax mirrors your inner self, and if your story is from the very best sources within you, more often than not you'll be shocked by what you see reflected in it.
				- Beautiful story design is a combination of the subject found, the imagination at work, and the mind loosely but wisely executing the craft.
			- #### Idea Versus Counter-Idea
				- Paddy Chayefsky once told me that when he finally discovered his story's meaning, he'd scratch it out on a scrap of paper and tape it to his typewriter, so that nothing going through the machine wouldn't in one way or another express his central theme.
				- With a clear statement of Value plus Cause staring him in the eye, he could resist intriguing irrelevancies and concentrate on unifying the telling around the story's core meaning.
				- ^^By 'one way or another,' Chayefsky meant he'd forge the story dynamically, moving it back and fourth across the opposing charges of its primary values.^^
				- His improvisations would be so shaped that sequence after sequence alternately expressed the positive, then negative dimension of his Controlling Idea.
				- In other words, he fashioned his stories by playing *^^Idea^^* against *^^Counter-Idea^^.*
				-
				  > **^^PROGRESSIONS^^  build by moving dynamically between the positive and negative charges of the values at stake in the story.**  
				- From the moment of inspiration you reach into your fictional world in search of design.
				- You have to build a bridge of story from the opening to ending, a progression of events that spans from Premise to Controlling Idea.
				- These events echo the contradictory voices of one theme.
				- Sequence by sequence, often scene by scene, the positive Idea and its negative Counter-Idea argue, so to speak, back and fourth, creating a dramatized dialectical debate.
				- At climax one of these two voices wins and becomes the story's Controlling Idea.
				- The positive and negative assertions of the same idea contest back and fourth through the film, building in intensity, until at *Crisis* they collide head-on in a last impasse.
				- Out of this rises the Story Climax, in which one or the other idea succeeds.
				- Whichever of the two is dramatized in the final climactic action becomes the Controlling Idea of Value plus Cause, the purest statement of the story's conclusive and decisive meaning.
				- This rhythm of Idea versus Counter-Idea is fundamental and essential to our art.
				- This simple dynamic can become very complex, subtle, and ironic.
				-
		- #### DIDACTISM
		  collapsed:: true
			- A note of caution: In creating the dimensions of your story's 'argument,' take great care to build the power of both sides.
			- Compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it.
			- If your film ends on the Counter-Idea then amplify the sequences that lead the audience to feel the Idea will win out.
			- If your film ends on the Idea then enhance the sequences expressing the Counter-Idea.
			- Do not slant your 'argument.'
			- In this balanced telling your victory of good over evil now rings with validity.
			- The danger is this: When your premise is an idea you feel you must prove to the world, and you design your story as an undeniable certification of that idea, you set yourself on the road to didactism.
			- In your zeal to persuade, you will stifle the voice of the other side.
			- ^^Didacticism^^ results from the naïve enthusiasm that fiction can be used like a scalpel to cut out the cancers of society.
			- Starting with an idea is certain to produce didactic work...but that's the risk.
			- As a story develops you must willingly entertain opposite, even repugnant ideas.
			- The finest writers have dialectical, flexible minds that easily shift points of view.
			- They see the positive, the negative, and all shades of irony , seeking the truth of these views honestly and convincingly.
			- Ultimately, they express what they deeply believe, but not until they have allowed themselves to weigh each living issue and experience all its possibilities.
			- No one can achieve excellence as a writer without being something of  a philosopher and holding strong convictions.
			- The trick is not to be a slave to your ideas, but to immerse yourself in life.
			- The proof of your vision is not how well you can assert your Controlling Idea, but its victory over the enormously powerful forces that you array against it.
			- A great work is living metaphor that says, 'Life is like *this.'*
			- The classics, down through the ages, give us not solutions but lucidity, not answers but poetic candor; they make inescapably clear the problems all generations must solve to be human.
			-
		- #### IDEALIST, PESSIMIST, IRONIST
			- Writers and the stories they tell can be usefully divided into three grand categories, according to the emotional charge of their Controlling Idea.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669172994544_0.png)
			- #### Idealistic Controlling Ideas
				- '^^Up-ending' stories^^ expressing the optimism, hopes, and dreams of mankind, a positively charged vision of the human spirit; life as we wish it to be.
			- #### Pessimistic Controlling Ideas
				- '^^Down-ending' stories^^ expressing our cynicism, our sense of loss and misfortune, a negatively charged vision of civilization's decline, of humanity's dark dimensions; life as we dread it to be but know it so often is.
				- These films are rare because the pessimistic vision is a hard truth that some people wish to avoid.
			- #### Ironic Controlling Ideas
				- '^^Up/down ending'^^ stories expressing our sense of the complex, dual nature of existence, a simultaneously charged positive and negative vision; life at its most complete and realistic.
				- Here optimism/idealism and pessimism/cynicism merge.
				- The *Idealistic* melds with the *Pessimistic* and results in an ironic Controlling Idea.
				- What follows are two examples of Controlling Ideas whose ironies have helped define the ethics and attitudes of contemporary American society.
				- First, the^^positive irony^^ :
					-
					  > **The compulsive pursuit of contemporary values-success, fortune, fame, sex, power--will destroy you, but if you see this truth in time and throw away your obsession, you can redeem yourself.**  
				- Second, the ^^negative irony^^:
					-
					  > **If you cling to your obsession, your ruthless pursuit will achieve your desire, then destroy you.**  
			- #### On Irony
				- The ^^effect of irony^^ on an audience is that wonderful reaction, 'Ah, life is just like that.'
				- We recognize that idealism and pessimism  are at the extremes of experience, that life is rarely all sunshine and strawberries, nor is it all doom and drek; it is both.
				- No matter how we try to plot a straight passage through life, we sail on the tides of irony.
				- Reality is relentlessly ironic, and this is why stories that end in irony tend to last the longest through time, travel the widest in the world, and draw the greatest love and respect from audiences.
				- This is also why, of the three possible emotional charges at climax, irony is by far the most difficult to write.
				- It demands the deepest wisdom and the highest craft for three reasons.
				- First, it's though enough to come up with either a bright, idealistic ending or a sober, pessimistic climax that's satisfying and convincing.
				- But an ironic climax is a single action that makes both a positive and negative statement.
				- How to do two in one?
				- Second, how to say both clearly? Irony doesn't mean ambiguity.
				- Ambiguity is a blur; one thing cannot be distinguished from another.
				- A true irony is honestly motivated.
				- Stories that end by random chance, doubly charged or not, are meaningless, not ironic.
				- Third if at climax the life situation of the protagonist is both positive and negative, how to express it so that the two charges remain separated in the audience's experience and don't cancel each other out, and you end up saying nothing?
		- #### MEANING AND SOCIETY
			- Once you discover your Controlling Idea, respect it.
			- Never allow yourself the luxury of thinking, 'It's just entertainment.'
			- In 388 BC Plato urged the city fathers of Athens to exile all poets and storytellers.
			- They are a threat to society, he argued.
			- Writers deal with ideas, but not in the open, rational manner of philosophers.
			- Instead, they conceal their ideas inside the seductive emotions of art.
			- Storytellers, Plato insisted, are dangerous people.
			- He was right.
			- Authoritative personalities, like Plato, fear the threat that comes not from idea, but emotion.
			- Those in power never want us to feel.
			- Thought can be controlled and manipulated, but emotion is willful and unpredictable.
			- Artists threaten authority by exposing lies and inspiring passion for change.
			- This is why when tyrants seize power, their firing squads aim at the heart of the writer.
			- I believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity, to uplift the spriits of society or even express our inner being.
			- We have ^^only one responsibility^^: *to tell the truth.*
			- For although an artist may, in his private life, lie to others, even to himself, when he creates he tells the truth; and in a world of lies and liars, an honest work of art is always an act of social responsibility.

- # PART 3 - THE PRINCIPLES OF STORY DESIGN
	-
	  > *When forced to work within a strict framework the imagination is taxed to its utmost-and will produce its richest ideas. Given total freedom to work is likely to sprawl.*  
	  -T.S. Elliot  
	- ## 7 THE SUBSTANCE OF STORY
	  collapsed:: true
		- What is the '^^substance' of story?^^
		- In all other arts the answer is self-evident.
		- For at the nucleus of a story is a 'substance,' like the energy swirling in an atom, that's never *directly* seen, heard, or touched, yet we know it and feel it.
		- The stuff of story is alive but intangible.
		- To understand the substance of story and how it performs, you need to view your work from the inside out, from the center of your character, looking *out* at the world through your character's eyes, experiencing the story as if you were the living character yourself.
		- To slip into this subjective and highly imaginative point of view, you need to look closely at this creature you intend to inhabit, a ^^*character.*^^
		- Or more specifically, a ^^*protagonist.*^^
		- For although the protagonist is a character like any other, as the central and essential role, he embodies all aspects of character in absolute terms.
		- ### THE PROTAGONIST
			- Generally, the protagonist is a single character.
			- A story, however, could be driven by a duo, a trio, an entire class of people, or the proletariat, create a massive *^^plural-protagonist^^.*
			- For two or more characters to form a Plural-Protagonist, two conditions must be met:
				- First, all individuals in the group share the same desire.
				- Second, in the struggle to achieve this desire, they mutually suffer and benefit.
				- If one has a success, all benefit.
				- If one has a setback, all suffer.
				- Within a Plural-Protagonist, motivation, action, and consequence are communal.
			- A story may, on the other hand, be *Multiprotagonist.*
			- Here, unlike the Plural-Protagonist, characters pursue separate and individual desires, suffering and benefiting independently.
			- ^^Multiprotagonist^^ stories become ^^Multiplot^^ stories.
			- Rather than driving the telling through focused desire of a protagonist, either a single or plural, these works weave a number of smaller stories, each with its own protagonist, to create a dynamic portrait of a specific society.
			- The protagonist need not be human.
			- Anything that can be given a free will and the capacity to desire, take action, and suffer the consequences can be a protagonist.
			- It's even possible in rare cases, to switch protagonists halfway through a story.
			- But no matter whether the story's protagonist is single, multi or plural, no matter how he is characterized, all protagonists have certain hallmark qualities, and the first is *willpower.*
			-
			  > **A ^^PROTAGONIST^^ is a willful character.**  
			- Other characters may be dogged, even inflexible, but the protagonist in particular is a willful being.
			- A protagonist's willpower may be less than that of the biblical Job, but powerful enough to sustain desire through the conflict and ultimately take actions that create meaningful and irreversible change.
			- What's more, the true strength of the protagonist's will behind a passive characterization.
			- A story cannot be told about a protagonist who doesn't want anything, who cannot make decisions, whose actions effect no change at any level.
			-
			  > **The ^^PROTAGONIST^^ has a conscious desire.**  
			- Rather, the protagonist's will impels a known desire.
			- The protagonist has a need or goal, *an object of desire,* and knows it.
			- In either case, the protagonist knows what he wants, and for many characters a simple, clear, conscious desire is sufficient.
			-
			  > **The ^^PROTAGONIST^^ may also have a self-contradictory unconscious desire.**  
			- However, the most memorable, fascinating characters tend to have not only a conscious but an unconscious desire.
			- Although these complex protagonists are unaware of their subconscious need, the audience senses it, perceiving in them an inner contradiction.
			- The conscious and unconscious desires of a multidimensional protagonist contradict each other.
			- What he believes he wants is the antithesis of what he actually but unwittingly wants.
			-
			  > **The ^^PROTAGONIST^^ has the capacities to pursue the Object of Desire convincingly.**  
			- The protagonist's characterization must be appropriate.
			- He needs a believable combination of qualities in the right balance to pursue his desires.
			- But the character's desires must be realistic enough in relationship to his will and capacities for the audience to believe that he could be doing what they see him doing and that he has a chance for fulfillment.
			-
			  > **The ^^PROTAGONIST^^ must have at least a chance to attain his desire.**  
			- An audience has no patience for a protagonist who lacks all possibility of realizing his desire.
			- The reason is simple: No one believes this of his own life.
			- In the words of Henry David Thoreau, 'The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,' that most people waste their precious time and die with the feeling they've fallen short of their dreams.
			- As honest as this painful insight may be, we cannot allow ourselves to believe it.
			- Instead, we carry hope to the end.
			- Hope, after all, is not unreasonable.
			- It's simply hypothetical.
			- A protagonist, therefore, who's literally hopeless, who hasn't even the minimal capacity to achieve his desire, cannot interest us.
			-
			  > **The ^^PROTAGONIST^^ has the will and capacity to pursue the object of his conscious and/or unconscious desire to the end of the line, to the human limit established by setting and genre.**  
			- The art of story is not about the middle ground, but about the pendulum of existence swinging to the limits, about life lived in its most intense states.
			- The audience, therefore, expects the story teller to be an artist of vision who can take his story to those distant depths and ranges.
			-
			  > **A ^^STORY^^ must build to a final action beyond which the audience cannot imagine another.**  
			- The audience wants to be taken to the limit, to where all questions are answered, all emotion satisfied--the end of the line.
			- The protagonist takes us to the limit.
			- Each story must find closure for itself.
			-
			  > **The ^^PROTAGONIST^^ must be empathetic; he may or may not be sympathetic.**  
			- ^^Sympathetic^^ means likable.
			- Empathy, however, is a more profound response.
			- ^^Empathetic^^ means 'like me. '
			- Deep within the protagonist the audience recognizes a certain shared humanity.
			- In that moment of recognition, the audience suddenly and instinctively wants the protagonist to achieve whatever it is he desires.
			- The unconscious logic of the audience runs like this: '^^This character is like me.^^ Therefore, I want him to have whatever it is he wants, because if I were he in those circumstances, I'd want the same thing for myself.'
			- If not, the audience/story bond is broken.
		- ### THE AUDIENCE BOND
			- The ^^audience's emotional involvement^^ is held by the glue of empathy.
			- The gift of story is the opportunity to live lives beyond our own, to desire and struggle in a myriad of worlds and times, at all the various depths of our being.
			- Empathy, therefore, is absolute, while sympathy is optional.
			- The audience identifies with deep character, with innate qualities revealed through choice under pressure.
			- At first glance creating empathy does not seem difficult.
			- Indeed, in the hands of the greatest writers, even the most unsympathetic character can be made empathetic.
			- On the other hand, in recent years many films, despite otherwise splendid qualities, have crashed on these rocks because they failed to create an audience bond.
			- Audiences always disassociate themselves from hypocrites.
		- ### THE FIRST STEP
			- When you sit down to write, the musing begins: 'How to start? What would my character do?'
			- Your character, indeed all characters, in the pursuit of any desire, at any moment in story, will always take the minimum, conservative action *from his point of view.*
			- In life we take an action consciously or unconsciously, thinking or sensing within to this effect.
			- This is the great mass of experience, hour by hour, in life.
			- BUT NEVER, EVER IN A STORY.
			- ^^The grand difference between story and life^^ is that in story we cast out the minutiae of daily existence in which human beings take actions expecting a certain enabling reaction from the world, and, more or less, get what they expect.
			-
			  > **In ^^story^^, we concentrate on that moment, and only that moment, in which a character takes an action expecting a useful reaction from his world, but instead the effect of his action is to provoke forces of antagonism. The world of the character reacts differently than expected, more powerfully than expected, or both.**  
		- ### THE WORLD OF CHARACTER
			- This chapter seeks the substance of story as seen from the perspective of a writer who in his imagination has placed himself at the very center of the character he's creating.
			- The ^^'center' of a human being^^, that irreducible particularity of the innermost self, is the awareness you carry with you twenty-four hours a day that watches you do everything you do, that chides you when you get thigs wrong, or compliments you on those rare occasions when you get things right.
			- It's the deep observer that comes to you when you're going through the most agonizing experience of your life, collapsed on the floor, crying your heart out...that little voice that says, 'Your mascara is running.'
			- This ^^inner eye^^ is you: your identity, your ego, the conscious force of your being.
			- Everything outside this subjective core is the objective world of a character.
			- A character's world can be imagined as a series of concentric circles surrounding a core of raw identity or awareness, circles that mark the levels of conflict in a character's life.
			- The ^^inner circle^^ or level is his own self and conflicts arising from the elements of his nature: mind, body, emotion.
			- When, for example, a character takes an action, his mind may not react the way he anticipates.
			- His body may not react as he imagined.
			- It may not be strong enough or deft enough for a particular task.
			- And we all know how emotions betray us.
			- The closest circle of antagonism in the world of a character is his own being: feelings and emotions, mind and body, all or any of which may or may not react from one moment to the next the way he expects.
			- As often as not, we are our own worst enemies.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669188269961_0.png)
			- #### THE THREE LEVELS OF CONFLICT
				- The ^^second circle^^ inscribes personal relationships, unions of intimacy deeper than the social role.
				- Social convention assigns the outer roles we play.
				- Not until we set the conventional role aside do we find the true intimacy of family, friends, and lovers--who then do not react the way we expect and become the second level of personal conflict.
				- The ^^third circle^^ marks the level of extra-personal conflict--all the sources of antagonism outside the personal: conflict with the social institutions and individuals--government/citizen, church/worshipper; corporation client; conflict with individuals--cop/criminal/victim, boss/worker, customer/waiter, doctor/patient; and conflict with both man-made and natural environments--time space, and every object in it.
				-
		- ### THE GAP
			-
			  > **^^STORY^^ is born in that place where the subject and objective realms touch.**  
			- The protagonist seeks an object of desire beyond his reach.
			- Consciously or unconsciously he chooses to take a particular action, motivated by the thought or feeling that this act will cause the world to react in a way that will be a positive step toward achieving his desire.
			- From his subjective point of view the action he has chosen seems minimal, conservative, yet sufficient to effect the reaction he wants.
			- But the moment he takes this action, the objective realm of his inner life, personal relationships, or extra-personal world, or a combination of these, react in a way that's more powerful or different than he expected.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669188714953_0.png)
			- This reaction from his world blocks his desire, thwarting him and bending him further from his desire than he was before he took this action.
			- Rather than evoking cooperation from his world, his action provokes forces of antagonism that open ^^the *gap*^^ between his subjective expectation and the objective result, between what he thought would happen when took his action and what in fact does happen between his sense of probability and true necessity.
			- Very human being acts, from one moment to the next, knowingly or unknowingly, on his sense of ^^probability^^, on what he expects, in all likelihood, to happen when he takes an action.
			- We ^^behave^^ according to what we believe to be the truth of ourselves, the people around us, and the environment.
			- But this is a truth we cannot know absolutely.
			- It's what we ^^*believe*^^ to be true.
			- We also believe we're free to make any decision whatsoever to take any action whatsoever.
			- But every choice and action we make and take, spontaneous or deliberate, is rooted in the sum total of our experience, in what happened to us in actuality, imagination, or dream to that moment.
			- We then choose to ^^act^^ based on what this gathering of life tells us will be the probable reaction from our world.
			- It's only then, when we take action, that we discover^^necessity^^ .
			- Necessity is about truth.
			- Necessity is what in fact happens when we act.
			- The ^^truth^^ is known -*and can only be known* when we take action into the depth and breadth of our world and brave its reaction.
			- This ^^reaction is the truth^^ of our existence at the precise moment, no matter what we believed the moment before.
			- ^^Necessity^^ is what must and does actually happen, as opposed to probability, which is what we hope to expect to happen.
			- As in life, so in fiction.
			- When objective necessity contradicts a character's sense of probability, a gap suddenly cracks open in the fictional reality.
			- This gap is the point where the subjective and objective realms collide, the difference between anticipation and result, between the world as the character perceived it before acting and the truth he discovers in action.
			- Once the ^^gap in reality^^ splits open, the character, being willful and having capacity, sense or realizes that he cannot get what he wants in a minimal, conservative way.
			- He must gather himself and struggle through this gap to take a ^^second action^^.
			- This next action is something the character would not have wanted to do in the first case because it not only demands more willpower and forces him to dig more deeply into his human capacity, but most important, *the second action puts him at risk.*
			- He now stands to lose in order to gain.
			-
		- ### THE GAP IN PROGRESSION
			- The protagonist's first action has aroused forces of antagonism that block his desire and spring open a gap between anticipation and result, disconfirming his notions of reality, putting him in greater conflict with his world, at even greater risk.
			- But the ^^resilient human mind^^ quickly remakes reality into a larger pattern that incorporates this disconfirmation, this unexpected reaction.
			- Now he takes ^^a second, more difficult and risk-taking action^^, an action consistent with his revised vision of reality, an action based on his new expectations of the world.
			- But again his action provokes forces of antagonism, splitting open a gap in his reality.
			- So he adjusts to the unexpected, ups the ante yet again and decides to take an action that he feels is consistent with his amended sense of things.
			- He reaches even more deeply into his ^^capacities and willpower^^, puts himself at greater risk, and takes a ^^third action.^^
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669193146600_0.png)
			- Over and over again in a progress, rather than cooperation, his actions provoke forces of antagonism, opening gaps in his reality.
			- ^^This pattern^^ repeats on various levels to the end of the line, to a final action beyond which the audience cannot imagine another.
			- These cracks in moment-to-moment reality mark the difference between the dramatic and the prosaic, between action and activity.
			- ^^True action^^ is physical, vocal, or mental movement that opens gaps in expectation and creates significant change.
			- Mere^^activity^^  is behavior in which what is expected happens, generating either no change or trivial change.
			- But the gap between expectation and result is far more than a matter of cause and effect.
			- In the most profound sense, ^^the break between^^ the cause as it seemed and the effect as it turns out marks the point where the human spirit and the world meet.
			- On one side is the world as we believe it to be, on the other side is reality as it actually is.
			- In this gap is the ^^nexus of story,^^ the caldron that cooks our stories.
			- Here the writer finds the most powerful, life-bending moments.
			- The only way we can reach this crucial junction is by working from the inside out.
		- ### WRITING FROM THE INSIDE OUT
			- Like anthropologists, we could, for example, discover social and environmental truths through careful observation.
			- But the one crucial dimension we would not create is ^^*emotional truth.*^^
			- The only reliable source of emotional truth is yourself.
			- If you stay outside your characters, you inevitably write emotional clichés.
			- When a scene is emotionally meaningful to us, we can trust that it'll be meaningful to the audience.
			- By creating work that moves us, we move them.
			-
		- ### CREATING WITHIN THE GAP
			- In writing out what actors call 'inner monologues' I've put this well paced scene into ultra-slow motion, and given words to what would be flights of feeling or flashes of insight.
			- Nonetheless, that's how it is at the desk.
			- We put each and every moment under a microscope of thinking, rethinking, creating, recreating as we weave through our characters' moments, a maze of unspoken thoughts, images, sensations, and emotions.
			- ^^Writing from the inside out^^, however, does not mean that we imagine a scene from one end to the other locked in a single character's point of view.
			- Rather the writer shifts points of view.
			- He feels within his own emotions a specific human reaction and imagines the character's next reaction.
			- Now the writer's problem is this: how to progress the scene?
			- To ^^build a next beat^^, the writer must move out of the character's subjective point of view and take an objective look at the action he just created.
			- The action anticipates a certain reaction from the character's world.
			- But that must not occur.
			- Instead, the writer must pry open the gap.
			- To do so, he asks the question writers have been asking themselves since time began: 'What is the opposite of that?"
			- Writers are by instinct ^^dialectical thinkers^^.
			- As ^^Jean Cocteau^^ said, 'The spirit of creation is the spirit of contradiction-the breakthrough of appearances toward an unknown reality.'
			- Rather, peel back the skin of life to find the hidden, the unexpected, the seemingly inappropriate--in other words, ^^the truth^^.
			- And you will find your truth in the gap.
			- Remember you are the God of your universe.
			- You know your characters, their minds, bodies, emotions, relationships, world.
			- Once you've created an honest moment from one point of view, you move around your universe, even into the inanimate, looking for another point of view so you can invade that, create an unexpected reaction, and splinter open the cleft between expectation and result.
			- Having done this, you then go back into the mind of the first character, and find your way to a new emotional truth by asking again: 'If I were this character under these *new* circumstances, what would I do?'
			- Finding your way to that reaction and action, you then step right out again, asking: 'And what is the opposite of *that?*'
			-
			  > **Fine writing emphasizes ^^REACTIONS.^^**  
			- Many of the actions in any story are more or less expected.
			- The richest and most satisfying pleasures of all are found in stories that focus on the ^^*reactions*^^ that events cause and the *insight gained.*
			- Once you've imagined the scene, beat by beat, gap by gap, you write.
			- The words on the page allow the reader to plunge into each gap, seeing what you dreamed, feeling what you felt, learning what you understood until, like you, the reader's pulse pounds, emotions flow, and meaning is made.
		- ### THE SUBSTANCE AND ENERGY OF STORY
			- The answers to the questions that began this chapter should now be clear.
			- The stuff of story is not its words.
			- The ^^substance of story^^ is the gap that splits open between what a human being expects to happen when he takes an action and what really does happen; the rift between expectation and result, probability and necessity.
			- ^^To build a scene,^^ we constantly break open these breaches in reality.
			- As to^^the source of energy in story,^^  the answer is the same: the gap.
			- The ^^audience empathizes^^ with the character, vicariously seeking his desire.
			- As a charge of electricity leaps from pole to pole in a magnet, so the spark of life ignites across the gap between the self and reality.
			- With this flash of energy we ignite the power of story and move the heart of the audience.
	- ## 8 THE INCITING INCIDENT
	  collapsed:: true
		- A ^^story is a design in five parts:^^ ^^*The Inciting Incident,,*^^ the first major event of the telling is the primary cause for all that follows, putting into motion the other four elements--*^^Progressive Complications^^, ^^Crisis^^,^^Climax^^ , ^^Resolution^^.*
		- To understand how the Inciting Incident enters into and functions within the work, let's step back to take a more comprehensive look at *^^setting,^^* the physical and social world in which it occurs.
		- ### THE WORLD OF THE STORY
			- We've defined *setting* in terms of period, duration, location, and level of conflict.
			- These four dimensions frame the story's world, but to *inspire the multitude of creative choices you need to tell an original,* cliché-free story, and you must fill that frame with a depth and breadth of detail.
			- Below is a list of ^^general questions we ask of all stories^^.
			- Beyond these, each work inspires a unique list of its own, driven by the writer's thirst for insight.
			- *^^How do my characters make a living?^^*
			- We spend a third or more of our lives at work, yet rarely see scenes of people doing their jobs.
			- The reason is simple: Most work is boring.
			- That's why in the professional genres--*Courtroom, Crime, Medical--*we focus on only those moments when work causes more problems than it solves.
			- Nonetheless, to get inside a character, we must question all aspects of their twenty-four-hour day.
			- Not only work, but how do they play? Pray? Make love?
			- *^^What are the politics of my world?^^*
			- Politics is the name we give to the orchestration of power in any society.
			- Whenever human beings gather to do anything, there's always an uneven distribution of power.
			- No matter how we try to level inequalities, applying egalitarian theories of all kinds, human societies are stubbornly and inherently pyramidal in their arrangement of power.
			- Even when writing about a household, question its politics, for like any other social structure, a family is political.
			- Love relationships are political.
			- ^^*What are the rituals of my world?*^^
			- In all corners of the world life is bound up in ritual.
			- We create a ritual for every activity, not only for public ceremony but for our very private rites.
			- heaven help the person who rearranges my organization of toiletries around the bathroom basin.
			- How do your characters take meals?
			- Eating is a different ritual everywhere around the world.
			- ^^*What are the values in my world?*^^
			- ^^*What is the genre of combination of genres?*^^
			- As with setting, genres surround the writer with creative limitations that must be kept or brilliantly altered.
			- ^^*What are the biographies of my characters?*^^
			- From the day they were born to the opening scene, how has life shaped them?
			- ^^*What is the Backstory?*^^
			- This is an oft-misunderstood term.
			- *^^Backstory^^* is the set of significant events that occurred in the characters' past that the writer can use to build his story's progressions.
			- We landscape character biographies, planting them with events that become a garden we'll harvest again and again.
			- ^^*What is my cast design?*^^
			- Nothing in a work of art is there by accident.
			- Ideas may come spontaneously, but we must weave them consciously and creatively into the whole.
			- Each role must fit a purpose, and the first principle of cast design is polarization.
			- Between the various roles we devise a network of contrasting or contradictory attitudes.
			- If the ideal cast sat down for dinner and something happened, whether as trivial as spilled wine or as important as a divorce announcement, from each and every character would come a separate and  distinctively different reacion.
			- Each is an individual with a character-specific view of life, and the disparate reaction of each contrasts with all others.
			- If two characters in your cast share the same attitude and react in kind to whatever occurs, you must either collapse the two into one, or expel one from the story.
			- When characters react the same, you minimize opportunities for conflict.
			- Instead, the writer's strategy must be to maximize these opportunities.
		- ### AUTHORSHIP
			- When research of settings reaches the saturation point, something miraculous happens.
			- Your story takes on a unique atmosphere, a personality that sets it apart from every other story ever told, no matter how many millions there have been through life time.
			- Human beings have told one another stories since they sat around the fire in caves, and every time the story teller uses the art in its fullest, his story, like a portrait by a master painter, becomes one of a kind.
			- Like the stories you're striving to tell, you want to be one of a kind, recognized and respected as an original.
			- In your quest, consider these three words: 'author,' 'authority,' 'authenticity,'
			- First, 'author.'
			- 'Author' is a title we easily give novelists and playwrights, rarely screenwriters.
			- But in the strict sense of 'originator,' the screenwriter, as creator of setting, characters, and story, is an *^^author^^.*
			- A true author, no matter the medium, is an artist with godlike knowledge of his subject, and the proof of his authorship is that his pages smack of *^^authority^^.*
			- What a rare pleasure it is to open a screenplay and immediately surrender to the work, giving over emotion and concentration because there is something ineffable between and under the lines that says: *'This writer knows. I'm in the hands of an authority.*
			- And the effect of writing with authority is *^^authenticity^^.*
			- Two principles control the emotional involvement of an audience.
			- First, ^^empathy^^: identification with the protagonist that draws us into the story, vicariously rooting for our own desire in life.
			- Second, ^^authenticity^^: *We must believe,* or as Samuel Taylor Coleridge suggested, we must willingly suspend our disbelief.
			- The moment it lacks credibility, empathy dissolves and we feel nothing.
			- Authenticity, howver, does not mean actuality.
			- Giving a story contemporary milieu is no guarantee of authenticity; authenticity mean san internally consistent world, true to itself in scope, depth,  and detail.
			- As ^^Aristotle^^ tells us: 'For the purposes of story a convincing impossibility is preferable to an unconvincing possibility.'
			- Authenticity has nothing to do with reality.
			- A story set in a world that could never exist could be absolutely authentic.
			- ^^Story arts^^ do not distinguish between reality and the various nonrealities of ^^fantasy^^, ^^dream^^, and ^^ideality^^.
			- The creative intelligence of the writer merges all these into a unique yet convincing fictional reality.
			- ^^Authenticity^^ depends on the ^^'telling detail.^^'
			- When we use a few selected details, the audience's imagination supplies the rest, completing a credible whole.
			- An audience believes as long as we don't give them a reason to doubt.
			- Beyond ^^physical^^ and ^^social^^ ^^detail^^, we must also create ^^emotional^^ authenticity.
			- ^^Authorial research^^ must pay off in believable character behavior.
			- The writer whose knowledge of subject has taught him exactly what to stress and expand versus what to lay down quietly and subtly will stand out from the thousands of others who always hit the same note.
			- ^^Originality^^ lies in the struggle for authenticity, not eccentricity.
			- A ^^personal style,^^ in other words, cannot be achieved self-consciously.
			- Rather, when you ^^authorial knowledge^^ of setting and character meets your ^^personality^^, the choices you make and the arrangements you create out of this mass of material are unique to you.
			- Your work becomes what you are, an original.
		- ### THE INCITING INCIDENT
			- When an Inciting Incident occurs it must be a dynamic fully developed event, not something static or vague.
			-
			  > **The ^^INCITING INCIDENT^^ radically upsets the balance of forces in he protagonist's life.**  
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669247100084_0.png)
			- As the story begins, the protagonist is living a life that's more or less in balance.
			- Then, perhaps suddenly but in any case decisively, an event occurs that radically upsets its balance, swinging the value-charge of the protagonist's reality either to the negative or the positive.
			- In most cases, the Inciting Incident is a single event that either happens directly to the protagonist or is caused by the protagonist.
			- Occasionally, an Inciting Incident needs ^^two events^^: a ^^setup^^ and a ^^payoff^^.
			- If the logic of an Inciting Incident requires a setup, the writer cannot delay the payoff--at least not for very long--and keep the protagonist ignorant of the fact that his life is out of balance.
			- A story is not a sandwich of episodic slices of life between two halves of an Inciting Incident.
			-
			  > **The protagonist must react to the Inciting Incident.**  
			- Given the infinitely variable nature of protagonists, however, any reaction is possible.
			- The protagonist responds to the sudden negative or positive charge in the balance of life in whatever way is appropriate to character and world.
			- A refusal to act, however cannot last for very long, even in the most passive protagonists of minimalist Nonplots.
			- For we all wish some reasonably sovereignty over our existence, and if an event radically upsets our sense of equilibrium and control, what would we want?
			- What does anyone, including our protagonist, want?
			- ^^To restore balance.^^
			- Therefore, the Inciting Incident first throws the protagonist's^^life out of balance^^ , then arouses in him the desire to restore that balance.
			- Out of this need--often quickly, occasionally with deliberation--the protagonist next conceives of an ^^Object of Desire^^: something physical or situational or attitudinal that he feels he lacks or needs to put the ship of life on an even keel.
			- Inciting Incident propels the protagonist into an active pursuit of this object or goal.
			- And for many stories or genres this is sufficient: An event pitches the protagonist's life out of kilter, arousing ^^conscious desire^^ for something he feels will set things right, and he goes after it.
			- But for those protagonists we tend to admire the most, the Inciting Incident arouses not only a conscious desire, but an ^^unconscious^^ one as well.
			- These ^^complex characters^^ suffer intense inner battles because these two desire are in direct conflict with each other.
			- No matter what the character consciously thinks he wants, the audience sense or realizes that deep inside he unconsciously wants the very opposite.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669247655519_0.png)
		- ### THE SPINE OF THE STORY
			- The energy of a protagonist's desire forms the critical element of design knowledge as the ^^*Spine*^^ of the story (AKA *Through-line* or *Super-objective*).
			- The Spine is the deep desire in and effort by the protagonist to restore the balance of life.
			- It's the primary unifying force that holds all other story elements togehter.
			- For no matter what happens on the surface of the story, each scene, image, and word is ultimately an aspect of the Spine, relating, causally or thematically, to this core of desire and action.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669265408905_0.png)
			- If the protagonist has no unconscious desire, then his conscious objective becomes the Spine.
			- If, on the other hand, the protagonist has an unconscious desire, this becomes the Spine of the story.
			- An unconscious desire is always more powerful and durable, with roots reaching to the ^^protagonist's innermost self^^.
			- When an ^^unconscious desire drives^^ the story, it allows the writer to create a far more complex character who may repeatedly change his conscious desire.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669265531846_0.png)
			-
		- #### THE QUEST
			- From the point of view of the writer looking from the Inciting Incident 'down the Spine' to the last act's Climax, in spite of all we've said about genres and the various shapes from Archplot to Antiplot, in truth there's only one story.
			- In essence we have told one another the same tale, one way or another, since the dawn of humanity, and that story could be usefully called ^^*the Quest.*^^
			- All stories take the form of a Quest.
			-
			  > **For better or worse, an event throws a character's life out of balance, arousing in him the conscious and/or unconscious desire for that which he feels will restore balance, launching him on a Quest for his Object of Desire against forces of antagonism (inner, personal, extra-personal). He may or may not achieve it. This is story in a nutshell.  
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669265817626_0.png)
			- The essential form of a story is simple.
			- When a writer takes up this seemingly simple form, he discovers how incredibly complex it is, how inordinately difficult to do.
			- To understand ^^the Quest form^^ of your story you need only identify your protagonist's Object of Desire.
			- By looking into the heart of the protagonist and discovering his desire, you begin to see ^^the arc of your story^^, the Quest on which the Inciting Incident sends him.
		- #### DESIGN OF THE INCITING INCIDENT
			- An ^^Inciting Incident happens in only one of two ways^^: randomly or causally, either by coincidence or by decision.
			- If by ^^decision^^, it can be made by the protagonist.
			- If made by ^^coincidence^^, it may be tragic.
			- By choice or accident; there are no other means
			- The Inciting Incident of the ^^Central Plot^^ must happen onscreen--not in the Backstory.
			- Each ^^sublot^^ has its own Inciting Incident, which may or may not be onscreen, but the presence of the audience at the Central Plot's Inciting Incident is crucial to story design for two reasons.
			- First, when the audience experiences an Inciting Incident, the film's ^^Major Dramatic Question^^, a variation on 'How will this turn out?' is provoked to mind.
			- The Central Plot's Inciting Incident is the 'big hook.'
			- It must occur onscreen because this is the event that incites and captures the audience's curiosity.
			- Hunger for the answer to the Major Dramatic Question grips the audience's interest, holding it to the last act's climax.
			- Second, witnessing the Inciting Incident projects an image of the ^^Obligatory Scene^^ into the audience's imagination.
			- The Obligatory Scene (AKA Crisis) is an event the audience knows it must see before the story can end.
			- The scene will bring the protagonist into a confrontation with the most powerful forces of antagonism in his question, forces stirred to life by the Inciting Incident that will gather focus and strength through the course of the story.
			- The scene is called 'obligatory' because having teased the audience into anticipating this moment, the writer is obligated to keep his promise and show it to them.
			- Unlike action genres that bring the Obligatory Scene immediately and vividly to mind, other more interior genres hint at this scene in Inciting Incident, then like a photo negative in acid solution, slowly bring it into focus.
			- When I say the audience 'knows' an Obligatory Scene awaits it doesn't know in an objective, checklist sense.
			- If this event is mishandled, the audience knows intuitively when something is missing.
			- A lifetime of story ritual has taught the audience to anticipate that the forces of antagonism provoked at the Inciting Incident will build to the limit of human experience, and that the telling cannot end until the protagonist is in some sense face to face with these forces at their most powerful.
			- Linking a story's Inciting Incident to its ^^Crisis^^ is an aspect of *^^Foreshadowing^^,* the arrangement of early events to prepare for later events.
			- In fact, every choice you main-genre, setting, character, mood--foreshadows.
			- The primary component of foreshadowing, however, is the projection of the Obligatory Scene (Crisis) into the audience's imagination by the Inciting Incident.
		- #### LOCATING THE INCITING INCIDENT
			- Where to place the Inciting Incident in the overall story design?
			- As a rule of thumb, the first major event of the Central Plot occurs within the ^^first 25 percent of the telling^^.
			- This is a useful guide, no matter what medium.
			- The standard for a two-hour feature film is to locate the Central Plot's Inciting Incident somewhere within the first half-hour.
			- If the ^^Central Plot's Inciting Incident^^ arrives much later than fifteen minutes into the film, boredom becomes a risk.
			- Therefore, while the audience waits for the main plot, a subplot may be needed to engage their interest.
			-
			  > **Bring in the ^^Central Plot's Inciting Incident^^ as soon as possible...but not until the moment is ripe.**  
			- An Inciting Incident must 'hook' the audience, a deep and complete response.
			- Their response must not only be emotional, but rational.
			- This event must not only pull at audience's feelings, but cause them to ask the Major Dramatic Question and imagine the Obligatory Scene.
			- Therefore, the location of the Central Plot's Inciting Incident is found in the answer to this question: How much does the audience need to know about the protagonist and his world to have a full response?
			- In some stories, nothing.
			- If an Inciting Incident is archetypal in nature, it requires no setup and must occur immediately.
			- Every story world and cast are different, therefore, every Inciting Incident is a different event located at a different point.
			- If it^^arrives to soon^^ , the audience may be confused.
			- If it ^^arrives too late^^, the audience may be bored.
			- The instant the audience has a sufficient understanding of character and world to react fully, execute your Inciting Incident.
			- The exact moment is found as much by feeling as by analysis.
			- If we writers have a common fault in design and placement of the Inciting Incident, it's that we habitually delay the Central Plot while we pack our opening sequences with exposition.
			- We consistently underestimate knowledge and life experience of the audience, laying out or characters and world with tedious detail the filmgoer has already filled in with common sense.
			- Bergman knows that his urbane audience quickly grasps the implications behind best-seller, doctor, boarding school, and mental hospital...and that less is always more.
		- ### THE QUALITY OF INCITING INCIDENT
			- What quality of event need an Inciting Incident be?
			- The quality of the Inciting Incident (for that matter, any event) must be germane to the world, characters, and genre surrounding it.
			- Once it is conceived, the writer must concentrate on its funciton.
			- ^^Does the Inciting Incident radically upset the balance of forces in the protagonist's life?^^
			- ^^Does it arouse in the protagonist the desire to restore balance?^^
			- ^^Does it inspire him the conscious desire for that object, material or immaterial, he feels would restore the balance?^^
			- ^^In a complex protagonist, does it also bring to life an unconscious desire that contradicts his conscious need?^^
			- ^^Does it launch the protagonist on a quest for his desire? Does it raise the Major Dramatic Question in the mind of the audience?^^
			- ^^Does it project an image of the Obligatory Scene?^^
		- ### CREATING THE INCITING INCIDENT
			- The ^^Climax^^ of the last act is far and away the most difficult scene to create: It's the soul of the telling.
			- The second most difficult scene to write is the ^^Central Plot's Inciting Incident.^^
			- We rewrite this scene more than any other.
			- So here are some questions to ask that should help bring it to mind.
			- What is the worst possible thing that could happen to my protagonist?
			- How could that turn out to be the best possible thing that could happen to him?
			- Or: What's the best possible thing that could happen to my protagonist?
			- How could it become the worst possible thing?
			- A story may turn more than one cycle of this pattern.
			- We stretch toward the 'best' and 'worsts' because story-when it is art-is not about the middle ground of human experience.
			- The impact of the Inciting Incident creates our opportunity to reach the limits of life.
			- No matter how subtle or direct, it must upset the status quo of the protagonist and jolt his life from its existing pattern, so that chaos invades the character's universe.
			- Out of this upheaval, you must find, at Climax, a resolution, for better or worse, that rearranges this universe into a new order.
	- ## 9 ACT DESIGN
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### PROGRESSIVE COMPLICATIONS
			- The second element of the five-part design is ^^*Progressive Complications:*^^ that great sweeping body of story that spans from Inciting Inciting Incident to Crisis/Climax of the final act.
			- To complicate means to make life difficult for characters.
			- To complicate progressively means to generate more and more conflict as they face greater and greater forces of antagonism, creating a succession of events that passes points of no return.
			- ### Points of No Return
			  collapsed:: true
				- The Inciting Incident launches the protagonist on a quest for a conscious or unconscious Object of Desire to restore life's balance.
				- To begin the ^^pursuit of his desire^^, he takes a minimum, conservative action to provoke a positive response from his reality.
				- But the ^^effect of his actions^^ is to arouse forces of antagonism from inner, personal, or social/environmental Levels of Conflict that block his desire, cracking open the Gap between expectation and result.
				- When the Gap opens, the audience realizes that this is a point of no return.
				- Minimal efforts won't work.
				- The character can't restore the balance of life by taking lesser actions.
				- Henceforth, all action like the character's first effort, actions of minor quality and magnitude, must be eliminated from the story.
				- Realizing he's at risk, the protagonist draws upon greater willpower and capacity to struggle through this gap and take a second, more difficult action.
				- But again the effect is to provoke forces of antagonism, opening a second gap between expectation and result.
				- The audience now senses that this too is a ^^point of no return.^^
				- Moderate actions like the second won't succeed.
				- Therefore, all actions of this magnitude and quality must be eliminated.
				- At greater risk, the character must adjust to his changed circumstances and take an action that demands even more willpower and personal capacity, expecting or at least hoping for a helpful or manageable reaction from his world.
				- But once more the gap flies open as even more powerful forces of antagonism react to his third action.
				- Again, the audience recognizes that this is yet another point of no return.
				- The more extreme actions won't get the character what he wants, so these too are canceled out of consideration.
				- ^^Progressions^^ build by drawing upon greater and greater capacities from characters, demanding greater and greater willpower from them, putting them at greater and greater risk, constantly passing points of no return in terms of the magnitude or quality of action.
				-
				  > **A story must not retreat to actions of lesser quality or magnitude, but more progressively forward to a final action beyond which the audience cannot imagine another.**  
				- The only way to keep a film's current flowing and rising is research--imagination, memory, fact.
				- Generally, a feature-length Archplot is designed around forth to sixty scenes that conspire into twelve to eighteen sequences that build into three or more acts that top one another continuously to the end of the line.
				- ^^To create forty to sixty scenes^^ and *not repeat yourself,* you need to invent hundreds.
				- For if you devise only the forty to sixty scenes needed to fill the 120 pages of a screenplay, your work is certain to be antiprogressive and repetitious.
			- ### The Law of Conflict
			  collapsed:: true
				- When the protagonist steps out of the Inciting Incident, he enters a world governed by the ^^Law of Conflict.^^ To wit: *Nothing moves forward in a story except through conflict.*
				- ^^Conflict^^ is storytelling what sound is to music.
				- Both story and music are temporal arts, and the single most difficult task of the temporal artist is to hook our interest, hold our interrupted concentration, then *carry us through time without an awareness of the passage of time.*
				- *The Music of Story is Conflict.*
				- As long as conflict engages our thoughts and emotions we travel through the hours unaware of the voyage.
				- The Law of Conflict is more than an aesthetic principle; it is the soul of story.
				- Story is metaphor for life, and to be alive is to be in seemingly perpetual conflict.
				- As ^^Jean-Paul Sartre^^ expressed it, the essence of reality is scarcity, a universal eternal lacking.
				- Time, as ^^Heidegger^^ observed, is the basic category of existence.
				- We live in its ever-shrinking shadow, and if we are to achieve anything in our brief being that lets us die without feeling we've wasted our time, we will have to go into heady conflict with the forces of scarcity that deny our desires.
				- Writers who cannot grasp the truth of our transitory existence, who have been misled by the counterfeit comforts of the modern world, who believe that life is easy once you know how to play the game, give conflict a false inflection.
				- Their ^^scripts fail for one of two reasons^^: either a glut of meaningless and absurdly violent conflict, or a vacancy of meaningful and honestly expressed conflict.
				- Writers at these extremes fail to realize that while the ^^*quality of*^^ conflict changes as it shifts from level to level, *the^^quantity of^^  conflict in life is constant.*
				- Something is always lacking.
				- When we remove conflict from one level of life, it amplifies ten times over on another level.
				- An artist intent on creating works of lasting quality comes to realize that life isn't about subtle adjustments to stress, or hyper-conflicts of master criminals with stolen nuclear devices holding cities for ransom.
				- Life is about the ultimate questions of finding love and self-worth, or bringing serenity to inner chaos, of the titanic social inequities everywhere around us, of time running out.
				- Life is conflict.
				- That is its nature.
				- The writer must decide where and how to orchestrate this struggle.
			- ### Complication Versus Complexity
			  collapsed:: true
				- To complicate a story the writer builds conflict progressively to the end of the line.
				- Conflict may come, as we've seen before, from any one, two, or all three levels of antagonism.
				- To simply complicate a story means to place all conflict on only one of these three levels.
				- **COMPLICATION: CONFLICT AT ONLY ONE LEVEL**
					- **INNER CONFLICT -- Stream of Consciousness**
					- **PERSONAL CONFLICT -- Soap Opera**
					- **EXTRA-PERSONAL CONFLICT - Action/Adventure, Farce**
				- Complicated films share two hallmarks.
				- The first is a large cast.
				- If the writer restricts the protagonist to ^^social conflict^^, he'll need, as the advertising declares, 'a cast of thousands.'
				- Second, a complicated film needs multiple sets and location.
				- If the writer progresses via ^^physical conflict^^, he must keep changing the environment.
				- Stores that are complicated only on the level of personal conflict are known as *Soap Opera,* an open-ended combination of *Domestic Drama* and *Love Story* in which every character in the story has an intimate relationship with every other character in the story--a multitude of family, friends, and lovers, all needed sets to house them: living rooms, bedrooms, offices, nightclubs, and hospitals.
				- Stories that are complicated only on the level of ^^inner conflict^^ are not films, plays, or conventional novels. They're prose works in the *Stream of Consciousness* genre, a verbalization of the inscape of thought and feeling.
				- Again a large cast.
				- Even though we're populated with the memories and imaginings of everyone he has ever met or could hope to meet.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669546681758_0.png)
				- ^^To achieve complexity^^ the writer brings his characters into conflict of all three levels of life, often simultaneously.
				- Unless it's your ambition to write in the *Action* genres, *Soap Opera,* or *Stream of Consciousness* prose, my advice to most writers is to design relatively simple but complex stories.
				- 'Relatively simple' doesn't mean simplistic.
				- It means beautifully turned and told stories restrained by these two principles:
				- Do not proliferate characters; do not multiply locations.
				- Rather than hopscotching through time, space, and people, discipline yourself to a reasonably contained cast and world, while you concentrate on creating a rich complexity.
			- ### Act Design
				- As a symphony unfolds in three, four, or more movements, so story is told in movements called *^^acts^^*--the macro-structure of story.
				- Beats, changing patters of human behavior, build scenes.
				- Ideally, every scene becomes a ^^Turning Point^^ in which the values at stake swing from the positive to the negative or the negative to the positive, creating significant but *minor* change in their lives.
				- A series of scenes build a sequence that culminates in a scene that has *^^moderate^^* impact on the characters, turning or changing values for better or worse to a greater degree than any sense.
				- A series of sequences builds an act that climaxes in a scene that creates a *major*reversal in the characters' lives, greater than any sequence acomplished.
				- In the *^^Poetics^^*, Aristotle deduces that there is a relationship between the size of the story-how long it takes to read or perform-and the number of major Turning Points necessary to tell it: the longer the work, the more major reversals.
				- In other words, in his polite way, Aristotle is pleading, 'Please don't bore us. Don't make us sit for hours on those hard marble seats listening to choral chants and laments while nothing actually happens.'
				- Following ^^Aristotle's principle^^: A story can be told in one act--a series of scenes that shape a few sequences that build up from one major reversal, ending the story.
				- But if so, it must be brief.
				- This is the prose short story, the one-act play, or the student or experimental film of perhaps five to twenty minutes.
				- A story can be told in two acts: two major reversals and it's over.
				- But again it must be relatively brief: the sitcom, the novella, or the hour-length play.
				- But when a story reaches a certain magnitude--the feature film, an hour-long TV episode, the full-length play, the novel-three acts is the minimum.
				- Not because of an artificial convention, but to serve a profound purpose.
				- In our effort to satisfy the audience's need, to tell stories that touch the innermost
				- No matter the setting or and outermost sources of life, two major reversals are never enough.
				- No matter the setting or scope of the telling, no matter how international and epic or intimate and interior, *three* major reversals are the necessary minimum for a full-length work of narrative art to reach the end of the line.
				- Consider these rhythms: Things were bad, then they were good--end of story.
				- Or things were good, then they were bad---end of story.
				- Or things were bad, then they were very bad---end of story.
				- Or things were good, then they were very good--end of story.
				- In all four cases we feel something's lacking.
				- We know that the second event, whether positively or negatively charged, is neither the end nor the limit.
				- Even if the second event kills the cast: Things were good (or bad), then everyone died--end of story--it's not enough.
				- The third turn is missing and we know we haven't touched the limit until at least one more major reversal occurs.
				- Therefore, ^^the three-act story rhythm^^ was the foundation of story art for centuries before Aristotle noted it.
				- But it's only a foundation, not a formula, so I'll begin with it, then delineate some of its infinite variations.
				- The proportions I'll use are the rhythms of the feature film, but in principle they apply equally to the play and novel.
				- Again, I caution that these are approximations, not formulas.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669547288748_0.png)
				- ^^The first act^^, the opening movement, typically consumes about 25 percent of the telling, the Act One Climax occurring between twenty and thirty minutes into a 120-minute film.
				- The last act wants to be the shortest of all.
				- In the ideal last act we want to give the audience a sense of acceleration, a swiftly rising action to Climax.
				- If the writer tries to stretch out the last act, the pace of acceleration is almost certain to slow in mid-movement.
				- So last acts are generally brief, twenty minutes or less.
				- Let's say a 120-minute film places its Central Plot's Inciting Incident in the first minute, the Act One Climax at the thirty-minute point, has an eighteen minute Act Three, and a two-minute Resolution to FADE OUT.
				- This rhythm creates an ^^Act Two^^ that's seventy minutes long.
				- If an otherwise well-told story bogs down, that's where it'll happen--as the writer sloshes through the swamps of the long second act.
				- There are two possible solutions: ^^Add subplots or more acts^^.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669547686420_0.png)
				- ^^Subplots^^ have their own act structure, although usually brief.
				- Between the central plot's three act design above, let's weave three subplots: a one-act Subplot A with an Inciting Incident twenty-five minutes into the film, climaxing and ending at sixty minutes: a two-act Subplot B with an Inciting Incident at fifteen minute point, an Act One Climax at forty-five minutes; a three-act Subplot C is with its Inciting Incident happening inside the Inciting Incident of the Central Plot (lovers meet, for example, and start a subplot in the same scene cops discover the crime that launches the central plot), an Act One Climax at fifty minutes, an Act Two Climax at ninety minutes, and a third act climaxing inside the Central Plot's last Climax (the lovers decide to marry the same scene that they apprehend the criminal).
				- Although the Central Plot and three subplots may have up to four different protagonists, an audience could empathize with all of them, and each subplot raises its own Major Dramatic Question.
				- So the interest and emotions of the audience are hooked, held, and amplified by four stories.
				- What's more, the three subplots have five major reversals that fall between the Central Plot's Act One and Act Two climaxes--more than enough storytelling to keep the overall film progressing, deepen the involvement of the audience, and tighten the soft belly of the Central Plot's second act.
				- How then does the writer solve the problem of the long second act?
				- By creating more acts.
				- *The three-act design is the minimum.*
				- If the writer builds progressions to a major reversal at the halfway point, he breaks the story into four movements with no act more than thirty or forty minutes long.
				- A film could have a ^^Shakespearean rhythm^^ of five acts; seven acts; eight; or more.
				- These films turn a major reversal every fifteen or twenty minutes, decisively solving the long second act problem.
				- But the five- to eight-act design is the exception, for the cure of one problem is the cause of others.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669548090149_0.png)
				-
				  > **FIRST, the ^^multiplication of act climaxes^^ invites clichés.**  
				- Generally, a three-act story requires ^^four memorable scenes^^: the Inciting Incident that opens the telling, and an Act One, Act Two, and Act Three Climax.
				- When the writer multiplies acts, he's forcing the invention of five, perhaps six, seven, eight, nine, or more brilliant scenes.
				- This becomes a creative task beyond his reach, so he resorts to the clichés that infest so many action films.
				-
				  > **Second, ^^the multiplication of acts^^ reduces the impact of climaxes and results in repetitiousness.**  
				- If every scene screams to be heard, we go deaf.
				- When too many scenes strive to be powerhouse climaxes, what should be major becomes minor, repetitious, running downhill to a halt.
				- This is why a three-act Central Plot with subplots has become kind of a standard.
				- It fits the creative powers of most writers, provides complexity, and avoids repetition.
			- ### Design Variations
				- First, ^^stories vary according to^^ the number of major reversals in the telling.
				- Second, the ^^shapes of stories vary according to^^ the placement of the Inciting Incident.
				- Conventionally, the Inciting Incident occurs very early in the telling and progressions build to a major reversal at the Act One Climax twenty or thirty minutes later.
				- This patter requires the writer to place two major scenes in the first quarter of the film.
				- However, the Inciting Incident may enter late as twenty, thirty, or more minutes into the telling.
				- ROCKY, for example, has a very late-arriving Central Plot Inciting Incident.
				- The effect of this is the Inciting Incident becomes, in effect, the first act Climax and serves two purposes.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669548434843_0.png)
				- This, howver, cannot be done fo the convenience of the writer.
				- The only reason to delay the entrance of the Central Plot is the audience's need to know the protagonist at length so it can fully react to the Inciting Incident.
				- Story must be told to hold the audience while it waits for a late-arriving Central Plot to ripen.
				- The rhythm of act movements is established by the location of the Central Plot's Inciting Incident.
				- ^^Act structure^^, therefore, varies enormously.
				- The number of placements of the ^^major reversals^^ for both main plot and subplot are choices made in the creative play between artist and material, depending on quality and number of protagonists, sources of antagonism, genre, and, ultimately the personality and worldview of the writer .
			- ### False Ending
				- Occasionally, especially in *Action* genres, at the Penultimate Act Climax or within the last act's movement, the writer creates a *^^False Ending:^^* a scene so seemingly complete we think for a moment that the story is over.
				- For most films, however, the False Ending is inappropriate.
				- Instead, the Penultimate Act Climax should intensify the Major Dramatic Question: '*Now* what's going to happen?'
			- #### Act Rhythm
				- Repetitiousness is the enemy of rhythm.
				- The ^^dynamics of story^^ depend on the alternation of its value-charges.
				- For example, the two most powerful scenes in a story are the last two act climaxes.
				- Onscreen they're often only ten or fifteen minutes apart.
				- Therefore, they cannot repeat the same charge.
				- Working back form the ^^Penultimate Climax^^ to the opening scene, previous act climaxes are further apart, often with subplot and sequence climaxes coming into emotional play between them, creating a unique rhythm of positive and negative turnings.
				- Consequently, although we know that the Ultimate and Penultimate Climaxes must contradict each other, from story to story there is no way to predict the charges of the other act climaxes.
				- Each film finds its own rhythm and all variations are possible.
			- #### Subplots and Multiple Plots
				- A subplot receives less emphasis and screentime than a Central Plot, but often it's the invention of a subplot that lifts a troubled screenplay to a film worth making.
				- Multiplot films, on the other hand, never develop a Central Plot; rather they weave together a number of stories of subplot size.
				- Between the Central Plot and its subplots or between the various plot lines of a Multiplot, four possible relationships come into play.
				-
				  > **A ^^subplot^^ may be used to contradict the Controlling Idea of the Central Plot and thus enrich the film with irony.**  
				-
				  > **Subplots may be used to resonate the Controlling Idea of the Central Plot and enrich the film with variations on a theme.**  
				- The ^^principle of thematic contradiction^^ and variation is the genesis of Multiplot films.
				- A Multiplot has no Central Plot Spine to structurally unify the telling.
				- Instead, a number of plot lines either cross-cut or connect via a motif such as the twenty-dollar bill that passes from story to story.
				- What then holds the film together? An idea.
				- The ^^Multiplot^^ frames an image of a particular society, but, unlike the static Nonplot, it weaves small stories around an idea, so that these group photos vibrate with energy.
				- Multiplot gives the writer the best of both worlds: a portrait that captures the essence of a culture or community along with ample narrative drive to compel interest.
				-
				  > **When the Central Plot's Inciting Incident must be delayed, a setup subplot may be needed to open the storytelling.**  
				- A setup subplot dramatizes the Central Plot's exposition so that it's absorbed in a fluid, indirect manner.
				-
				  > **A subplot may be used to complicate the Central Plot.**  
				- This fourth relationship is the most important: use the subplot as an additional source of antagonism.
				- These subplots add dimension to characters, create comic or romantic relief from the tensions or violence of the Central Plot, but their primary purpose is to make life more difficult for the protagonist.
				- The balance of emphasis between the Central Plot and the subplot has to be carefully controlled, or the writer risks losing focus on the primary story.
				- A setup subplot is particularly dangerous in that it may mislead the audience as to genre.
				- Additionally, if the protagonists of the Central Plot and subplot are not the same character, care must be taken not to draw too much empathy to the subplot's protagonist.
				- If a ^^subplot^^ doesn't ^^thematically contradict^^ or resonate the Controlling Idea of the main plot, if it doesn't set up the introduction of the main plot's Inciting Incident, or complicate the action on the main plot, if it merely runs alongside, it will split the story down the middle and destroy its effect.
				- The audience understands the principle of aesthetic unity.
				- It knows that every story element is there because of the relationship it strikes to every other element.
				- This relationship, structural or thematic, holds the work together.
				- If the audience can't find it, it'll disengage from the story and consciously try to force a unity.
				- When this fails, it sits in confusion.
				- A novelist can enter a character's mind and in first- or third-person delineate inner conflict directly into prose description.
				- The screenwriter cannot.
				- The screenwriting is the art of making the mental *^^physical^^.*
				- We create visual correlatives for inner conflict-not dialogue or narration to describe ideas and emotions, but images of character choice and action to indirectly and ineffably express the thoughts and feelings within.
				- Therefore, the interior life of a novel must be reinvented for the screen.
				- Faced with irreconcilable choices, such as pace versus empathy, the wise writer redesigns the story to preserve what's vital.
				- You're free to break or bend convention, but for one reason only: *to put something more important in its place.*
	- ## 10 SCENE DESIGN
	  collapsed:: true
		- This chapter focuses on the components of scene design: *Turning Points, Setups/Payoffs, Emotional Dynamics, and Choice.*
		- ### TURNING POINTS
			- A scene is a story in miniature-an action through conflict in a unity or continuity of time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character's life.
			- In theory there's virtually no limit to a scene's length or locations.
			- A scene may be infinitesimal.
			- No matter locations or length, a scene is unified around desire, action, conflict, and change.
			- In each scene a character pursues a desire related to his immediate time and place.
			- But this ^^*Scene-Objective*^^ must be an aspect of his ^^*Super-Objective*^^, or Spine, the story-long quest that spans from Inciting Incident to Story Climax.
			- Within the scene, the character acts on his Scene-Objective by choosing under pressure to take on action or another.
			- However, from any or all levels of conflict comes a reaction he didn't anticipate.
			- The effect is to crack open the gap between expectation and result, turning his other fortunes, inner life, or both from the positive tot he negative or the negative to the positive in terms of values the audience understands are at risk.
			- A scene causes change in a minor, albeit significant way.
			- A *^^Sequence Climax^^* is a scene that causes a moderate reversal-change with more impact than a scene.
			- An *^^Act Climax^^* is a scene that causes a major reversal-change with greater impact than Sequence Climax.
			- Accordingly, we never write a scene that's merely a flat static display of exposition; rather we strive for this ideal: to create a story design in which every scene is a minor, moderate, or major *^^Turning Point.^^*
			- The effects of Turning Points are fourfold: *^^surprise^^, ^^increased curiosity^^, ^^insight^^, and ^^new direction^^.*
			- When a gap opens between expectation and result, it jolts the audience with ^^surprise^^.
			- The world has reacted in a way neither character nor audience had foreseen.
			- This moment of shock instantly provokes curiosity as the audience wonders 'Why?'
			- The nimble and perceptive mind of the audience finds these answers in a flash of understanding.
			- The question '^^Why^^?' propels it back through the story, and what it's seen so far instantly clicks into  a new configuration; it experiences a rush of insight into character and world, a satisfying layer of hidden truth.
			- ^^Insight^^ adds to ^^curiosity^^.
			- The writer must now satisfy the curiosity he's created.
			- From each point of changed value, he must move his story in a new direction to create Turning Points yet to come.
			- ### The Question of Self-Expression
				- A storyteller puts a friendly arm around the audience, saying 'Let me show you something.'
				- The storyteller leads us into expectation, makes us think we understand, then cracks open reality, creating surprise and curiosity, sending us back through his story again and again.
				- ^^To tell story is to make a promise^^: If you give me your concentration, I'll give you surprise followed by the pleasure of discovering life, its pains and joys, at levels and in directions you have never imagined.
				- And most important, this must be done with such seeming ease and naturalness that we lead the audience to these discoveries as if spontaneously.
				- The effect of a beautifully turned moment is that filmgoers experience a rush of knowledge *as if they did it for themselves.*
				- ^^Insight^^ is the audience's reward for paying attention, and a beautifully designed story delivers this pleasure scene after scene after scene.
				- We apply our literary talent with vividness and skill, so that when a beautifully written scene is acted, the audience is carried willingly and pleasurably through our Turning Points.
				- ^^Language^^ is a tool for self-expression and must never become a decorative end of its own.
				- Even exquisite, perceptive prose cannot substitute for the global insight that floods the mind when we match our life experiences against an artist's well-paced setup.
		- ### SETUPS/PAYOFFS
			- To express our vision scene by scene we crack open the surface of our fictional reality and send the audience back to gain insight.
			- These insights, therefore, must be shaped into *^^Setups^^* and *^^Payoffs^^.*
			- To^^set up^^  means to layer in knowledge; to pay off means to close the gap by delivering that knowledge to the audience.
			- When the gap between expectation and result propels the audience back through the story seeking answers, it can only find them if the writer has prepared or planted these insights into the work.
			- Setups must be handled with great care.
			- They must be ^^planted^^ in such a way that when the audience first sees them, they have one meaning, but with a rush of insight, they take on a second, more important meaning.
			- In fact, that a ^^single setup^^ may have meanings hidden to a ^^third and fourth level^^.
			- Setups must be planted firmly enough so that when the audience's mind hurls back, they're remembered.
			- If setups are too subtle, the audience will miss the point.
			- If too heavy-handed, the audience will see the Turning Point coming a mile away.
			- ^^Turning Points fail^^ when we overprepare the obvious and underprepare the unusual.
			- Additionally, the firmness of the setup must be adjusted to the target audience.
			- We set up more prominently for youth audiences, because they're not as story literate as middle-aged filmgoers.
			- Once the setup closes the gap, that payoff will, in all probability, become yet another setup for payoffs ahead.
			- The juggling act of setting up, paying off, setting up again and paying off again often sparks our must creative flashes.
			- In story, unlike life, you can always go back and fix it.
			- You can set up what may seem absurd and make it rational.
			- ^^Reasoning^^ is secondary and post creativity.
			- Primary and preconditional to everything else is ^^imagination^^-the willingness to think any crazy idea, to let images that may or may not make sense find their way to you.
			- Nine out of ten will be useless.
			- Yet one illogical idea may put butterflies in your belly.
			- Logic is child's play.
			- Imagination takes you to the screen.
		- ### EMOTIONAL TRANSITIONS
			- We render the precise experience necessary to^^*cause* an emotion^^ , then take the audience through that experience.
			- For Turning Points not only to deliver insight, they create the dynamics of emotion.
			- The understanding of how we create the audience's emotional experience begins with the realization that ^^there are only two emotions^^--pleasure and pain.
			- Each has its variations: joy, love, happiness, rapture, fun...etc.
			- But at heart life only gives us one or the other.
			- As audience, we experience an emotion when the telling takes us through a ^^transition of values^^.
			- ^^First^^, we must empathize with the character.
			- ^^Second^^, we must know what the character wants and want the character to have it.
			- ^^Third^^, we must understand the values at stake in the character's life.
			- Within these conditions, a change in values moves our emotions.
			- Next, the story must turn in a new direction to shape a transition from positive to negative that's deeper than his previous penniless state.
			- Now the story must turn in yet another direction.
			- Story must create these dynamic alterations between positive and negative emotions in order to obey the *^^Law of Diminishing Returns.^^*
			- The Law of Diminishing Returns, true in life as well as in story, is this: *The more often wee experience something, the less effect it has.*
			- ^^Emotional experience^^, in other words, cannot be repeated back-to-back with effect.
			- The first time we experience an emotion or sensation it has its full efffect.
			- If we try to repeat this experience immediately, it has half or less than half of its full effect.
			- If we go straight to the same emotion for the third time, it not only doesn't have the original effect, it delivers the opposite effect.
			- Although comedy may seem the exception to this principle in that we often seem to laugh repeatedly, its not.
			- Laughter is not an emotion.
			- Joy is an emotion.
			- Laughter is a criticism we hurl at something we find ridiculous or outrageous.
			- It may occur inside any emotion, from terror to love.
			- Nor do we laugh without relief.
			- ^^A joke has two parts^^: setup and punch.
			- The ^^setup^^ raises the tension in the audience, through danger, sex, the scatological-a host of taboos-then the ^^punch^^ explodes laughter.
			- This is the secret to comic timing: when is the setup ripe to hit the punchline or gag?
			- The comic sense this intuitively, but one thing he learns objectively is that he can't deliver punch, punch, punch, without wearing out his welcome.
			- There is, however, one exception: a story can go from positive to positive or negative to negative, *if* the contrast between these events is so great, in retrospect the first takes on shades of the opposite.
			- If the contrast between emotional charges is great, events can move form positive to positive without sentimentality, or from negative to negative without forced seriousness.
			- The Law of Diminishing Returns is true of everything in life, except sex, which seems endlessly repeatable with effect.
			- Once a transition of value creates an emotion, ^^feeling^^ comes into play.
			- Although they're often mistaken for each other, feeling is not emotion.
			- ^^Emotion^^ is a short-term experience that peaks and burns rapidly.
			- ^^Feeling^^ is a long-term, pervasive, sentient background that colors whole days, weeks, even years of our lives.
			- Indeed, a specific feeling often dominates a personality.
			- Each of the core emotions in life-pleasure and pain-has many variations.
			- For, like adding pigment to a pencil sketch or an orchestra to a melody, feeling makes emotion specific.
			- In film, feeling is known as ^^mood^^.
			- ^^Mood^^ is created in the film's text: the quality of light and color, tempo of action and editing, casting, style of dialogue, production design, and musical score.
			- The sum of all these textural qualities creates a particular mood.
			- In general, mood, like setups, is a form of foreshadowing, a way of preparing or shaping the audience's anticipations.
			- Moment by moment, however, while the dynamic of the scene determines whether the emotion it causes is positive or negative, the mood makes the emotion specific.
			- The arc of the scene, sequence, or act determines the ^^basic emotion^^.
			- Mood makes it specific.
			- *But mood will not substitute for emotion.*
			- When we want mood experiences, we go to concerts or museums.
			- When we want meaningful emotional experience, we go to the storyteller.
		- ### THE NATURE OF CHOICE
			- A Turning point is centered in the choice of a character makes under pressure to take one  action or another in the pursuit of desire.
			- Human nature dictates that each of us will always choose the 'good' or the 'right' *as we perceive the 'good' or the 'right.'*
			- Therefore, if a character is put into a situation where he must choose between a clear good versus a clear evil, or right versus wrong, the audience, understanding the character's point of view, will know in advance how the character will choose.
			-
			  > **The ^^choice^^ between good and evil or between right and wrong is no choice at all.**  
			- If we do not understand that much about human nature--that a human being is only capable of acting toward the right or the good as he has come to believe it or rationalize it--then we understand very little.
			- Good/evil, right/wrong choices are dramatically obvious and trivial.
			- *^^True choice^^ is ^^dilemma^^.*
			  id:: 63842c91-8287-4907-9bda-9e1733177388
			- It occurs in two situations.
			- ^^First^^, a *choice between irreconcilable goods:* From the character's view two things are desirable, he wants both, but the circumstances are forcing him to choose only one.
			- ^^Second^^, *a choice between the lesser of two evils:* From the character's view two things are undesirable, he wants neither, but circumstances are forcing him to choose one.
			- How a character chooses in a ^^true dilemma^^ is a powerful expression of his humanity and of the world in which he lives.
			- Writers since ^^Homer^^ have understood the principle of dilemma, and realized that the story of a two-sided relationship cannot be sustained, that the simple conflict between Character A and Character B cannot be told to satisfaction.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669606685880_0.png){:height 117, :width 420}
			- ^^A two-sided conflict^^ is not a dilemma but vacillation between the positive and negative.
			- It isn't only tediously repetitious, but it has no ending.
			- To construct and create genuine choice, we must frame ^^a three-sided situation.^^
			- As in life, meaningful decisions are triangular.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669606774482_0.png)
			- The moment we add C we generate ample material to avoid repetition.
			- First, to the three possible relationships between A and B: positive/negative/neutral, love/hate/indifference, for example we add the same three between A and C and between B and C.
			- This gives us ^^nine possibilities.^^
			- Then we may join A and B against C; A and C against B; B and C against A.
			- Or put them all in love or all in hate or all indifferent.
			- By adding a third corner, the triangle breeds over twenty variations, more than enough material to progress without repetition.
			- A fourth element would produce compound interlocking triangles, a virtual infinitude of changing relationships.
			- What's more, triangular design brings closure.
			- If a telling is two-sided so that A vacillates between B and no-B, the ending is open. .
			- But if choice is three-sided so that A is caught between B and C, A's choice of one or the other closes the ending with satisfaction.
			- Wheter B and C represent the lesser of two evils or irreconcilable goods, the protagonist can't have both.
			- A price must be paid.
			- One must be risked or lost to gain the other.
			- If, for example, A relinquishes C to have B, the audience feels a true choice has been taken.
			- C has been sacrificed, and this irreversible change ends the story.
			- The most compelling dilemmas often combine the choice of irreconcilable goods with the lesser of two evils.
			- An original work poses choices between unique but irreconcilable desires: It may be between two persons, a person and a lifestyle, two lifestyles, two ideals, two aspects of the innermost self--between any conflicting desires at any level of conflict, real or imagined, the writer may devise.
			- But the principal is universal: Choice must not be doubt but dilemma, not between right/wrong or good/evil, but between either positive desires or negative desires of equal weight and value.

	- ## 11 SCENE ANALYSIS
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### TEXT AND SUBTEXT
			- Just as a personality structure can be disclosed through psychoanalysis, the shape of a scene's inner life can be uncovered through a similar inquiry.
			- If we ask the right questions, a scene that speeds past in the reading and hides its flaws breaks into ultra-slow motion, opens up and reveals its secrets.
			- If you feel a scene plays, don't fix what works.
			- But often a first draft falls flat or seems forced.
			- To find out why a scene fails, the whole must be broken into parts.
			- An analysis begins, therefore, by separating the scene's text from its subtext.
			- ^^Text^^ means the sensory surface of a work of art.
			- In ^^film^^ it's the images onscreen and the soundtrack of dialogue, music, and sound effects.
			- What we see.
			- What we hear.
			- What people say.
			- What people do.
			- ^^Subtext^^ is the life under the surface-thoughts and feelings both known and unknown, hidden by behavior.
			- *Nothing is what it seems.*
			- This principle calls for the screen-writer's constant awareness of the duplicity of life, his recognition that everything exists on at least two levels, and that, therefore, he must write a ^^simultaneous duality^^:
			- First, he must create a ^^verbal description^^ of the sensory surface of life, sight and sound, activity and talk.
			- Second, he must create the ^^inner world^^ of conscious and unconscious desire, action and reaction, impulse and id, genetic and experiential imperatives.
			- As in reality, so in fiction: He must veil the truth with a living mask, the actual thoughts and feelings of characters beyond their saying and doing.
			- An old ^^Hollywood expression^^ goes: 'If the scene is about what the scene is about, you're in deep shit.'
			- It means ^^writing 'on the nose,'^^ writing dialogue and activity in which a character's deepest thoughts and feelings are expressed by what the character says and does-writing the subtext directly into the text.
			- Actors are not marionettes to mime gestures and mouth words.
			- They're artist who create with material from the subtext, not the text.
			- An actor brings a character to life from the inside out, from unspoken, even unconscious thoughts and feelings out to a surface of behavior.
			- The actors will say and do whatever the scene requires, but they find their sources for creation in the inner life.
			- The scene above is unactable because it has no inner life, no subtext.
			- It's unactable because there's nothing to act.
			- When we reflect on our filmgoing, we realize we've witnessed the phenomenon of subtext all our lives.
			- We constantly say to ourselves, 'I know what that character's *really* thinking and feeling.
			- I know what's going on inside her better than she does, and I know it better than the guy she's talking to because he's busy with his own agenda.'
			- In life our eyes tend to stop at the surface.
			- In the ritual of story, however, we continuously see through the faces and activities of characters to depths of the unspoken, the unaware.
			- The scene is not about what the scene seems to be about.
			- It's about something else.
			- Given this, the actor will create a multilayered work that allows us to see through the text to the truth that vibrates behind the eyes, voice, and gestures of life.
			- This principle does not mean that people are insincere.
			- It's a commonsense recognition that we all wear a public mask.
			- Lunatics are those poor souls who have lost their inner communication and so they allow themselves to say and do exactly what they are thinking and feeling and that's why they're mad.
			- In truth, it's virtually impossible for anyone, even the insane, to fully express what's going on inside.
			- Nothing is what it seems.
			- No text without a subtext.
			- Nor does this mean that we can't write powerful dialogue in which desperate people try to tell the truth.
			- It simply means that the most passionate moments must conceal an even deeper level.
			- Characters may say and do anything you can imagine.
			- But because it's impossible for any human being to tell or act the complete truth, because at the very least there's always an unconscious dimension, the writer must layer in a subtext.
			- And when the audience sense that subtext, the scene plays.
			- This principle also extends to the first-person novel, theatrical soliloquy, and direct-to-camera or voice-over narration.
			- For if characters talk privately to us, that doesn't mean for a moment that they know the truth or are capable of telling it.
			- Subtext is present even when a character is alone.
			- For if no one else is watching us, we are.
			- We wear masks to hide our true selves form ourselves.
		- ### THE TECHNIQUE OF SCENE ANALYSIS
			- To ^^analyze a scene^^ you must slice into its pattern of behaviors at the levels of both text and subtext.
			- Once properly examined, its flaws become vividly clear.
			- Below is a ^^five-step process^^ designed to make a scene give up its secrets.
			- ### Step One: Define Conflict
				- First ask, who drives the scene, motivates it, and makes it happen?
				- Any character or force might drive a scene, even an inanimate object or act of nature.
				- Then look into both the text and subtext of this character or force, and ask: What does he (or it) want?
				- ^^Desire^^ is always the key.
				- Phrase this desire (or in the actor's idiom: scene objective) as an infinitive: such as, 'to do this' or 'to get that'
				- Next, look across the scene and ask: What ^^forces of antagonism^^ block this desire?
				- Again, these forces may come from any level or combination.
				- After identifying the source of antagonism, ask: What do the forces of antagonism ^^want^^?
				- This too is best expressed as an infinitive: 'Not to do that...' or 'To get this instead...'
				- If the scene is well written, when you compare the set of phrases expressing the desires from each side, you'll se that they're in direct conflict-not tangential.
			- ### Step Two: Note Opening Value
				- Identify the ^^value at stake^^ in the scene and not its charge, positive or negative, at the opening of the scene.
				- Such as: 'Freedom. The protagonist is at the negative, a prisoner of his own obsessive ambition.'
			- ### Step Three: Break the Scene into Beats
				- A beat is an exchange of action/reaction in character behavior.
				- Look carefully at the scene's first action on two levels:
					- outwardly, in terms of what the character seems to be doing, and more important, look beneath the surface to what he is actually doing.
				- Name this ^^*subtextural action*^^ with an active gerund phase, such as 'Begging.'
				- Try to find phrases that not only indicate action but touch the feelings of the character.
				- 'Pleading' for example, suggests a character acting with a sense of formality, whereas 'Groveling at her feet' conveys a desperate servility.
				- The phrases that express action in the subtext do not describe character activity in literal terms; they go deeper to name the character's essential action with emotive connotations.
				- Now look across the scene to see what reaction that action brought, and describe that reaction with an active gerund phrase.
				- For example, 'Ignoring the plea.'
				  This exchange of action and reaction is a beat.  
				- As long as it continues, Character A is 'Groveling at her feet' but Character B is 'Ignoring the plea,' it's one beat.
				- Even if their exchange repeats a number of times, it's still one and the same beat.
				- A new beat doesn't occur until behavior clearly changes.
				- The analysis then continues through the scene, parsing it into beats.
			- ### Step Four: Note Closing Value and Compare with Opening Value
				- At the end of the scene, examine the ^^value-charged condition^^ of the character's situation and describe it in positive/negative terms.
				- Compare this note to the one made in Step Two.
				- If the two notations are the same, the activity between them is a nonevent.
				- Nothing has changed, therefore nothing has happened.
				- Exposition may have been passed to the audience, but the scene is flat.
				- If, on the other hand, the value has undergone change, then the scene has turned.
			- ### Step Five: Survey Beats and Locate Turning Point
				- Start from the opening beat and review the ^^gerund phrases^^ describing the actions of the characters.
				- As you trace action/reaction to the end of the scene, a shape or pattern should emerge.
				- In a ^^well-designed scene^^, even behaviors that seem helter-skelter will have an arc and a purpose.
				- in fact, in such scenes, it's their careful design that makes the beats feel random.
				- Within the arc locate the moment when the major gap opens between expectation and result, turning the scene to its charged end values.
				- This precise moment is the Turning Point.
		- ^^Ill-written scenes^^ may lack conflict because desires are not opposed, may be antiprogressive because they're repetitious or circular, lopsided because their Turning Points come too early or too late, or lacking credibility because dialogue and action are 'on the nose.'
		- But an analysis of a problematic scene that tests beats against scene objectives, altering behavior to fit desire or desire to fit behavior, will lead to a rewrite that brings the scene to life.
	- ## 12 COMPOSITION
	  collapsed:: true
		- *^^Composition^^* means the ordering and linking of scenes.
		- To guide our efforts the art has evolved canons of composition: *Unity and Variety, Pacing, Rhythm and Tempo, Social and Personal Progression, Symbolic and Ironic Ascension,* and the *Principle of Transition.*
		- ### UNITY AND VARIETY
			- A story, even when expressing chaos, must be unified.
			- This sentence, drawn from any plot, should be logical: '^^Because of the Inciting Incident, the Climax *had to happen.*'^^
			- We should sense a ^^causal lock between Inciting Incident and Story Climax.^^
			- The Inciting Incident is the story's most profound cause, and, therefore, the final effect, the Story Climax, should seem inevitable.
			- The cement that binds them is the Spine, the protagonist's deep desire to restore the balance of life.
			- ^^Unity^^ is critical, but not sufficient.
			- Within this unity, we must induce as much ^^variety^^ as possible.
			- The key to varying a repetitious cadence is research.
			- Superficial knowledge leads to a bland, monotonous telling.
			- With ^^authorial knowledge^^ we can prepare a feast of pleasures.
			- Or at the very least, add humor.
		- ### PACING
			- If we slowly turn the screw, increasing tension a little more, a little more, a little more, scene by scene by scene, we wear the audience out long before the ending.
			- It goes limp and has no energy to invest in the Story Climax.
			- Because a story is a metaphor for life, we expect it to feel like life, to have the ^^rhythm of life^^.
			- This ^^rhythm^^ beats between ^^two contradictory desires:^^ On one hand, ^^we desire serenity,^^ harmony, peace, and relaxation, but too much of this day after day and we become bored to the point of ennui and need therapy.
			- As a result, ^^we also desire challenge^^, tension, danger, even fear.
			- But too much of this day after day and again we end up in the rubber room.
			- So the rhythm of life swings between these poles.
			- This alternation between tension and relaxation is the pulse of living, the rhythm of days, even years.
			- Whether Archplot, Miniplot, or Antiplot, all fine stories flux with the rhythm of life.
			- We use our act structure to start at a base of tension, then rise scene by scene to the Climax of Act One.
			- As we enter ^^Act Two^^, we compose scenes that reduce this tension, switching to comedy, romance, a ^^counterpointing^^ ^^mood^^ that lowers the Act One intensity so that the audience can catch its breath and reach for more energy.
			- We coach the audience to move like a long-distance runner who, rather than loping at a constant pace, speeds, slows, then speeds again, ^^creating cycles^^ that allow him to reach the limit of his reserves.
			- After retarding pace, we build the progressions of the following act until we top the previous Climax in intensity and meaning.
			- Act by act, we tighten and release tension until the final Climax empties out the audience, leaving it emotionally exhausted but fulfilled.
			- Then a brief Resolution scene to recuperate before going home.
			- The gracious storyteller makes love to us.
			- He knows we're capable of a tremendous release...if he paces us to it.
		- ### RHYTHM AND TEMPO
			- *^^Rhythm^^* is set by the length of scenes.
			- How long are we in the same time and place?
			- A typical two-hour feature plays forty to sixty scenes.
			- This means, on average, a scene lasts two and a half minutes.
			- But not every scene.
			- Rather, ^^for every one-minute scene there's a four-minute scene.^^
			- For every ^^thirty-second scene, a six-minute scene.^^
			- In a properly formatted screenplay a page equals a minute of screentime.
			- In other words, if the average length of scene in your script is five pages, your story will have the pace of a postal working on Valium.
			- The average scene length of two to three minutes is a reaction to the nature of cinema and the audience's hunger for a stream of expressive moments.
			- When we study the many exceptions to this principle, they only prove the point.
			- In the Neoclassical period (1750-1850) the French theatre strictly obeyed the *Unities:* A set of conventions that restricted a play's performance to one basic action or plot, taking place in one location within the time it takes to perform.
			- But the French realized that within this unity of time and space the entrance or exit of principal characters radically changes the dynamics of relationships and in effect creates a new scene.
			- Understanding the principle of *French scenes,* Lumet broke the jury room into sets within the set-the drinking fountain, cloakroom, window, one end of the table versus the other.
			- Within these sublocations, he staged *French Scenes.*
			- The over eighty *French Scenes*in TWELVE ANGRY MEN build an exciting *rhythm.*
			- *Tempo* is the level of activity within a scene via dialogue, action, or a combination.
			- For example, lovers talking quietly from pillow to pillow may have low tempo; an argument in a courtroom, high tempo.
			- A character staring out a window coming to a vital life decision may have ^^low tempo^^; a riot,  ^^high tempo^^.
			- In a well-told story, the progression of scenes and sequences accelerates pace.
			- As we head toward act climaxes, we take advantage of *^^rhythm^^* and *^^tempo^^* to progressively shorten scenes while the activity in them becomes more and more brisk.
			- Like music and dance, story is kinetic.
			- We want to use cinema's sensory power to hurl the audience toward act climaxes because scenes of major reversal are, in fact, generally long, slow, and tense.
			- 'Climactic' doesn't mean short and explosive; it means *^^profound change.^^*
			- Such scenes are not to be skimmed over.
			- So we open them and let them breathe; we retard pace while the audience holds its breath, wondering what's going to happen next.
			- Again, the Law of Diminishing Returns applies: ^^The more often we pause, the less effective a pause is.^^
			- If scenes before a major Climax are long and slow, the big scene in which we want the tension to hold falls flat.
			- Because we've dragged the energies of the audience through the sluggish scenes of minor importance, events of great moment are greeted with a shrug.
			- Instead, we must 'earn the pause' by telescoping *rhythm* while spiraling *tempo,* so that when the Climax arrives, we can put the brakes on, stretch the playing time, and the tension holds.
			- The problem with this design, of course, is that it's a cliché.
			- If we lengthen and slow scenes prior to a major reversal, we cripple our Climax.
			- Pace begins in the screenplay.
			- Cliché or not, we must control *rhythm* and *tempo.*
		- ### EXPRESSING PROGRESSION
			- When a story genuinely progresses it calls upon greater and greater human capacity, demanding greater and greater willpower, generates greater and greater change in characters' lives, and places them at greater and greater jeopardy.
			- How are we to express this?
			- There are four primary techniques.
		- ### SOCIAL PROGRESSION
			-
			  > **Widen the impact of character actions into society.**  
			- ^^Let your story begin intimately, involving only a few principal characters.^^
			- But as the telling moves forward, allow their actions to ramify outward into the world around them, touching and changing the lives of more and more people.
			- Not all at once.
			- Rather, spread the effect gradually through the progressions.
		- ### PERSONAL PROGRESSION
			-
			  > **Drive actions deeply into the intimate relationships and inner lives of the characters.**  
			- If the logic of your setting doesn't allow you to go wide, then you must go deep.
			- ^^Start with a personal or inner conflict that demands balancing, yet seems relatively solvable.^^
		- ### SYMBOLIC ASCENTION
			-
			  > **Build the symbolic charge of the story's imagery from the particular to the universal, the specific to the archetypal.**  
			- A good story well told with the added power of subliminal symbolism lifts the telling to the next level of expressivity, and the payoff may be a *great* film.
			- Symbolism is very compelling.
			- ^^Symbolic progression^^ works in this way: start with actions, locations, and roles that represent only themselves.
			- But as the story progresses, choose images that gather greater and greater meaning, until by the end of the telling characters, settings, and events stand for universal ideas.
			-
		- ### IRONIC ASCENTION
			-
			  > **Turn progression on irony.**  
			- ^^Irony^^ is the subtlest manifestation of story pleasure, that delicious sense of 'Ah, life is just like that.'
			- It sees^^life in duality;^^  it plays with our paradoxical existence, aware of the bottomless chasm between what seems and what is.
			- Verbal irony is found in the discrepancy between words and their meanings-a primary source of jokes.
			- But in story, irony plays between actions and results-the primary source of story energy, between appearance and reality-the primary source of truth and emotion.
			- Below are six ironic story patters with an example for each.
				- **1. He gets at last what he's always wanted...but too late to have it.**
				- **2. He's pushed further and further from his goal...only to discover that in fact he's been led right to it.**
				- **3. He throws away what he later finds is indispensable to his happiness.**
				- **4. To reach a goal he unwittingly takes the precise steps necessary to lead him away.**
				- **5. The action he takes to destroy something becomes exactly what are needed to be destroyed by it.**
				- **6. He comes into possession of something he's certain will make him miserable, does everything possible to get rid of it...only to discover it's the gift of happiness.**
			- The ^^key to ironic^^ progression is certainty and precision.
			-
		- ### PRINCIPLE OF TRANSITION
			- A story without a sense of progression tends to stumble form one scene into the next.
			- It has little continuity because nothing links its events.
			- As we design ^^cycles of rising action^^, we must at the same time transition the audience smoothly through them.
			- Between two scenes, therefore, we need a third element, the link that joins the tail of Scene A with the head of Scene B.
			- Generally, we find this ^^third element in one of two places^^: ^^what the scenes have in common^^ or ^^what they have in opposition^^.
			-
			  > **The ^^third element^^ is the hinge for a transition; something held in common by two scenes or counterpointed between them.**  
			- Examples:
				- ^^1 - *A characterization trait.*^^
					- In common: cut from a bratty child to a childish adult.
					- In opposition: cut from awkward protagonist to elegant antagonist.
				- ^^2 - *An action.*^^
					- In common: From the foreplay of lovemaking to savoring the afterglow.
					- In opposition: From chatter to cold silence.
				- ^^3 - *An object.*^^
					- In common: From greenhouse interior to woodland exterior.
					- In opposition: From the Congo to Antartica.
				- ^^4 - *A word.*^^
					- In common: A phrase repeated from scene to scene.
					- In opposition: From compliment to curse.
				- ^^5 - *A quality of light.*^^
					- In common: From shadows at dawn to shade at sunset.
					- In opposition: From blue to red.
				- ^^6 - *A sound.*^^
					- In common: From waves lapping a shore to the rise and fall of a sleeper's breath.
					- In opposition: From silk caressing skin to the grinding of gears.
				- ^^7 - *An idea.*^^
					- In common: From a child's birth to an overture.
					- In opposition: From a painter's empty canvas to an old man dying.
			- After a century of filmmaking, transition clichés abound.
			- Yet we can't put down the task.
			- An imaginative study of almost any two scenes will find a link.
	- ## 13 CRISIS, CLIMAX, RESOLUTION
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### CRISIS
		  collapsed:: true
			- ^^Crisis^^ is the third of the five-part form.
			- It means decision.
			- Characters make spontaneous decisions each time they open their mouths to say 'this' not 'that.'
			- In each scene they make a decision to take on action rather than another.
			- But Crisis with a capital C is the ultimate decision.
			- The ^^Chinese ideogram for Crisis^^ is two terms: Danger/Opportunity - 'danger' in that the wrong decision at this moment will lose forever what we want; 'opportunity' in that the right choice will achieve our desire.
			- The protagonist's quest has carried him through the Progressive Complications until he's exhausted all actions to achieve his desire, save one.
			- He now finds himself at the end of the line.
			- His next action is his last.
			- No tomorrow.
			- No second chance.
			- This moment of dangerous opportunity is the point of greatest tension in the story as both protagonist and audience sense that the question 'How will this turn out?' will be answered out of the next action.
			- ^^The Crisis^^ is the story's ^^Obligatory Scene.^^
			- From the Inciting Incident on, the audience has been anticipating with growing vividness the scene in which the protagonist will be face to face with the most focused, powerful forces of antagonism in his existence.
			- This is the dragon, so to speak, that guards the Object of Desire.
			- The audience leans into the Crisis filled with expectation mingled with uncertainty.
			- The Crisis must be ^^true dilemma-^^ a choice between irreconcilable goods, the lesser of two evils, or the two at once that places the protagonist under the maximum pressure of his life.
			-
			  > **^^This dilemma^^ confronts the protagonist who, when face-to-face with the most powerful and focused forces of antagonism in his life, must make a decision to take one action or another in a last effort to achieve his Object of Desire.**  
			- How the protagonist chooses here gives us the most penetrating view of his deep character, the ultimate expression of his humanity.
			- This scene reveals the story's most important value..
			- If there's been any doubt about which value is central, as the protagonist makes the Crisis Decision, the primary value comes to the fore.
			- At Crisis the ^^protagonist's willpower^^ is most severely tested.
			- As we know from life, decisions are far more difficult to make than actions are to take.
			- We're left to wonder why we dreaded doing it until we realize that most of life's actions are within our reach, but decisions take willpower.
		- ### CRISIS WITHIN THE CLIMAX
		  collapsed:: true
			- The action the protagonist chooses to take becomes the story's consummate event, causing a positive, negative, or ironically positive/negative Story Climax.
			- If, however, as the protagonist takes the climactic action, we once more pry apart the gap between expectation and result, if we can split probability from necessity just one more time, we may create a majestic ending the audience will treasure for a lifetime.
			- For a Climax built around a Turning Point is the most satisfying of all.
			- We've taken the protagonist through progressions that exhaust one action after another until he reaches the limit and thinks he finally understands his world and knows what he must do in a last effort.
			- The protagonist may or may not get what he wants, but it ^^won't be the way he expects.^^
			- ### Placement of the Crisis
				-
				  > **^^The location of the Crisis^^ is determined by the length of the climactic action.**  
			- Generally, Crisis and Climax happen in the last minutes and in the same scene.
			- However, in other stories the Climax becomes an expansive action with its own progressions.
			- As a result, it's possible to use the ^^Crisis Decision^^ to turn the ^^Penultimate Act Climax^^, filling all of the final act with climactic action.
			- In rarer examples the Crisis Decision immediately follows the Inciting Incident and the entire film becomes climactic action.
			- The great risk of placing the Crisis on the heels of the Inciting Incident is repetitiousness.
			- Whether it's high-budget action repeating patterns of chase/fight, chase/fight, or low-budget repetitions of drinking/drinking/drinking, etc. the problems of variety and progression are staggering.
			- Yet mastery of this task may produce brilliance, as it did in the example above.
			- ### Design of the Crisis
				- Although the Crisis Decision and climactic action usually take place in continuous time within the same location at the very end of the telling, it's not uncommon for the Crisis decision to occur in one location, the Story Climax later in another setting.
				- If the Crisis takes place in one location and the Climax later in another, we must splice them together on a cut, fusing them in filmic time and space.
				- If we do not, if we cut from the Crisis to other material-a subplot, for example-we drain the pent-up energy of the audience into an  anticlimax.
				-
				  > **The^^Crisis Decision^^  must be a deliberately static moment.**  
				- This is the Obligatory Scene.
				- *Do not put it offscreen, or skim over it.*
				- The audience wants to suffer with the protagonist through the pain of this dilemma.
				- We freeze this moment because the rhythm of the last movement depends on it.
				- An emotional momentum has built to this point, but the Crisis dams its flow.
				- Tension builds and builds, then as the protagonist makes a choice of action, that compressed energy explodes into the Climax.
				-
		- ### CLIMAX
			- ^^Story Climax^^ is the fourth of the five-part structure.
			- This crowning Major Reversal is not necessarily full of noise and violence.
			- Rather it must be ^^full of meaning.^^
			- If I could send a telegram to the film producers of the world, it would be these three worlds: 'Meaning Produces Emotion.'
			-
			  > **^^MEANING^^: A revolution in values from positive to negative or negative to positive with or without irony-a value swing at the maximum charge that's absolute and irreversible. The meaning of that change moves the heart of the audience.**  
			- The action that creates this change must be 'pure,' clear, and self-evident, requiring no explanation.
			- Dialogue or narration to spell it out is boring and redundant.
			- This action must be appropriate to the needs of the story.
			- It may be catastrophic or outwardly trivial.
			- The Climax of the last act is your great imaginative leap.
			- Without it, you have no story.
			- Once the Climax is in hand, stories are in a significant way rewritten backward, not forward.
			- The flow of life moves from cause to effect, but the flow of creativity often flows from effect to cause.
			- All scenes must be thematically or structurally justified in the light of the Climax.
			- If logic allows, climax subplots within the Central Plot's Climax.
			- If this multiplying effect is impossible, the least important subplots are best climaxed earliest, followed by the next most important, building overall to Climax of the Central Plot.
			- ^^William Goldman^^ argues that *the key to all story endings is to give the audience what it wants, but not the way it expects.*
			- They go because such stories resonate with their past and are deeply cathartic.
			- So we give the audience the experience we've promised, but not in the way it expects.
			- This is what separates artist from amateur.
			- In ^^Aristotle's words^^, an ending must be both 'inevitable and unexpected.'
			- ^^Inevitable^^ in the sense that as the Inciting Incident occurs, everything and anything seems possible, but at Climax, as the audience looks back through the telling, it should seem that the path the telling took was the *only* path.
			- Given the characters and their world as we've come to understand it, the Climax was inevitable and satisfying.
			- But at the same time it must be unexpected, happening *in a way* the audience could not have anticipated.
			- The key to a great film ending, as ^^Francois Truffaut^^ put it, is to create a combination of 'Spectacle and Truth.'
			- When Truffaut says, '^^Spectacle^^,' he means a Climax written, not for the ear, but the eye.
			- By '^^Truth^^' he means Controlling Idea.
			- In other words, Truffaut is asking us to create the *^^Key Image^^* of the film- a single image that sums up and concentrates all meaning and emotion.
			- The Key Image within the climactic action echoes and resonates all that has gone before.
			- It is an image that is so tuned to the telling that when it's remembered the whole film comes back with a jolt.
			-
		- ### RESOLUTION
			- The *^^Resolution^^,* the fifth of the five-part structure, is any material  left after Climax and has three possible uses.
			- First, the logic of the telling may not provide an opportunity to climax a subplot before or during the Climax of the Central Plot, so it'll need a scene of its own at the very end.
			- The story's emotional heart is in the main plot.
			- A second use of Resolution is to show the spread of climactic effects.
			- If a film expresses progressions by widening into society, its Climax may be restricted to the principal of characters.
			- The audience, however, has come to know many supporting roles whose lives will be changed by the climactic action.
			- This motivates a social event that satisfies our curiosity by bringing the entire caste to one location where the camera can track around to show us how these lives have been changed.
			- Even if the first two uses don't apply, all films need a Resolution as a courtesy to the audience.
			- A film needs what the theatre calls a '^^slow curtain^^.'
			- A line of description at the bottom of the last page that sends the camera slowly back or tracking along images for a few seconds, ^^so the audience can catch its breath, gather its thoughts, and leave the cinema with dignity.^^

- # PART 4 - THE WRITER AT WORK
	-
	  > *The first draft of anything is shit. - Ernest Hemmingway*  
	- ## 14 THE PRINCIPLE OF ANTAGONISM
	  collapsed:: true
		- In my experience, the principle of antagonism is the most important and least understood precept in story design.
		- Neglect of this fundamental concept is the primary reason screenplays and the films made from them fail.
		-
		  > **THE ^^PRINCIPAL OF ANTAGONISM^^: A protagonist and his story can only be as intellectually fascinating and emotionally compelling as the forces of antagonism make them.**  
		- ^^Human nature^^ is fundamentally conservative.
		- We never do more than what we have to, expend energy we don't have to, take any risks we don't have to, change *if we don't have to.*
		- Therefore, what will cause a protagonist to become a fully realized, multidimensional, and deeply empathetic character?
		- What will bring a dead screenplay to life?
		- The answer to both questions lies on the negative side of the story.
		- The more powerful and complex the forces of antagonism opposing the character, the more completely realized character and story *must* become.
		- 'Forces of antagonism' doesn't necessarily refer to a specific antagonist or villain.
		- In appropriate genres arch-villains, like the Terminator, are a delight, but by 'forces of antagonism' we mean the sum total of all forces that oppose the character's will and desire.
		- If we study a protagonist at the moment of the Inciting Incident and weigh the sum of his willpower along with his intellectual, emotional, social, and physical capacities against the total forces of antagonism from within his humanity, plus his personal conflicts, antagonistic institutions, and environment, we should see clearly that he's an underdog.
		- He has a chance to achieve what he wants--but only a chance.
		- Although conflict from one aspect of his life may seem solvable, the totality of all levels should seem overwhelming as he begins his quest.
		- We pour energy into the negative side of a story not only to bring the protagonist and other characters to full realization--roles to challenge and attract the world's finest actors--but to take the story itself to the end of the line, to a brilliant and satisfying climax.
		- ### TAKING STORY AND CHARACTER TO THE END OF THE LINE
			- ^^Does your story contain negative forces of such power that the positive side *must* gain surpassing quality?^^
			- Below is a ^^technique to guide your self-critique and answer that critical question.^^
			- Begin by identifying the primary value at stake in your story.
			- For example, Justice.
			- Generally, the protagonist will represent the positive change of this value; the forces of antagonism, the negative.
			- Life, however, is subtle and complex, rarely a case of yes/no, good/evil, right/wrong.
			- There are degrees of negativity.
			- First the ^^*Contradictory*^^value, the direct opposite of the positive.
			- In this case, Injustice.
			- Laws have to be broken.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887134609_0.png)
			- Between the Positive value and its Contradictory, however, is the ^^*Contrary:*^^ a situation that's somewhat negative but not fully the opposite.
			- The Contrary of justice is unfairness, a situation that's negative but not necessarily illegal: nepotism, racism, bureaucratic delay, bias, inequities of all kinds.
			- Perpetrators of unfairness may not break the law, but they're neither just nor fair.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887203640_0.png)
			- The Contradictory, however, is not the limit of human experience.
			- At the end of the line waits the ^^*Negation of the Negation,*^^ a force of antagonism that's doubly negative.
			- One subject is life, not arithmetic.
			- In life two negatives don't make a positive.
			- In English double negatives are ungrammatical, but Italian uses double and even triple negatives so that a statement *feels* like its meaning.
			- Double negatives turn positive only in math and formal logic.
			- In life things just get worse and worse and worse.
			-
			  > **A story that progresses to the limit of human experience in depth and breadth of conflict must move through a pattern that includes the Contrary, the Contradictory, and the Negation of the Negation.**  
			- (The positive mirror image of this negative declension runs from *Good* to *Better* to *Best* to *Perfect.* But for mysterious reasons, working with this progression is of no help to the storyteller.)
			- ^^Negation of the Negation^^ means a compound negative in which a life situation turns not just quantitatively but *qualitatively* worse.
			- The Negation of the Negation is at the limit of the dark powers of human nature.
			- In terms of justice, this state is *^^tyranny^^.*
			- Or, in a phrase that applies to personal as well as social politics: 'Might Makes Right.'
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887422873_0.png)
			- The difference between the Contradictory and the Negation of the Negation of justice is the difference between the relatively limited and temporary power of those who break the law versus the unlimited and enduring power of those who make the law.
			- It's the difference between a world where law exists and a world where might makes right.
			- The absolute depth of injustice is not criminality, but 'legal' crimes committed by governments against their own citizens.
			- Below are more examples to demonstrate how this declension works in other stories and genres.
			- First, love:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887536408_0.png)
			- To hate other people is bad enough, but even a misanthrope loves one person.
			- When self-love vanishes and a character loathes his own being, he reaches the Negation of the Negation and existence becomes a living hell: Raskolnikov in CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.
			- A second variation:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887606866_0.png)
			- With whom would you rather have a relationship?
			- With someone who hates you and honestly admits it, or with someone you know hates you but pretends to love you?
			- Many parents hate their children, many children hate their parents, and they fight and scream and say it.
			- In these fin films, although a parent bitterly resents and secretly hates his or her child, they pretend to love him.
			- When the antagonist adds that lie, the story moves to the Negation of the Negation.
			- How can a child defend himself against that?
			- When the primary value is truth:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887653081_0.png)
			- White lies are the ^^Contrary^^ because they're often told to do good: lovers waking up with the pillow creases branded across their faces, telling each other how beautiful they look.
			- The blatant liar knows the truth, then buries it to gain advantage.
			- But when we lie to ourselves and believe it, truth vanishes and we're at the Negation of the Negation.
			- If the positive were Consciousness, being fully alive and aware:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887678071_0.png)
			- This is the declension of *Horror* films in which the antagonist is supernatural.
			- But we don't have to be religious to grasp the meaning of *damnation.*
			- Whether or not hell exists, this world provides its own Infernos, plights in which death would be a mercy and we'd beg for it.
			- If the positive were wealth:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887717032_0.png)
			- A billionaire feels impoverished because no amount of money is enough.
			- A billionaire, he acts as if he were a starving thief, grasping for money at any illegal opportunity.
			- If the positive were open communication between people:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887736871_0.png)
			- The Contrary has many varieties-silence, misunderstanding, emotional blocks.
			- The all-inclusive term 'alienation' means a situation of being with people, but feeling cut off and unable to fully communicate.
			- In isolation, however, there is no one to talk to except yourself.
			- When you lose this and suffer a loss of communication within your mind, you're at the Negation of the Negation and insane.
			- Full achievement of ideals or goals:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887833873_0.png)
			- Compromise means 'settling for less,' the willingness to fall short of your ideal but not surrender it completely.
			- Negation, however, is something people in show business have to guard against.
			- Intelligence:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669887892792_0.png)
			- Ignorance is temporary stupidity due to lack of information, but stupidity is resolute, no matter how much information is given.
			- The Negation of the Negation cuts both ways: inwardly, when a stupid person believes he's intelligent, a conceit of numerous comic characters, or outwardly, when society thinks a stupid person is intelligent.
			- Liberty:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669888045915_0.png)
			- Restraint has many shades.
			- Laws bind us but make civilization possible, while imprisonment is fully negative, although society finds it useful.
			- The Negation of the Negation works two ways.
			- Inwardly: *Self-enslavement*is qualitatively worse than slavery.
			- A slave has his free will and would do all he could to escape.
			- But to corrode your willpower with drugs or alcohol and turn yourself into a slave is far worse.
			- Outwardly: *Slavery is perceived as freedom.*
			- Courage:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669888168697_0.png)
			- A courageous person can be temporarily stifled when fear strikes, but eventually he acts.
			- The coward does not.
			- *The end of the line* is reached, however, when a coward takes an action that outwardly appears courageous:
			- A battle rages around a foxhole.
			- In it a wounded officer turns to a coward and says: 'Jack, your buddies are running out of ammo. Take these boxes of shells through the minefield or they'll be overrun.'
			- So the coward takes out his gun...and shoots the officer.
			- At first glance we might think it would take courage to shoot an officer, but we'd soon realize that this was an act at their sheer limit of cowardice.
			- Loyalty:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669888605795_0.png)
			- Contrary: A married woman falls in love with another man, but doesn't act on it.
			- Secretly, she feels loyal to both men, but when her husband learns of it, he sees her split allegiance as a betrayal.
			- She defends herself, arguing that she didn't sleep with the other man, so she was never disloyal.
			- The difference between feeling and action is often subjective.
			- Maturity:
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669888678124_0.png)
			-
			- Lastly, consider a story in which the positive value is sanctioned natural sex.
			- *Sanctioned* meaning condoned by society;
			- *natural* meaning sex for procreation, attendant pleasure, and an expression of love.
			- Under the Contrary falls acts of extramarital and premarital sex that, although natural, are frowned upon.
			- Society often does more than frown on prostitution, but it's arguably natural.
			- Bigamy, polygamy, polyandry, and interracial and common-law marriage are condoned in some societies, unsanctioned in others.
			- Chastity is arguably unnatural, but no one's going to stop you from being celibate, while sex with someone who has taken a vow of celibacy, such as a priest or nun, is frowned on by the Curch.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669888829777_0.png)
			- Under the Contradictory, humanity seems to know no limit of invention: voyeurism …etc.
			- Many of these designations may seem arbitrary, for sex is relative to social and personal perception.
			- But common perversions are not the end of the line.
			- They're singular and committed, even with violence, with another human being.
			- When, however, the sexual object is from another species-bestiality-or dead-necrophilia-or when compounds of perversities pile up, the mind revolts.
			- The principle of the Negation of the Negation not only applies to the tragic but to the comic.
			- The comic world is chaotic, wild place where actions must go to the limit.
			- If not, the laugh falls flat.
			- Fine writers have always understood that opposite values are not the limit of human experience.
			- If a story stops at the Contradictory value, or worse, the Contrary, it echoes the hundreds of mediocrities we suffer every year.
			- If a story does not reach the Negation of the Negation, it may strike the audience as satisfying-but never brilliant, never sublime.
			- *All other factors of talent, craft, and knowledge being equal, greatness is found in the writer's treatment of the negative side.*
			- If your story seems unsatisfying and lacking in some way, tools are needed to penetrate its confusions and perceive its flaws.
			- When a story is weak, the inevitable cause is that forces of antagonism are weak.
			- Rather than spending your creativity trying to invent likable, attractive aspects of protagonist and world, build the negative side to create a chain reaction that pays off naturally and honestly on the positive dimensions.
			- The first step is to question the values at stake and their progression.
			- What are the positive values?
			- Which is preeminent and turns the Story Climax?
			- Do the forces of antagonism explore all shades of negativity?
			- Do they reach the power of the Negation of Negation at some point?
			- Generally, progressions run from the Positive to the Contrary in Act One, to the Contradictory in later acts, and finally to the Negation of the Negation in the last act, either ending tragically or going back to the Positive with a profound difference.
			- Anything is possible, but the *end of the line* must be reached.

	- ## 15 EXPOSITION
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### SHOW DON'T TELL
			- ^^*Exposition*^^ means facts--the information about setting, biography, and characterization that the audience needs to know to follow and comprehend the events of the story
			- Within the first pages of a screenplay a reader can judge the relative skill of the writer simply by noting how he handles exposition.
			- Well-done exposition doesn't guarantee a superb story, but it does tell us that the writer knows the craft.
			- ^^Skill in exposition^^ means making it *invisible*.
			- As the story progresses, the audience absorbs all it needs to know effortlessly, even unconsciously.
			- The famous axiom 'Show, don't tell' is the key.
			- Never force words into a character's mouth to *tell* the audience about world, history, or person.
			- Rather, *^^show^^* us honest, natural ways...yet at the same time indirectly pass along the necessary facts.
			- In other words, ^^*dramatize exposition.*^^
			- Dramatized exposition serves two ends: Its primary purpose is to further the immediate conflict.
			- Its secondary purpose is to convey information.
			- The anxious novice reverses that order, putting expositional duty ahead of dramatic necessity.
			- No one ever tells someone something they both already know unless saying the obvious fills another and compelling need.
			- Therefore, if this information is needed, the writer must create a motivation for the dialogue that's greater than the facts.
			- To ^^dramatize exposition^^ apply this mnemonic principle: ^^*Covert exposition to ammunition.*^^
			- Your characters know their world, their history, each other, and themselves.
			- Let them use what they know as ammunition in their struggle to get what they want.
			- 'Show, don't tell' means that characters *and camera* behave truthfully.
			- Dealing with the knotty problems of exposition so intimidates some writers that they try to get it all out of the way as soon as possible, so the studio script analysis can concentrate on their stories.
			- But when forced to wade through an Act One stuffed with exposition, the reader realizes that this is an amateur who can't handle the basic craft, and skims to the last scenes.
			- Confident writers parse out exposition, bit by bit, through the entire story, often revealing exposition well into the Climax of the last act.
			- They follow these two principles: Never include anything the audience can reasonably and easily assume has happened.
			- Never pass on exposition unless the missing fact would cause confusion.
			- You do not keep the audience's interest by giving it information, but by *withholding* information, except that which is absolutely necessary for comprehension.
			- Pace the exposition.
			- Like all else, exposition must have a progressive pattern: Therefore, the least important facts come in early, the next most important later, the critical facts last.
			- And what are the critical pieces of exposition?
			- Secrets.
			- The painful truth characters do not want known.
			- In other words, don't write 'California scenes.'
			- ^^'California scenes'^^ are scenes in which two characters who hardly know each other sit down over coffee and immediately begin an intimate discussion of deep, dark secrets in their lives.
			- Unguardedly honest and painful confessions between people who have just met are forced and false.
			- When this is pointed out to writers, they will argue that it actually happens, that people share very personal things to strangers.
			- Only in California. Nowhere else in the world.
			- The pressure of life squeezing characters between the lesser of two evils create honest and powerful moments.
			- And where in a well-crafted story is pressure the greatest?
			- *At the end of the line.*
			- The wise writer, therefore, obeys the first principle of temporal art: *Save the best for last.*
			- For if we reveal too much too soon, the audience will see the climaxes coming long before they arrive.
			- *Reveal only that exposition the audience absolutely needs and wants to know and no more.*
			- On the other hand, since the writer controls the telling, he controls the need and desire to know.
			- If at a certain point in the telling, a piece of exposition must be known or the audience wouldn't be able to follow, create the desire to know by arousing curiousity.
			- With a hunger for information, even the most complicated set of dramatized facts will pass smoothly into understanding.
			- One way to cope with biographical exposition is to start the telling in the protagonist's childhood and then work through all the decades of his life.
			- However, as convenient as the design may be in terms of exposition, the vast majority of protagonists cannot be followed from birth to death for this reason: Their story would have no Spine.
			- For most characters, what single, deep desire, aroused out of an Inciting Incident in childhood, would go unquenched for decades?
			- This is why nearly all tellings pursue the protagonist's Spine over months, weeks, even hours.
			- If, however, an elastic, endurable *Spine* can be created, then a story can be told over decades without being episodic.
			- Episodic does not mean 'covering long stretches of time' but rather 'sporadic, irregular intervals.'
			- A story told over twenty-four hours could well be episodic if everything that happens in that day is unconnected to everything else that happens.
			- Because lifelong Spines are rare, we take ^^Aristotle's^^ advice to begin stories *in media res*, 'in the midst of things.'
			- After locating the date of the climactic event of the protagonist's life, we begin as close in time to it as possible.
			- This design compresses the telling's duration, and lengthens the character's biography before the Inciting Incident.
			- For example, if the Climax occurs on the day a character turns thirty-five, instead of starting the film when he's a teenager, we open the film perhaps a month before his birthday.
			- This gives the protagonist thirty-five years of living to build the maximum value into his existence.
			- As a result, when his life goes out of balance, he is now at risk and the story is filled with conflict.
			- Lives with little or no value beyond their existence are pathetic to witness, but with so little at stake, the writer is reduced to painting a static portrait of suffering.
			- Rather, we tell stories about people who have ^^something to lose^^--family, careers, ideals, opportunities, reputations, realistic hopes and dreams.
			- When such lives go out of balance, the characters are placed at jeopardy.
			- They stand to lose what they have in their struggle to achieve a rebalancing of existence.
			- Their battle, risking hard-won values against the forces of antagonism, generates conflict.
			- And when story is thick with conflict, the characters need all the ammunition they can get.
			- As a result, the writer has little trouble dramatizing exposition and facts flow naturally and invisibly into the action.
			- But when stories lack conflict, the writer is forced into 'table dusting.'
			- If you can thoroughly dramatize exposition and make it invisible, if you can control its disclosure, parsing it out only when and if the audience needs and wants to know it, saving the best for last, you're learning your craft.
			- But what's a problem for beginning writers becomes an invaluable asset tot hose who know the craft.
			- Rather than avoiding exposition by giving their characters an anonymous past, they goo out of their way to salt their biographies with significant events.
			- Because what is the challenge that the storyteller faces dozens of times over in the telling?
			- How to turn the scene.
			- How to create Turning Points.
		- ### THE USE OF BACKSTORY
			- *We can turn scenes only one of two ways: an action or on revelation.*
			- *There are no other means.*
			-
			  > **Powerful revelations come from the ^^BACKSTORY^^--previous significant events in the lives of the characters that the writer can reveal at critical moments to create Turning Points.**  
		- ### FLASHBACKS
			- The *^^flashback^^* is simply another form of exposition.
			- Like all else, it's done either well or ill.
			- A flashback can work wonders if we follow the fine principles of conventional exposition.
			-
			  > **First, dramatize flashbacks.**  
			- Rather than flashing back to flat scenes in the past, interpolate a minidrama into the story with its own Inciting Incident, progressions, and Turning Point.
			- Although producers often claim that flashbacks slow a film's pace, and indeed badly done they do, a well-done flashback actually accelerates pace.
			-
			  > **Second, do not bring in a flashback until you have created in the audience the need and desire to know.**  
			- We must realize that a screenplay is not a novel.
			- Novelists can directly invade the thoughts and feelings of characters.
			- We cannot.
			- Novelists, therefore, can indulge the luxury of free association.
			- We cannot.
			- Exposition in prose is relatively easy, but the camera is an X-ray machine for all things false.
			- If we try to force exposition into a film through novel-like free associative editing or semisubliminal flutter cuts that 'glimpse' a character's thoughts, it strikes us as contrived.
		- ### DREAM SEQUENCES
			- The *^^Dream Sequence^^* is exposition in a ball gown.
			- Everything above applies doubly to these usually feeble efforts to disguise information in Freudian clichés.
		- ### MONTAGE
			- In the American use of this term, a ^^montage^^ is a series of rapidly cut images that radically condenses or expands time and often employs optical effects such as wipes, irises, split screens, dissolves, or other multiple images.
			- The high energy of such sequences is used to mask their purpose: the rather mundane task of conveying information.
			- Like the Dream Sequence, the montage is an effort to make undramatized exposition less boring by keeping the audience's eye busy.
			- With few exceptions, montages are a lazy attempt to substitute decorative photography and editing for dramatization and are, therefore, to be avoided.
		- ### VOICE-OVER NARRATION
			- ^^Voice-over narration^^ is another way to divulge exposition.
			- Like the Flashback, it's done well or ill.
			- The test of narration is this: Ask yourself, 'If I were to strip the voice-over out of my screenplay, would the story still be well told?'
			- If the answer is yes...keep it in.
			- Generally, the principle 'Less is more' applies: the more economical the technique the more impact it has.
			- Therefore, anything that can be cut should be cut.
			- If narration can be removed and the story still stands on its feet well told, then you've probably used narration for the only good reason-as counterpoint.
			- Occasionally, brief telling narration, especially at the opening or during transitions between acts is inoffensive, *but the trend toward using telling narration throughout a film threatens the future of our art.*
		- It takes little talent and less effort to fill a soundtrack with explanation.
		- 'Show, don't tell' is a call for artistry and discipline, a warning to us not to give in to laziness but to set *creative limitations* that demand the fullest use of imagination and sweat.
		- Dramatizing every turn into a natural, seamless flow of scenes is hard work, but when we allow ourselves the comfort of 'on the nose' narration we gut our creativity, eliminate the audience's curiosity and destory narrative drive.
		- More importantly, 'Show, don't tell' means respect the intelligence and sensitivity of your audience.
	- ## 16 PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
	  collapsed:: true
		- This chapter examines eight enduring problems, from how to hold interest, to how to adapt from other media, to how to cope with holes in logic.
		- For each problem the craft provides solutions.
		- ### THE PROBLEM OF INTEREST
		  collapsed:: true
			- Marketing may entice an audience into the theatre, but once the ritual begins, it needs compelling reasons to stay involved.
			- A story must capture interest, hold it unswervingly through time, then reward it at Climax.
			- This task is next to impossible unless the design attracts both sides of human nature-intellect and emotion.
			- *^^Curiosity^^* is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns.
			- Story plays to this universal desire by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations.
			- Each Turning Point hooks curiosity.
			- As the protagonist is put at increasingly greater risk, the audience wonders, 'What's going to happen next?' etc.
			- The answer to this will not arrive until the last act Climax, and so the audience, held by curiosity, stays put.
			- We make the audience cry or laugh, but above all, as Charles Reade noted, we make it wait.
			- *^^Concern^^*, on the other hand, is the emotional need for the positive values of life: justice, strength, survival, love, truth, courage.
			- Human nature is instinctively repelled by what it perceives as negative, while drawn powerfully toward positive.
			- As a story opens, the audience, consciously or instinctively, inspects the value-charged landscape of words and characters, trying to separate good from evil, right from wrong, things of value from things of no value.
			- It seeks the *^^Center of Good^^.*
			- Once finding this core, emotions flow to it.
			- The reason we search for the Center of Good is that each of us believes that we are good or right and want to identify with the positive.
			- The worst of people believe themselves good.
			- No matter who's in the audience, each seeks the Center of Good, the positive focus for empathy and emotional interest.
			- At the very least the Center of Good must be located in the protagonist.
			- Others may share it, for we can empathize with any number of characters, but we *must* empathize with the protagonist.
			- 'Good' as defined as much by what it's not as by what it is.
			- From the audience's point of view, 'good is a judgment made in relationship to or against a background of negativity, a universe that's thought or felt to be 'not good.'
			- How far can we take the Center of Good?
			- With what kind of monsters will an audience empathize?
			- ### Mystery, Suspense, and Dramatic Irony
				- *Curiosity* and *Concern* create three possible ways to connect the audience to the story: *^^Mystery^^*, *^^Suspense^^*, and *^^Dramatic Irony^^.*
				- These terms are not mistaken for genres; they name story/audience relationships that vary according to how we hold interest.
				-
				  > **In ^^Mystery^^ the audience knows less than the characters.**  
				- Mystery means gaining interest through curiosity alone.
				- We create but then conceal expositional facts, particularly facts in the Backstory.
				- We arouse the audience's curiosity about these past events, tease it with hints of the truth, then deliberately keep it in the dark by misleading it with 'red herrings,' so that it believes or suspects false facts while we hide the real facts.
				- 'Red herrings' has an amusing etymology: As a peasant poachers of deer and grouse made off with their booty through medieval forests, they would drag a fish, a red herring, across the trail to confuse the lord of manor's bloodhounds.
				- This technique of compelling interest by devising a guessing game of red herrings and suspects, of confusion and curiosity, pleases the audience of one and only one genre, the *Murder Mystery,* which has two subgenres, the *Closed Mystery*and the *Open Mystery.*
				- The *Closed Mystery* is the Agatha Christie form in which a murder is committed unseen in the Backstory.
				- The primary convention of the 'Who done it?' is multiple suspects.
				- The writer must develop at least three possible killers to constantly mislead the audience to suspect the wrong person, the red herring, while withholding the identity of the real killer to Climax.
				- The *Open Mystery* is the *Columbo* form in which the audience sees the murder committed and therefore knows who did it.
				- The story becomes a 'How will he catch him?' as the writer substitutes multiple clues for multiple suspects.
				- The murder must be an elaborate and seemingly perfect crime, a complex scheme involving a number of steps and technical elements.
				- But the audience knows by convention that one of these elements is a fatal flaw of logic.
				- When the detective arrives on the scene he instinctively knows who did it, sifts through the many clues searching for the telltale flaw, discovers it, and confronts the arrogant perfect-crime-committer, who then spontaneously confesses.
				- In the Mystery form the killer and detective know the facts long before CLimax but keep it to themselves.
				- The audience runs from behind trying to figure out what they key characters already know. These two pure designs may be mixed or satirized.
				-
				  > **In ^^Suspense^^ the audience and characters know the same information.**  
				- *Suspense combines both Curiosity and Concern.
				- *Ninety percent of all films, comedy and drama, compel interest in this mode.
				- In Suspense, however, curiosity is not about fact but outcome.
				- The outcome of a *Murder Mystery*is always certain.
				- Although we don't know who or how, the detective will catch the killer and the story will end 'up.'
				- But the Suspense story could end 'up' or 'down' or in irony.
				- Characters and audience move shoulder to shoulder through the telling sharing the same knowledge.
				- As the characters discover expositional fact, the audience discovers it.
				- But what no one knows is 'How will this turn out?'
				- In this relationship we feel empathy and identify with the protagonist, whereas in pure Mystery our involvement is limited to sympathy.
				- Master detectives are charming and likable, but we never identify with them because they're too perfect and never in real jeopardy.
				- *Murder Mysteries* are like board games, cool entertainments for the mind.
				-
				  > **In ^^Dramatic Irony^^ the audience knows more than the characters.**  
				- Dramatic Irony creates interest primarily through concern alone, eliminating curiosity about fact and consequence.
				- Such stories often open with the ending, deliberately giving away the outcome.
				- When the audience is given the godlike superiority of knowing events before they happen, its emotional experience switches.
				- What in Suspense would be anxiety about outcome and fear for the protagonist's well-being, in Dramatic Irony becomes dread of the moment the character discovers what we already know and compassion for someone we see heading for disaster.
				- Placing the audience in the position of Dramatic Irony does not eliminate all curiosity.
				- The result of showing the audience what will happen is to cause them to ask, 'How and why did these characters do what I already know they did?'
				- Dramatic Irony encourages the audience to look more deeply into the motivations and causal forces at work in the character's lives.
				- This is why we often enjoy a fine film more, or at least differently, on second viewing.
				- We not only flex the underused emotions of compassion and dread, but freed from curiosity about facts and outcome, we now concentrate on inner lives, unconscious energies, and the subtle workings of society.
				- However the majority of genres do not lend themselves to either pure Mystery or pure Dramatic Irony.
				- Instead, within the Suspense relationship writers enrich the telling by mixing the other wto.
				- In an overall Suspense design, some sequences may employ Mystery to increase curiosity about certain facts, others may switch to Dramatic Irony to touch the audience's heart.
				- A certain amount of audience curiosity is essential.
				- WIthout it, Narrative Design grinds to a halt.
				- The craft gives you the power to conceal fact or outcome in order to keep the audience looking ahead and asking questions.
				- It gives you the power to mystify the audience, if that's appropriate.
				- But you must not abuse this power.
				- If so, the audience, in frustration, will tune out.
				- Instead, reward the filmgoer for his concentration with honest, insightful answers to his questions.
				- No dirty tricks, no Cheap Surprise, no False Mystery.
				- False Mystery is a counterfeit curiosity caused by the artificial concealment of fact.
				- Exposition that could and should have been given to the audience is withheld in hope of holding interest over long, undramatized passages.
				-
		- ### THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
			- The audience prays for ^^surprise^^, the reversal of expectation.
			- As characters arrive onscreen, the audience surrounds them with expectations, feeling 'this' will happen, 'that' will change...etc.
			- If what the audience expects to happen happens, or worse, if it happens the *way* the audience expects it to happen, this will be a very unhappy audience.
			- We must surprise them.
			- There are two kinds of surprise: cheap and true.
			- True surprise springs from the sudden revelation of the Gap between expectation and result.
			- This surprise is 'true' because it's followed by a rush of insight, the revelation of a truth hidden beneath the surface of the fictional world.
			- Cheap Surprise takes advantage of the audience's vulnerability.
			- As it sits in the dark, the audience places its emotions in the storyteller's hands.
			- We can always shock filmgoers by smash cutting to something it doesn't expect to see or away from something expects to continue.
			- By suddenly and inexplicably breaking the narrative flow we can always jolt people.
			- But as Aristotle complained, 'To be about to act and not to act is the worst. It is shocking without being tragic.'
			- In certain genres--*Horror, Fantasy, Thriller* - cheap surprise is a convention and part of the fun.
			- Outside these genres, however, cheap surprise is a shoddy device.
			-
		- ### THE PROBLEM OF COINCIDENCE
			- Story creates meaning.
			- ^^Coincidence^^, then would seem our enemy, for it is the random, absurd collisions of things in the universe and is, by definition, meaningless.
			- And yet coincidence is a part of life, often a powerful part, rocking existence, then vanishing as absurdly as it arrived.
			- The solution, therefore, is not to avoid coincidence, but to dramatize how it may enter life meaninglessly, but in time gain meaning, how the antilogic of randomness becomes the logic of life-as-lived.
			-
			  > **^^First^^, bring coincidence in early to allow time to build meaning out of it.**  
			- Coincidence, therefore, must not pop into a story, turn a scene, then pop out.
			- Not that coincidence couldn't happen, but it's pointless.
			- As a rule of thumb do not use coincidence beyond the midpoint of the telling.
			- Rather, put the story more and more into the hands of the characters.
			-
			  > **^^Second^^, never use coincidence to turn an ending. This is deus ex machina, the writer's greatest sin.**  
			- *^^Deus ex machina^^* is a Latin phrase taken from the classical theatres of Greece and Rome, meaning 'god from machine.'
			- ^^Aristotle^^ complained about this practice, sounding much like a Hollywood producer, 'Why can't these writers come up with endings that work?'
			- Deus ex machina not only erases all meaning and emotion, it's an insult to the audience.
			- Each of us knows we must choose and act, for better or worse, to determine the meaning of our lives.
			- NO one and nothing coincidental will come along to take that responsibility from us, regardless of the injustices and chaos around us.
			- Our lives are ultimately in our own hands.
			- Deus ex machina is an insult because it is a lie.
			-
		- ### THE PROBLEM OF COMEDY
			- Comedy writers often feel that in their wild world the principles that guide the dramatist don't apply.
			- But whether coolly satiric or madly farcical, comedy is simply another form of storytelling.
			- There are, however, important exceptions that begin in the deep division between the comic and tragic visions of life.
			- Comedy is pure: If the audience laughs, it works: if it doesn't laugh, it doesn't work.
			- The comedy writer fixates on the social life-the idiocy, arrogance, and brutality in society.
			- The comedy writer singles out a particular institution that he feels has become encrusted with hypocrisy and folly, then goes on the attack.
			- Often we can spot the social institution under assault by nothing the film's title.
			- When a society cannot ridicule and criticize its institutions, it cannot laugh.
			- To solve the problem of weak comedy, therefore, the writer first asks: What am I angry about?
			- He finds the aspect of society that heats his blood and goes on an assult.
			- ### Comic Design
				- In drama the audience continuously grabs handfuls of the future, pulling themselves through, wanting to know the outcome.
				- But *Comedy* allows the writer to halt *^^Narrative Drive^^,* the forward projecting mind of the audience, and interpolate into the telling a scene with no story purpose.
				- Comedy tolerates more coincidence than drama, and may even allow a *deus ex machina* ending.
				- The incisive difference between comedy and drama is this: Both turn scenes with surprise and insight, but in comedy, when the Gap cracks open, the surprise explodes the great belly  laughs of the night.
				- Simply put, a *^^Comedy^^* is a funny story, an elaborate rolling joke.
				- While wit lightens a telling, it doesn't alone make it a true *Comedy.*
				- Gags come naturally when the comic structure calls for them.
				- Instead, concentrate on Turning Points.
				- For each action first ask, 'What's the opposite of that?' then take it a step farter to 'What's off-the-wall from that?'
				- Spring gaps of comic surprise-write a funny *story.*
				-
		- ### THE PROBLEM OF POINT OF VIEW
			- For the screenwriter *^^Point of View^^* has two meanings.
			- First, we occasionally call for POV shots.
			- The second meaning, however, applies to the writer's vision.
			- From what Point of View is each scene written?
			- From what Point of View is the story as a whole told?
			- ### POV Within a Scene
				- Each story is set in a specific time and place, yet scene by scene, as we imagine events, where do we locate ourselves *^^in space^^* to view the action?
				- This is ^^Point of View^^-the physical angle we take in order to describe the behavior of our characters, their interaction with one another and the environment.
				- How we make our choices of Point of View has enormous influence on how the reader reacts to the scene and how the director will later stage and shoot it.
				- We can imagine ourselves anywhere 360 degrees around an action or at the center of the action looking out in 360 different degrees--high above the action, below it, anywhere globally.
				- Each choice of POV has a different effect on empathy and emotion.
			- ### POV Within the Story
				- The easy way to hopscotch through time and space, picking up bits and pieces to facilitate exposition, but this makes story sprawl and lose tension.
				- Like limited setting, genre convention, and Controlling Idea, shaping a story from the exclusive ^^Point of View^^ of the protagonist is a creative discipline.
				- It taxes the imagination and demands your very best work.
				- The result is a tight, smooth, memorable character and story.
				-
				  > **The more time spent with a character, the more opportunity to witness his choices. The result is more empathy and emotional involvement between audience and character.**  
		- ### THE PROBLEM WITH ADAPTATION
			- The conceit of adaptation is that the hard work of story can be avoided by optioning a literary work and simply shifting it to screenplay.
			- This is almost never the case.
			- To grasp the difficulties of adaptation we look again at story complexity.
			- In the twentieth century we now have three media for telling story: prose (novel, novella, short story), theatre (legit, musical, opera, mime, ballet), and screen (film and television).
			- Each medium tells complex stories by bringing characters into simultaneous conflict on all three levels of life; however, each has a distinctive power and innate beauty at *one* of these levels.
			- The unique strength and wonder of the novel is the dramatization of inner conflict.
			- This is what prose does best, far better than play or film.
			- Whether in first- or third-person, the novelist slips inside thought and feeling with subtlety, density, and poetic imagery to project onto the reader's imagination the turmoil and passions of inner conflict.
			- In the novel extra-personal conflict is delineated through description, word pictures of characters struggling with society or environment, while personal conflict is shaped through dialogue.
			- The unique command and grace of the theatre is the dramatization of personal conflict.
			- In the theatre inner conflict is dramatized through subtext.
			- The unique power and splendor of the cinema is the dramatization of extra-personal conflict, huge and vivid images of human beings wrapped inside their society and environment, striving with life.
			- To express personal conflict the screenwriter must use plain spoken dialogue.
			- Film, howver, gains great power in nonverbal communication.
			- With close-up, lighting, and nuances of angle, gestures, and facial expressions become very eloquent.
			- Nonetheless, the screenwriter cannot dramatize personal conflict to the poetic fullness of the theatre.
			- The dramatization of inner conflict on screen is exclusively in the subtext as the camera looks through the face of the actor to thoughts and feelings within.
			- That is the lay of the land.
			- Now imagine the problems of adaptation.
			- Therefore, the first principle of adaptation: ^^**The purer the novel, the purer the play, the worse the film.**^^
			- 'Literary purity' does not mean literary achievement.
			- Purity of novel means a telling located exclusively at the level of inner conflict, employing linguistic complexities to incite, advance, and climax story with relative independence of personal, social, and environmental forces.
		- ### THE PROBLEM OF MELODRAMA
			- To avoid the accusation 'This script is melodramatic,' many avoid writing 'big scenes,' passionate, powerful events.
			- Anything you can imagine human beings doing, they have already done and in ways you cannot imagine.
			- None of this is melodrama; it's simply human.
			- ^^Melodrama^^ is not the result of overexpression, but of under motivation; not writing too big, but writing with too little desire.
			- The power of an event can only be as great as the sum total of its causes.
			- We feel a scene is melodramatic if we cannot believe that motivation matches action.
			- If you can imagine high drama or comedy, write it, but lift the forces that drive your characters to equal or surpass the extremities of their actions and we'll embrace you for taking us to the end of the line.
		- ### THE PROBLEM OF HOLES
			- A '^^hole^^' is another way to lose credibility.
			- Rather than a lack of motivation, now the story lacks logic, a missing link in the chain of cause and effect.
			- But like coincidence, holes are a part of life.
			- Things often happen for reasons that cannot be explained.
			- So if you're writing about life, a hole or two may find its way into your telling.
			- The problem is how to handle it.
			- If you can forge a link between illogical events and close the hole, do so.
			- This remedy, however, requires the creation of a new scene that has no purpose other than making what's around it logical, causing an awkwardness as annoying as the hole.
			- In which case ask: Will they notice?
			- You know it's a jump in logic because the story sits still on your desk with its hole glaring up at you.
			- But onscreen the story flows in time.
			- As the hole arrives, the audience may not have sufficient information at that point to realize that what just happened isn't logical or it may happen so quickly, it passes unnoticed.
			- So maybe the audience won't notice. But maybe it will.
			- Then what?
			- Cowardly writers try to kick sand over such holes and hope the audience doesn't notice.
			- Other writers face this problem manfully.
			- They expose the hole to the audience, then deny that it is a hole.
	- ## 17 CHARACTER
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### THE MIND WORM
			- To discuss psychology, medieval scholarship devised another ingenious conceit: the ^^*Mind Worm.*^^
			- Suppose a creature had the power to burrow into the brain and come to know an individual completely-dreams, fears, strength, weakness.
			- Suppose that this Mind Worm also had the power to cause events in the world.
			- It could then create a specific happening geared to the unique nature of the person that would trigger a one-of-a-kind adventure, a quest that would force him to use himself to the limit, to live his deepest and fullest.
			- Whether a tragedy or fulfillment, this quest would reveal his humanity absolutely.
			- The writer is a Mind Worm.
			- We too burrow into a character to discover his aspects, his potential, then create an event geared to his unique nature--the Inciting Incident.
			- For each protagonist it's different--for one perhaps finding a fortune, for another losing a fortune--but we design the event to fit the character, the precise happening needed to send him on a quest that reaches the limits of his being.
			- As ^^William Faulkner^^ observed, human nature is the only subject that doesn't date.
			- ### Characters Are Not Human Beings
				- A character is no more a human being than Venus de Milo is a real woman.
				- A ^^character^^ is a work of art, a  metaphor for human nature.
				- We relate to characters as if they were real, but they're superior to reality.
				- Their aspects are designed to be clear and knowable; whereas our fellow humans are difficult to understand, if not enigmatic.
				- We know characters better than we know our friends because a character is eternal and unchanging, while people shift---just when we think we understand them, we don't.
				- Character design begins with an arrangement of the two primary aspects: *^^Characterization^^*and *^^True Character^^.*
				- To repeat: Characterization is the sub of all observable qualities, a combination that make the character unique: physical appearance coupled with mannerisms, style of speech and gesture, sexuality, age, IQ, occupation, personality, attitudes, values, where he lives, how he lives.
				- True Character waits behind this mask.
				- Despite his characterization, at heart who is this person?
				- Loyal or Disloyal? Honest or a liar? Loving or cruel? etc.
				-
				  > **^^TRUE CHARACTER^^ can only be expressed through choice in dilemma. How the person chooses to act under pressure is who he is--the greater the pressure, the truer and deeper the choice to character.**  
				- The key to True Character is desire.
				- A character comes to life the moment we glimpse a clear understanding of his desire-not only the conscious, but in a complex role, the unconscious desire as well.
				- Ask: What does this character want?
				- Now? Soon? Overall? Knowingly? Unknowingly?
				- With clear, true answers comes your command of the role.
				- Behind desire is motivation.
				- Why does your character want what he wants?
				- You have your ideas about motive, but don't be surprised if others see it differently.
				- A friend may feel that parental upbringing shaped your character's desires; someone else may think it's our materialistic culture; another may blame the school system....etc.
				- Contemporary attitudes tend to favor mono-explanations for behavior, rather than the complexity of forces that's more likely the case.
				- Do not reduce characters to case studies (an episode of child abuse is the cliché in vogue at the moment), for in truth there are no definitive explanations for anyone's behavior.
				- *Generally, the more the writer nails motivation to specific causes, the more he diminishes the character in the audience's mind.*
				- Rather, think through to a solid understanding of motive, but at the same time leave some mystery around the whys, a touch of the irrational perhaps, room for the audience to use its own life experience to enhance your character in its imagination.
				- The audience comes to understand your character in a variety of ways: The physical image and setting say a lot, but the audience knows that appearance is not reality, characterization is not true character.
				- Nonetheless, a character's mask is an important clue to what may be revealed.
				- What other characters say about a character is a hint.
				- What a character says about himself may or may not be true.
				- Characters with lucid self-knowledge are not only boring but phony.
				- The audience knows that people rarely, if ever, understand themselves, and if they do, they're incapable of complete and honest self-explanation.
				- There's always a subtext.
				- Self-explanation must be validated or contradicted in action.
				-
			- ### Character Dimension
				- '^^Dimension^^' is the least understood concept in character.
				- When I was an actor, directors would insist on 'round, three-dimensional characters,' and I was all for that, but when I asked them what exactly is a dimension and how do I create one, let alone three, they'd waffle something mumbling about rehearsal, then stroll away.
				- Decorating a protagonist with quirks does not open his character and draw empathy.
				- Rather, eccentricities may close him off and keep us at a distance.
				- A favorite academic tenet argues that, instead, fine characters are marked by one dominant trait.
				- Macbeth's ambition is frequently cited.
				- Overwhelming ambition, it's claimed, makes Macbeth great.
				- This theory is dead wrong.
				- If Macbeth were merely ambitions, there'd be no play.
				- Macbeth is a brilliantly realized character because of the contradiction between his ambition on one hand and his guilt on the other.
				- From this profound inner contradiction springs his passion, his complexity, his poetry.
				- *Dimension means contradiction:* either within deep character (guilt-ridden ambition) or between characterization and deep character (a charming thief.)
				- These contradictions must be *^^consistent^^.*
				- Dimensions fascinate; contradictions in nature or behavior rivet the audience's concentration.
				- Therefore, the protagonist must be the most dimensional character in the cast to focus empathy on the star role.
				- If not, the Center of Good decenters; the fictional universe flies apart; the audience loses balance.
			- ### Cast Design
				- In essence, the protagonist creates the rest of the cast.
				- All other characters are in the story first and foremost because of the relationship they strike to the protagonist and the way each helps to delineate the dimensions of the protagonist's complex nature.
				- Consider this hypothetical protagonist:
					- He's amusing and optimistic, then morose and cynical; he's compassionate, then cruel; fearless, then fearful.
				- This four-dimensional role needs a cast around him to delineate his contradictions, characters toward whom he can act and react in different ways at different times and places.
				- These supporting characters must round him out so that his complexity is both consistent and credible.
				- Character A, for example provokes the protagonist's sadness and cynicism, while Character B brings out his witty, hopeful side.
				- Character C inspires his loving and courageous emotions, while Character D forces him to cower in fear, then to strike out in fury.
				- The creation and design of characters A, B, C, and D, is dictated by the needs of the protagonist.
				- They are what they are principally to make clear and believable, through action and reaction, the complexity of the central role.
				- Although supporting roles must be scaled back from the protagonist, they too may be complex.
				- Character A could be two dimensional: outwardly beautiful and loving/inwardly grotesque as choices under pressure reveal cold, mutated desires.
				- Even one dimension can create an excellent supporting role.
				- Character B could, like the Terminator, have a single yet fascinating contradiction: machine versus human.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669981574712_0.png)
				- The physical and social world in which a character is found, his or her profession or neighborhood, for example, is an aspect of characterization.
				- ^^Dimension^^, therefore, can be created by a simple counterpoint:
				- Placing a conventional personality against an exotic background, or a strange, mysterious individual within an ordinary, down-to-earth society immediately generates interest.
				- Big parts should be drawn deliberately flat...but not dull.
				- Give each a freshly observed trait that makes the role worth playing for the moment the actor's onscreen, but no more.
				- Don't cause false anticipation by making bit parts more interesting than necessary.
				- The cast orbits around the star, its protagonist.
				- Supporting roles are inspired by the central character and designed to delineate his complex of dimensions.
				- Secondary roles need not only the protagonist but one another, to bring out their dimensions.
				- As tertiary characters (E and F on the diagram) have scenes with the protagonist or other principals, they also help reveal dimensions.
				- Ideally, in every scene each character brings out qualities that mark the dimensions of the others, all held in constellation by the weight of the protagonist at the center.
				-
			- ### The Comic Character
				- All characters pursue desire against forces of antagonism.
				- But the dramatic character is flexible enough to step back from the risk and realize: 'This could get me killed.'
				- Not the ^^comic character.^^
				- The comic character is marked by a blind obsession.
				- The first step to solving the problem of a character who should be funny but isn't is to find his mania.
				-
			- ### Three Tips on Writing Characters for the Screen
				- ^^1. Leave room for the actor.^^
				- ^^2. Fall in love with all your characters.^^
					- We often see films with a cast of excellent characters...except one, who's dreadful.
					- Embrace all your creations, especially the bad people.
					- They deserve love like everyone else.
					- Sociopaths are the most charming folks we ever meet-sympathetic listeners who seem so deeply concerned about our problems while they lead us to hell.
				- ^^3. Character is self-knowledge.^^
					- *Everything I learned about human nature I learned from me.* - Anton Chekov
					- Where do we find our characters?
					- Partly through observation.
					- We borrow bits and pieces of humanity, raw chunks of imagination and observation from wherever they're found, assemble them into dimensions of contradiction, then round them into the creatures we call characters.
					- Observation is our source of characterizations, but understanding of deep character is found in another place.
					- The root of all fine character is writing self-knowledge.
					- The more you penetrate the mysteries of your own humanity, the more you come to understand yourself, the more you are able to understand others.

	- ## 18 THE TEXT
		- ### DIALOGUE
		  collapsed:: true
			- All the creativity and labor that goes into designing story and character must finally be realized on the page.
			- This chapter looks at the text, at dialogue and description, and the craft guides their writing.
			- Beyond text, it examines the poetics of story, the Image Systems embedded in words that ultimately result in filmic images that enrich meaning and emotion.
			-
			  > Dialogue is not conversation.  
			- Real conversation sucks
			- The text is not the subtext.
			- What is said and done is not what is thought and felt.
			- The scene is not about what it seems to be about.
			- Screen dialogue, therefore, must have the swing of everyday talk but content well above normal.
			- First, ^^screen dialogue requires^^ compression and economy.
			- Screen dialogue must say the maximum in the fewest possible words.
			- Second, ^^it must have direction.^^
			- Each exchange of dialogue must turn the beats of the scene in one direction or another across the changing behaviors, without repetition.
			- Third, it should have purpose.
			- Each line or exchange of dialogue executes a step in design that builds and arcs a scene around its Turning Point.
			- All this precision, yet it must sound like talk, using an informal and natural vocabulary, complete with contractions, slag and even, if necessary, profanity.
			- 'Speak as common people do,' ^^Aristotle^^ advised, 'but think as wise men do.'
			- Remember, film is not a novel; dialogue is spoken and gone.
			- The ^^aesthetics of film are^^ 80 percent visual, 20 percent auditory.
			- ^^Theatre is^^ 80 percent auditory, 20 percent visual.
			- Our concentration is directed through our ears, only half-looking at the page.
			- Screen dialogue demands short, simply constructed sentences--generally, a movement form noun to verb to object or form noun to verb to complement in that order.
			- The same ideas broken into a series of short, simply constructed, informally spoken sentences, and bit by bit the audience gets it.
			- Dialogue doesn't require complete sentences.
			- We don't always bother with a noun or verb.
			- Typically, as above, we drop the opening article or pronoun, speaking in phrases, even grunts.
			- Read your dialogue out loud.
			- Never write anything that calls attentions to itself as dialogue, anything that jumps off the page.
			- The moment you think you've written something that's particularly fine and literary-cut it.
				- ### Short Speeches
					- The essence of screen dialogue is what was known in Classical Greek theatre as *^^stikomythia^^* -the rapid exchange of short speeches.
					- Long speeches are antithetical with the aesthetics of cinema.
					- When the eye is bored, it leaves the screen; when it leaves the screen, you lose the audience.
					- Be very judicious about writingn long speeches.
					- There's no such thing in life as a monologue.
					- Life is dialogue, action/reaction.
					- To understand film aesthetics you must break long speeches into patterns of action/reaction that shape the speaker's behavior.
					- Fragment the speech with silent reactions that cause the speaker to change the beat.
					- A character can react to himself, to his own thoughts, and emotions.
					- That too is part of the scene's dynamics.
					- Demonstrating on the page the action/reaction patterns within characters, between characters, between characters and the physical world projects the sensation of watching a film into the reader's imagination and makes the reader understand that yours is not a film of talking heads.
				- ### The Suspense Sentence
					- Excellent film dialogue tends to shape itself into the periodic sentence.
					- The periodic sentence is the '^^suspense sentence.'^^
					- Its meaning is delayed until the very last word, forcing both actor and audience to listen to the end of the line.
				- ### The Silent Screenplay
					- The best advice for writing film dialogue is *^^don't^^.*
					- Lean dialogue, in relief against what's primarily visual, has silence and power.
					- Alfred Hitchcock once remarked, 'When the screenplay has been written *^^and the dialogue has been added,^^* we're ready to shoot.'
					- Image is our first choice, dialogue the regretful second choice.
					- Dialogue is the last layer we *add* to the screenplay.
					- Make no mistake, we all love great dialogue, but less is more.
					- When a highly imagistic film shifts to dialogue, it crackles with excitement and delights the ear.
					-
		- ### DESCRIPTION
		  collapsed:: true
			- ### Putting a Film in the Reader's Head
				- Pity the poor screenwriter, for he cannot be a poet.
				- He cannot use metaphor and simile, assonance and alliteration, rhythm and rhyme, synecdoche and metonymy, hyperbole and meiosis, the grand tropes.
				- Instead, his work must contain all the substance of literature but not be literary.
				- A literary work is finished and complete within itself.
				- A screenplay waits for the camera.
				- If not literature, what then is the screenwriter's ambition?
				- To describe in such a way that as the reader turns pages, a film flows through the imagination.
				- Ninety percent of all verbal expression has no filmic equivalent.
				- So we constantly discipline the imagination with this question: What do I see on the screen?
				- Then describe only what is ^^photographic^^.
			- ### Vivid Action in the Now
				- ^^The ontology of the screen^^ is *an absolute present tense in constant vivid movement.*
				- We write screenplay in the present tense because, unlike the novel, film is on the knife edge of the now--whether we flash back or forward, we jump to a new *now.*
				- On the page vividness springs from the names of things.
				- Nouns are the names of objects; verbs the names of actions.
				- To write vividly, avoid generic nouns and verbs with adjectives and adverbs attached and seek the name of the thing.
				- Not 'The carpenter uses a big nail,' but 'The carpenter hammers a *spike*.'
				- The same applies to verbs.
				- A typical line of nondescription: 'He starts to move slowly across the room.' How does somebody 'start' across a room on film?
				- The character either takes a step and stops.
				- And 'move slowly?'
				- 'Slowly' is an adverb; 'move' a vague, bland verb.
				- Instead, name the action: 'He pads across the room.' (ambles, strolls, moseys, saunters, drags himself, etc.)
				- All are slow but each vivid and distinctively different than others.
				- Eliminate 'is' and 'are' throughout.
				- Onscreen nothing is in a state of being; story life is an unending flux of change, of becoming.
				- Not: 'There is a big house on a hill above a small town.'
				- Perhaps: 'A mansion guards the headlands above the village.'
				- Fine film description requires an imagination and a vocabulary.
				- Eliminate all metaphor and simile that cannot pass this test: 'What do I see (or hear) onscreen?'
				- 'As if,' for example, is a trope that doesn't exist onscreen.
				- A character doesn't come through the door 'as if.'
				- He comes through the door--period.
				- Eliminate 'we see' and 'we hear.'
				- 'We' doesn't exist.
				- Eliminate all camera and editing notations.
				- The contemporary screenplay is a *Master Scene* work that includes only those angles absolutely necessary to the telling of the story and no more.
				-
		- ### IMAGE SYSTEMS
			- ### The Screenwriter  As  Poet
				- Film is a magnificent medium for the poet's soul, once the screenwriter understands the nature of story *poetics* and its workings within a film.
				- Poetic does not mean pretty.
				- Rather, poetic means an ^^*enhanced expressivity.*^^
				- To begin with, as audience in the ritual of story, we react to every image, visual or auditory, symbolically.
				- The storyteller then builds on this natural inclination in the audience.
				- The first step in turning a well-told story into a poetic work is to exclude 90 percent of reality.
				- The vast majority of objects in the world have the wrong connotations for any specific film.
				- So the spectrum of possible imagery must be sharply narrowed to those objects with appropriate implications.
				- Like all works of art, a film is a unity in which every object relates to every other image or object.
				- Limited to what's appropriate, the writer then empowers the film with an *Image System,* or systems, for there are often more than one.
				-
				  > **An ^^IMAGE SYSTEM^^ is a strategy of motifs, a category of imagery embedded in the film that repeats in sight and sound from beginning to end with persistence and great variation, but with equally great subtlety, as a subliminal communication to increase the depth and complexity of aesthetic emotion.**  
				- '^^Category^^' means a subject drawn from the physical world that's broad enough to contain sufficient variety.
				- For example, a ^^dimension of nature^^--animals, the seasons, light and dark-or a dimension of human culture--buildings, machines, art.
				- This category must repeat because one or two isolated symbols have little effect.
				- But the power of an organized return of images is immense, as variety and repetition drive the Image System to the seat of the audience's unconsciousness.
				- Yet, *and most important,* a film's poetics must be handled with virtual invisibility and go consciously unrecognized.
				- An ^^Image system^^ is created one of two ways, via External or Internal Imagery.
				- ^^External Imagery^^ takes a category that outside the film already has a symbolic meaning and brings it n to mean the same thing in the film it means outside the film: for example, to use the national flag--a symbol of patriotism and love of country-to mean patriotism, love of country.
				- External Imagery, I must point out, is the hallmark of the student film.
				- ^^Internal Imagery^^ takes a category that outside the film may or may not have a symbolic meaning attached but brings it into the film to give an entirely new meaning appropriate to this film and this film alone.
				- An Image System *must be* subliminal.
				- The audience is not to be aware of it.
				- Symbolism is powerful, more powerful than most realize, as long as it bypasses the conscious mind and slips into the unconscious.
				- As it does while we dream.
				- The use of symbolism follows the same principle as scoring film.
				- ^^Symbols^^ touch us and move us-*as long as we don't recognize them as symbolic.*
				- Awareness of a symbol turns it into a neutral, intellectual curiosity, powerless and virtually meaningless.
				- Declamatory symbolism requires no genius, just egotism ignited by misreadings of Jung and Derrida.
				- It is a vanity that demeans and corrupts the art.
				- I argue that the screenwriter should begin the film's Image System and the director and designers finish it.
				- If an Image System doesn't arrive on its own, we invent one.
				- The audience won't care how we do it; it only wants the story to work.
				-
		- ### TITLES
			- A film's title is the marketing centerpiece that 'positions' the audience, preparing it for the experience ahead.
			- Screenwriters, therefore, cannot indulge in literary, nontitle titles.
			- To *^^title^^* means *to name.*
			- An effective title points to something solid that is actually in the story-character, setting, theme, or genre.
			- The beset titles often name two or all elements at once.
			- A title, of course, isn't the only marketing consideration.
		-
	- ## 19 A WRITER'S METHOD
		- Professional writers may or may not receive critical acclaim, but they're in control of their craft, have access to their talent, improve their performance over the years, and make a living form the art.
		- A struggling writer may at times produce quality, but from day to day he cannot make his talent perform when and as he wants, doesn't progress in quality from story to story, and receives little, if any, income from his efforts.
		- On the whole, the difference between those who succeed and those who struggle is their opposed methods of work: inside out versus outside in.
		- ### WRITING FROM THE OUTSIDE IN
			- The struggling writer tends to have a way of working that goes something like this: He dreams up an idea, noodles on it for a while, then rushes straight to the keyboard.
			- Description, description, etc.
			- The writer blames the Philistine tastes of Hollywood and gears up for his next project.
		- ### WRITING FROM THE INSIDE OUT
			- Successful writers tend to use the reverse process.
			- If, hypothetically and optimistically, a screenplay can be written from first idea to last draft in six months, these writers typically spend the first four of those six months writing on stacks of three-by-five cards: a stack for each act-three, four, perhaps more.
			- On these cards they create the story's *^^step-outline.^^*
			- ### Step-Outline
				- As the term implies, a ^^step-outline^^ is the story told in steps.
				- Using one- or two-sentence statements, the writer simply and clearly describes what happens in each scene, how it builds and turns.
				- On the back of each card the writer indicates what step in the design of the story he sees this scene fulfilling-at least for the moment.
				- Which scenes set up the Inciting Incident?
				- What is the ^^Inciting Incident?^^
				- ^^First Act Climax?^^
				- He does this for ^^Central Plo^^t and subplots alike.
				- He confines himself to a few stacks of cards for months on end for this critical reason: He wants to destroy his work.
				- Taste and experience tell him that 90 percent of everything he writes, regardless of his genius, is mediocre at best.
				- In his patient search for quality, he must create far more material than he can use, then destroy it.
				- A writer secure in his talent knows there's no limit to what he can create, and so he trashes everything else less than his best on a quest for a gem-quality story.
				- This process, however, doesn't mean the writer isn't filling pages.
				- Research and imaginings of all kinds fill a file cabinet while the story is disciplined to the step-outline.
				- Finally, after weeks or months, the writer discovers his Story Climax.
				- The writer never shows his step-outline to people because it's a tool, too cryptic for anyone but the writer to follow.
				- Any story pitched from its step-outline to an intelligent, sensitive person must be able to grab attention, hold interest for ten minutes, and pay it off moving him to a meaningful, emotional experience.
				- Everything that's wrong with it in a ten-minute pitch is ten times worse on screen.
				- Until a good majority of listeners respond with enthusiasm, there's no point in going forward.
				- Now the writer's ready to move to the next stage-the treatment.
			- ### Treatment
				- To 'treat' the step-outline, the writer expands each scene from its one or two sentences to a paragraph or more of double-spaced, present-tense, moment by moment description.
				-
				  > *In ^^treatment^^ the writer indicates what characters talk about-'he wants her to do this, but she refuses,' for example-but never writes dialogue. Instead, he creates the subtext-the true thoughts and feelings underneath what is said and done. We may think we know what our characters are thinking and feeling, but we don't know we know until w write it down.*  
				- The forty to sixty scenes of a typical screenplay, treated to a moment by moment description of all action, underlaid with a full subtext of the conscious and unconscious thoughts and feelings of all characters, will produce sixty, eight, ninety, or more double-spaced pages.
				- The ten- or twelve-page 'treatments' that pass around show business today are not treatments but outlines given enough words that a reader can follow the story.
				- A ten-page outline is not nearly enough material for a screenplay.
				- Today's writers may not return to the vast treatments of the studio system, but when a step-outline is expanded to a treatment of sixty to ninety pages, creative achievement expands correspondingly.
				- At the treatment stage, we inevitably discover that things we thought would work a certain way in the step-outline now want to change.
				- That done, then and only then does the writer move to the screenplay itself.
		- ### SCREENPLAY
			- Writing a ^^screenplay^^ from a thorough treatment is a joy and often runs at a clip of five to ten pages per day.
			- We now convert treatment description to screen description and add dialogue.
			- At the first draft stage, changes and revisions will still be needed.
			- You must develop your judgement and taste, a nose for your own bad writing, then call upon a relentless courage to root out weakness and turn them into strengths.
			- If you shortcut the process and rush straight from screenplay from outline, the truth is that your first draft is not a screenplay, its a surrogate treatment-a narrow, unexplored, unimprovised, tissue-thin treatment.
			- The wise writer puts off the writing of dialogue for as long as possible because the *premature writing of dialogue chokes creativity.*
			- Writing from the outside in-writing dialogue in search of scenes, writing scenes in search of story-*is the least creative method.*
			- Screenwriters habitually overvalue dialogue because they're the only words we write that actually reach the audience.
			- All improvisation ceases and our so-called rewriting is tinkering with speeches.
			- What's more, the premature writing of dialogue is the slowest way to work.
			- As I offer this method to you, I'm fully aware that each of us, by trial and error, must find our own method, that indeed some writers short-cut the treatment stage and produce quality screenplays, and that in fact a few have written brilliance from the outside in.
			- For the inside-out method is a way of working that's both disciplined and free, designed to encourage your finest work.
