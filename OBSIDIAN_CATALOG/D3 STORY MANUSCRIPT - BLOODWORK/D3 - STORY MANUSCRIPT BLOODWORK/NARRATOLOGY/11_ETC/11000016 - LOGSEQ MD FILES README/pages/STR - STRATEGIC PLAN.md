								- That being, Uranium-235 to a Nuclear Powerplant
								- It is a *fusion* nuclear power plant
								- What I have put into Radiolaria has the potential to power a method of prose for generations.
								- Rooted in literature and academia, open source, it, in fact, will be.
								- But like a Nuclear Power Plant, it is not the shit in it that makes it power the world, its the people who run it, and the *one who built the reactor*
							- **The Skipper - AKA**
								- Me. And whoever is in charge in absence at The Plant
								- The Plant is effectively the physical space in which LSPW Personnel interact with the Strange Container
								- The Skipper, like the captain of a ship, is in charge when on deck.
								- On deck, as in, physically present.
								- IE: The Skipper basically lives there.
								- Prime creator, contact, and communicator with the Strange Container.
								- All Skippers must earn XXX Rating Qualification with the DCV to properly get gaping hole dug out
						- Brand Reputation
						- Knowledge
						- Organizational Culture
							- The Skipper somewhat believes that amongst his immediate peers he is regarded as
								- a poetic, relentless, clever, coomer, a narrative wundermaester.
								- culture that supports behavior that is: genuine,  gracious, empathetic, optimistic, interesting
								- cultural behavior expressed uniquely by the skipper: enthusiastic, witty, supportive, confident,
								- unfortunately, the skipper can manic, cruel, and shameful, judgmental, and dismissive.
								- At worst, the Skipper displays traits of Narcissism, specifically,
									- Grandiose Narcissism: This type of narcissism is characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, an intense need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others.
									- Collective Narcissism: This type of narcissism involves an excessive preoccupation with the perceived greatness or superiority of one's group or community. Individuals with collective narcissism may exhibit an exaggerated sense of group identity, a tendency to devalue those outside the group, and a belief in the inherent superiority of the group.
									- Cerebral Narcissism: This type of narcissism involves an excessive focus on one's own intelligence or intellectual achievements. Individuals with cerebral narcissism may exhibit a sense of superiority based on their intellectual abilities or knowledge, and may devalue or dismiss those who do not share their interests or views.
									- Communal Narcissism: This type of narcissism involves an excessive focus on one's own generosity, kindness, and helpfulness toward others. Individuals with communal narcissism may exhibit a sense of superiority based on their perceived selflessness or altruism, and may expect recognition or admiration for their charitable acts.
									- Professional Narcissism: This type of narcissism involves an excessive focus on one's own professional achievements, status, and reputation. Individuals with professional narcissism may prioritize their career over other aspects of their life, and may have difficulty accepting criticism or feedback.

					- ** Resource Evaluation**
						- **Tangible Resources**
							- Value Chain Equipment Resources
								- Evaluation
									- When it comes to reaching campaign 2 tier goals of generating income through text publication, I am set.
									- In terms of creating a secondary income stream through publication of screen video, audio, or other creative digital products, I am also set for this.
									- Growth, however is an issue. The biggest hurdle is the barrier to entry when it comes to efficient 3D animation is the hardware technology necessary to research, analyze, and create a system that is robust yet lean.
									- General suggestion to overcome this hurdle is to
										- take advantage of the unique equipment resources to leverage creative knowledge content
										- create value chains/funnels that lead to terminates with youtube content
										- avoid complex funnels that incorporate multiple sources of income such as patreon, courses, ebooks, etc.
										- keep the product simple, cast a wide net etc.
										- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING - 2/5^^
							- Intellectual Property Depth and Growth Resources
								- Enough resources to manufacture the a robust radiolacra
								- Enough research to stress test/refine Strange Maester Bathala
								- The greatest asset for Leechseed is the wealth of already collected data, tests, ideas, etc.
								- The great hurdle is the processing of all the information into a dataset that correlates with the radiolacra/Bathala
								- As if, with anything, time is the greatest hurdle.
								- General suggestion
									- continue to casually document in the logseq journal
									- ULTRAPROSE can funnel data steadily by learning how
										- queries work in logseq
										- using tags to slowly funnel relevant shit into ultraprose
										- i can solve a lot of the digital legwork such as evernote, lost docs, etc thru background researching using chatgpt
										- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING 3/5^^
							- Digital Asset Storage, Access, and Distribution
								- This hardware will be useful in collecting anecdotal digital resources for Strange Maester Bathala
								- Hardware may also be useful for rudimentary 3D video production beyond the radiolaria such as setting up a homelab server or whatnot.
								- however the barrier to entry when it comes to this is fucking knowledge heap.
								- Current Suggestion, not very useful currently. Should disconnect the PC I have plugged in now.
								- Seriously consider a safe method of deep storage for the one franken PC.
								- **I should probably get a cheap case, refirb it, and store it properly.**
								- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING: 4/5^^
								- **A Media Plex Drive, and a method of organizing all the videos, photos, could be a good background experiential existential toe dip into the wild world of homelabs.**
								- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING: 2/5^^
							- General office Operations Equipment
								- Growth for adding a physical stakeholder/partner or physical contract hire or just anything that has to do with meeting physically with up to ideally max 4 people for business is a primo setup.
								- Unless they're not into the coomer aesthetic. In that case that's their problem.
								- General Suggestions
									- **I should create a stakeholder visit protocol whenever I get the chance, basically the necessary steps that must be executed before any sort of collaboration visit with a coomerphobic stakeholder.**
									- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING 1/5^^
							- Lead Pursuit and Mobility
								- Traveling should be considered a priority strength when it comes to planning anything strategic.
								- While cash is not on hand, I do have the availability of family liquidity injection with good reason and a large gap of notification
								- General Suggestion
									- The  great thing holding me back though is the digital integration of synching information. I at least need to create some sort of rudimentary contingency task list, otherwise travel may instead introduce an unnecessary hurdle in transferring data into a dataset for processing at the least opportune time
									- **I'm sure by now there is something that supports multiple user access to one logseq or something. Or, I just need to create another gitrepo system in which i upload/dl git repos for later processing. something like that**
									- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING 4/5^^
							- Personal Composure and Health
								- I think of this as necessary equipment when delving into 3D motion capture.
								- I really want to explore that area to inform a method that empowers both the efficiency and accuracy of motion capture while also enabling stylistic and creative dexterity in traditional/digital roto animating
								- I mean honestly I should just start hopping on that motherfucking rowing machine
								- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING 2/5^^
