- to tackle a complex topic we must break it down into smaller components.
- We must atomize it.
- However, very complex topics are not only materially a lot of stuff, it is also very dense.
- Processing these topics takes more than most consuming the information we must digest it fully.
- Think of a complex topic like a salt lick or a fucking massive mountain of marble.
- When we are tackling a complex topic, break down and illustrate the topic as a branching iceberg meme.
- Branch further and further till it's atomized. Fully atomized, we can start designing and building.
- It takes a lot of time to process a mountain. however long it takes to understand it do it.

- Imagine the scene where he is pushed to his limit and goes to fight her in the bathroom.  instead she pins him to the wall and chokes him. He's tearing up and goes full tempter tantrum and starts sobbing.
- For a second he was in his own world. He forgot the girl was there, that the grip on his neck was the pressure he felt every day of his life.

That instead zircon is actually a fakenintellegince spy network collected by NSA ground agents. That infact it was a scam. The British deny. In reality it was a psyops by the two working together to create an elaborate dungeons and dragons like fiction for losers to do. In fact, it was fun at first, but it actually lead to a cold war between NSA weebs and 4chan. Alex Jones himself is actually an unwilling psychotic shill to feed an outlandish yet narratively exciting pseudofiction.

  What is duality?  
  Two simple opposing concepts held together in cognition.  
- What is depth?
- A duality where each opposing concept is broken down into a simple shape model of components. (Line, Triangle, square)
- Circle - a model used to represent  a container in which duality and depth models are held. The purpose of which is to visually represent simple models held in cognition. By doing so, causal, fuzzy, and other relationships between pimp concepts can be realized. Thus creating complex relationships/concepts with deep believable justification.

- Massive Watch movements as space ships. Quartz crystal or synthetic rubies used as heat sinks.

- Submafia - a couple gets pissed of getting hoodwinked and scammed at every turn. So they build a network of trusted friends to do business with. Their plan takes off. the network grows, and with a bit of commission off the top the two grow an empire. a community of specialties, skills, and moral citizens turn their destiny away from the breach. From the shadows they emerge into lifestyle that calls attention. A place unfamiliar. A home far away. Neighbors grow sus while whispers and rumor spread. Old gods are  into wild and unwieldy   The gaze of a greater power descends to exert it's will. Blinded by hubris the mafia is ambushed. Powered by generations of wealth the gaze is cruel, jealous, and vain. Vowed to crush all under a wicked fist, those that challenge it's position, the gaze does not abide. Faced with destruction, the couple return to form with a dilemma. Once prey, now wiser,  the couple  offer the hoods and scammers a deal. An offer of peace in cooperarion. A promise of aid in dispair. an attack on one is an attack on all.  Once enemies in desperation now allies in prosperity
