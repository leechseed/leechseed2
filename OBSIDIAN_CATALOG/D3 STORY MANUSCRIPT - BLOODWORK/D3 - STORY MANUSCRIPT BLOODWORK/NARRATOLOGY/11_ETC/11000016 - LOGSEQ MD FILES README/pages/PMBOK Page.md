- # 1.2.3 RELATIONSHIP OF PROJECT, PROGRAM, PORTFOLIO, AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
	- ## 1.2.3.1 overview
		- A project may be managed in three separate scenarios:
			- Stand-Alone
				- Outside of a portfolio or program
			- Within a Program
			- Within a Portfolio
		- *Multiple projects may be needed to accomplish a set of goals and objectives for an organization*
		- *Program* - A group of related projects
		- *Portfolio* - Projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1651249106058_0.png)
			- The prtfolio view allows organizations see how strategic goals are reflected in the portfolio.
			- Components are prioritized based on
				- risk
				- funding
				- other considerations
		- *Program and project management focus on doing programs and projects the 'right' way*
		- *Portfolio management focuses on doing the 'right' programs and projects.*
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1651249201439_0.png)
	- ## 1.2.3.2 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
		- *Program Management* is defined as the application of knowledge, skills and principles to a program to achieve the program objectives and to obtain benefits and control not available by managing components individually.
		- *Program component* - projects and other programs within a program.
		- *Project management focuses on interdependencies within a project*
		- *Program management focuses on the interdependencies between projects and how to optimally approach managing them.*
	- ## 1.2.3.3 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
		- A *Portfolio* is defined as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.
		- *Portfolio Management* is defined as the centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic objectives.
	- ## 1.2.3.4 OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
		- *Operations Management* is an area that is outside the scope of formal project management.
			- OPS is concerned with the ongoing production of goods and/or services.
	- ## 1.2.3.5 OPERATIONS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
		- *Projects can intersect with operations at various points during the product life cycle*
	- ## 1.2.3.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT (OMP) AND STRATEGIES
		- *Portfolio management aligns* portfolios with organizational strategies by selecting the right programs or projects
		- *Program management harmonizes* its program components and controls interdependencies in order to realize specified benefits
		- *Project management enables* the achievement of organizational goals and objectives
		- *Organizational Project Management (OPM)* - is a framework in which portfolio, program, and project management are integrated with organizational enablers in order to achieve strategic objectives.

	- ## 1.2.4.1 PROJECT AND DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLES
		- *A project life cycle* is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion.
			- Project life cycles are *predictive* or *adaptive*
		- *Developmental Life Cycle* - Within a project life cycle, there are generally one or more phases that are associated with the *development of the product, service, or result*
		- *Predictive Life Cycle* - life cycle, project, scope, time, and cost are determined in the early phases of the life cycle.
		- *Iterative Life Cycle* - the project scope is generally determined early in the project life cycle, but the time and cost estimates are routinely modified as the project team's understanding of the product increases.
		- *Incremental life cycle* - the deliverable is produced thru a series of iterations that successively add functionality within a predetermined frame.
		- *Adaptive life cycle* - agile, iterative, or incremental.
		- *Hybrid Life Cycle* - combination of a predictive and adaptive life cycle.
		- ### It is up to the project management team to determine the best life cycle for each project.
			- The cycle needs to be flexible enough to deal with the variety of factors included in the project.
		- *Life cycle flexibility may be accomplished by:*
			- Identifying the process or processes needed to be performed in each phase,
			- Performing the process or processes identified in the appropriate phase,
			- Adjusting the various attributes of a phase (eg name, duration, exit criteria, and entrance criteria)
		- *Project life cycles are independent of product life cycles*
			- Product life cycles may be produced by a project.
		- *Product Life Cycle* - the series of phases that represent the evolution of a product from
			- concept
			- delivery
			- growth
			- maturity
			- retirement
	- ## 1.2.4.2 PROJECT PHASE
