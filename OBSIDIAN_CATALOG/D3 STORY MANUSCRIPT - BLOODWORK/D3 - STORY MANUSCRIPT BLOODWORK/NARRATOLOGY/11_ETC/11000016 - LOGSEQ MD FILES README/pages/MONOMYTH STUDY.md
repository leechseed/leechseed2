	- ## MYTHOLOGY THE VOYAGE OF A HERO
		- ### Leeming's interpretation of the monomyth
	- ### THE ORIGINAL 8 STEPS
		- 1) MIRACULOUS CONCEPTION AND BIRTH AND THE HIDING OF THE CHILD
		- 2) CHILDHOOD, INITIATION, AND DIVINE SIGNS
		- 3) PREPARATION, MEDITATION, WITHDRAWAL, AND REFUSAL
		- 4) TRIAL AND QUEST
		- 5) DEATH AND THE SCAPEGOAT
		- 6) THE DESCENT INTO THE UNDERWORLD
		- 7) RESURRECTION AND REBIRTH
		- 8) ASCENSCION, APOTHEOSIS, AND ATONEMENT
	- ### AUGMENTING THE FIRST STEP
	- MIRACULOUS CONCEPTION
		- The concept that the moment of life, or the introduction of the hero, is one of incredible and unlikely circumstance.
		- Conception is *an action that is performed*
			- Understand that conception is a metaphor for the beginning of the hero. The miracle is seen in action.
			- EG: In *Fall* the conception of the hero, Becky is climbing a massive mountain.
			- Conception takes place between the audience and the hero.
			- A really good fuck. Perhaps the best the audience has ever experienced.
			- An exercise in seduction, that this is a person I am *very* interested in.
	- BIRTH
		- Violent, unseemly, and most importantly, honest.
		- The *Right Brain*'s logic audit to the Left Brain's imagination.
		- Birth is the inevitable conclusion to conception.
		- It is important that whatever the emotional charge +/- of conception, birth must be an overwhelming opposite charge that forces the left brain to speculate on the commitment to the hero.
	- HIDING OF THE CHILD
		- The next step in Leeming's analogy is to protect the infant.
		- The emotional energy and physical activity that follows birth.
		- In an abstract sense, it is a moment of emotional pause.
		- It is *the way things are and the way they have been since birth*
		- EG: Coping with the trauma or protecting the child.
	- ### Reinterpreted
		- Miraculous conception is the left-brain's instinctual/emotional active interpretation of meeting the hero for the first time.
			- The design of miraculous conception must be
				- a bullish/bearish run on emotional charge +/-
				- uninhibited. A dream or a nightmare.
		- Birth is the right-brain's logical/rational reaction to the conclusion of conception.
			- The design of Birth must be
				- a complete overextended reversal of emotional charge. (an economic correction) or....
				- an overextended run that exceeds the intrinsic value of birth. (an economic bubble) or...
				- a crash resulting in an instant and dramatic drop in value. (an economic crash)
				- Cautious. The initial comprehension after the waking moment.
		- Hiding of the child is a full-brained moment of equilibrium.
			- Whatever the charge is, the price has settled, and it has settled for a while.
			- The beat can be seen as a *moment of respite* or an *momentary truce*
			- Whatever the charge is, the idea is that the hero is too comfortable and believes that what is present will be forever.
			- The hero could be lost in the moment, but what is important *the hero must be fully present in a simply universally understood moment of humanity*
	- ## Augmenting the Second Step
		- Childhood
			- Awe, butterflies, excitement, and nervousness.
			- Metaphorically its the moment that the child steps out or is pushed out of a state of tranquility.
			- EG: Stepping off the bus on the first day of school.
				- *The possibilities are endless*
			- **Be mindful of the +/- charge dynamic.**
				- If at equillibrium, the charge must shift either to +(excitement)/-(frosty)
				- Also, the +/- descriptor can be from any emotional variable.
				- Note: *reference human sexual anatomy and the steps of reproductive rituals*
		- Initiation
			- An event or gauntlet that the child must prove their worth.
				- Represented ritualistically with shit like Bar Mitzvah or Quincea√±era.
			- Death is too much. It should be seen as a *test* rather than a battle.
			- The hero must prove himself to *a representation of society or authority*
			- The action of the hero must not be seen as a binary pass/fail.
				- The writer can *Risk Matrix* possibilities.
				- One must keep in mind the *controlling idea/theme* intrinsically inseminated at conception.
		- Divine Signs
			- An bi-polar opposite charged reaction to the events of initiation.
			- A signal indicating a prediction of future events.
			- EG Idioms:
				- Storm on the Horizion
				- Light at the end of the tunnel
				- 'its hopeless'
				- 'we might make something of you yet'
