		- ## TIPS AND TRICKS
			- ### JUNGLE
				- *Objectives are Priority, because Bel'Veth can take them fast.*
				- *In TRUE FORM, Bel'Veth is VERY STRONG, and must look to gank, invade, and kill.*
				- *In TRUE FORM, Dives are Easy using the Following Combo:*
					- Q -> W -> AA -> Q -> E -> Q
					- Peel tower Aggro, and return for R stack
				- *Always look to counter jungle when enemy jungler is on opposite side*
			- ### IF FED
				- Take Objectives
				- Dive & Gank to snowball
				- Towers
				- Invade enemy jungle, kill them and/or take camps
				- Solo baron at 3 items
			- ### IF BEHIND
				- Gank winning lanes
				- Farm
		- ## EARLY GAME
			- ### Clear Combo
				- W -> AA -> AA -> Q -> AA -> AA -> Q -> AA -> AA -> E
			- ### Jungle Pathing
				- Full Clear
				- 4-5 Camp Clear -> Gank
				- **Red Side - Take W - Above and Below**
				- **Blue Side - Take E - Royal Maelstrom**
			- ### GANKS
				- Walk up - > Q -> W -> AA -> AA -> Q -> AA -> AA -> E
				- *E should be used as a finisher since it does damage based on missing health*
			- ### FIRST POWER SPIKE
				- At Level 6, it is crucial to get your True Form. Look for Opportunities
		- ## MID-GAME
			- *The Mid-Game win condition is to maintain Bel'Veth's True Form as much as possible.*
			- *Prioritize Dragon, Void Monsters, and Kills to build Bel'Veth's stacks and True Form*
			- *Buy Control Wards to secure objectives*
		- ## LATE GAME
			- *In fights, Bel'Veth must focus killing one enemy at a time to prioritize R resets*
			- *Capitalize on enemy out of position*
			- *Focus on objectives*
