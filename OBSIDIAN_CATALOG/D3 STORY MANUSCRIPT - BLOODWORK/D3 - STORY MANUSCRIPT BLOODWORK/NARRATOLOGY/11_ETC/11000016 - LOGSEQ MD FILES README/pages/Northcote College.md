- # The Northcote College Scandal
Northcote College  
- Duncan and Harry, two roommates attending the elite Northcote College are desperate for an opportunity to succeed. Unable to make the required GPA to graduate, they search for an opportunity to create a way to pay the bills, and avoid the embarrassment of returning home uneducated. 
  
  
  
  Duncan is a typical american-indian guy, reserved and humorously naive. Unexposed to drugs and alcohol before, he overdid it his last year and failed his classes in Cryptology and Economics.   
  
  
  
  Harry defines american-korean pop star. Popular, smart, attractive, the one thing that brought him down was the distructive relationship with his past girlfriend Sylvia who recently moved back to Korea to become a K-pop star. A once prolific student in Film and Web Design.   
  
  
  
  During a night of self induced inebria and highness, the guys come up with an idea to create a fake secret society called "Gold Widow or GW" after the drink (Goldschlager) and weed (White Widow) they smoked that night.   
  
  
  
  Their plan is to charge new members to be part of the society and live off the spoils, for now.   
  
  
  
  The first part of the plan is to create notoriety. Duncan hacks into the university's website system and posts a racy nude photo of the school's president on the front page. Harry designs a video press release, stating that GW is responsible attacks and is an old "secret order" resurfacing at Northcote College, and they're taking applications.   
  
  
  
  To enter, males and females must submit a video of themselves having sex with a member of another Ivy league school with some proof. Thus Proving themselves ultimate Northcote students and worthy to call themselves a Gold Widow.   
  
  
  
  After two weeks, Duncan and Harry have an unprecedented amount of amateur self made porn on their desktop and are overwhelmed by the success of the society so far.   
  
  
  
  Duncan and Harry pick their candidates and play the videos for their candidates at a "secret event" they hold. They tell the candidates that they're one more step away from beaming a Gold Widow is to bring the society cash. Only the ones who bring the most will be accepted. They have 2 days.   
  
  
  
  Duncan begins to have opposition to the ethics of the society, but Harry keeps pushing foreword. Harry pushes Duncan to make a website dedicated to the society, a raunchy "members only" porn website that charges an absorbent amount of money to view content.   
  
  
  
  WIth the return of the candidates and money, Duncan is able to rent a massive apartment which he turns into a studio. He trains the kids of GW and runs a multi-genre porn society from this apartment.   
  
  
  
  Harry locks himself in a room and works with the website, aside from its massive success, Harry finds it increasingly difficult to deal with the subject matter. He gets concerned calls from his parents and is almost sickened by some of the videos he has to upload.   
  
  
  
  Duncan tries to cheer him up. He casts him in one of the videos. Harry loves it and gets somewhat of a fandom on the website (due to his giant cock, which ironically enough Duncan always thought was small)   
  
  
  
  The business continues until Duncan and Harry decide to recruit more individuals. yet again, they hack the school website stating that they're asking of rmore members. This time however, as they're pouring through the videos, one of them takes a dangerous turn. The video submitted is borderline rape. The individual who made the video is arrested and confesses to making the tape to join Gold Widow.   
  
  
  
  Simultaneously, Duncan's parents travel to the University and find out everything, including the porn he's been in. They take him back to his home town.   
  
  
  
  Harry comes back to the apartment to see the place ransacked and empty. The place has been robbed and all GW members have left. He decides to lay low.   
  
  
  
  Duncan works back at home at his family's gas station during the late night shifts.  
  
  
  
  …and thats all i got right now. I'm thinking this is late second/third act.
