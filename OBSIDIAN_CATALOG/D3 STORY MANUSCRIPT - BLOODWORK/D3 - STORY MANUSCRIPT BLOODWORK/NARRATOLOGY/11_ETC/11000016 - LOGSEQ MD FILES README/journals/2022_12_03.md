- looking at node based editors to script leechseed story dev
	- if i can find a solution, this will solve the agility issues regarding
		- adding/removing certain properties specific to the story/stories
- Blueprints is an Unreal Engine 5 node-based graph editor
	- it can be used to illustrate flows of story development
		- stories can emerge from different standpoints based on moments of inspiration
			- a cool character
			- an interesting scene
			- a great setting
		- each one of these story birth points can require a different flow through the basic leechseed development chain.
- *node based graph editors may be the solution to get through this inspiration gap*
	- I believe its this serendipitous quality of idea generation makes fantastic stories.
		- EG: following the philosophy of McKee's *Inside Out* theory
- The greatest issue with story is its wicked quality.
- The solution is to break down its concepts into higher level areas of understanding.
- Then it should be possible to see how each of these concepts interact with each other.
- Perhaps one must choose a 'controlling' concept that guides the rest of the construction of story?
-
- I basically need a way to, in order
	- 1 break down the knowledge captured in [[0413715507 - TEXT - Story Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting by Robert McKee - 0413715507]]
	- 2 re-format the data in a knowledge-base-like format
		- this is to make the knowledge easier to process and comprehend
		- 2.1 this requires a high-level type of classification in how the knowledge
			- is defined
			- interacts with each other (tactics)
			- hierarchies
			- EG
				- basics
				- foundational knowledge
		- *once the break down is complete*
			- identify patterns of information and create *knowledge classes* for each type
