- Alright so let's meet at least 857 alright so long time no see how to get back into it one thing I really had a revelation on is how can I find a grand way to sort of incapslate all the stories that are 1 tell and 1 thing that I found was this 1 guy's incredible series on The Bible and how it is sort organize in a manner that makes sense and I never realized how complex and how intricate The Bible is more of a collection of books it's more like a 100 books and not just 1 books 1 book or an idyman 2 books it's at its hundreds of them and it's interesting how they all interact with each other and how they're all organized in a way that's comprehensible to someone who really wants to look into it and I really like the idea of that sort of complexity and the ability to sort of Ah create these connections and it also but the way he also framed it it also South sort of reflects on the idea that it is complexity there are multiple ways to really interpret that objectivity but there is enough of a thought a thought put into it of AI need to a purpose in which it all kind of makes sense not necessarily make sense but has a way to navigate and I'm trying I'm sorry to see The Bible not necessarily as something to worship but as a journey to understand And something about that really hits home with me the idea thit's more of a journey of understanding rather than read a goal to achieve and that is sort of what I want to construct with what I'm quite a journey for any white and dumb I'm dirty's moments within the movie stores with in The Bible that I see people really seeing and feeling these moments a life of a cruelty of punishment of a humanity unfortunately it's been how would I say this they're taking advantage of in terms of power and using it as a method of I've controlled people and I feel like that is the most Elegant and real example of how story can really absolutely enairly be powerful I don't think my goal is to update The Bible my goal is to prove it adjournment my goal is to create an understanding of the world to my perspective through stories of humanity And in a way tcan build the people back together that can build America just as the Old Testament or tower of the tour has built a people a story together I feel like I'd love to make one for her not just the American people but those that are on the periphery Those that are on the outside those are feel that they should belong but they doi'm not saying that people are entirely always in this area of uh uh uh non belonging of loneliness and australization of alienation of complete and utter hopelessness but I believe there are times that we do feel this way as individuals and maybe as groups of people The grand goal of what I plan to do is not necessarily to touch everyone of these people but to live up to my own expectations in myself it seems that every time I learn something new I raise the bar of what is possible and at times II feel that I am my own destruction and that every single day that I lay in my bed and I feel that I am not You're isn't why wake up why when I can just listen to but I couldn't just listen to a sigh and waste later do what I wish I could and then there are times where I believe that I am just fucking divinely touwhere I'm the only one that can do this To where I must count God I feel like lost art but this perfect aid and some it's how do you fight to save up people that hate you I thought that I feel that people hate me and succeed people won't understand they don't understand I don't know think what I do is even comprehensible are you such a lonely ass to walk

- # An Introduction to Literature Criticism and Theory Summarized by AI
	- ## Chapter I The Beginnings
		- The question of when a literary text begins is complex and raises fundamental problems in literary criticism and theory. It can begin with the author's first mark on paper or the reader picking up the book. John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost begins with a thematic and self-referential exploration of beginnings, which echoes and alludes to various other openings. Another way to begin is in medias res, in the middle, as seen in Dante's opening to The Divine Comedy.
		- Dante's opening to The Divine Comedy presents the uncanny terror of beginning in the middle, suggesting that there are no absolute beginnings, only strange originary middles. The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman by Laurence Sterne explores the comic version of the paradox of the beginning already having begun. Beginnings always have a context and determine what comes after, acting like promises for what is to come.
		- The opening sentences of novels, such as Pride and Prejudice, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Moby-Dick, Orlando, The Good Soldier, and Remembrance of Things Past, each present multiple beginnings that introduce the novel's theme, tone, or style. These openings may include peritexts, dedications, prefaces, and contents pages, complicating the idea of a single beginning. Each sentence is crafted to capture the reader's attention, introduce the novel's central idea, and set the tone for what is to come.
		- The deployment of peritexts, such as titles, subtitles, dedications, epigraphs, introductions, and notices, creates multiple beginnings for a literary text. T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922) is an example of how peritexts can complicate the idea of a single beginning. The title of the poem refers to a place or predicament while also forming part of the poem. The Latin and Greek epigraph, tribute in Italian to Ezra Pound, and subtitle are all examples of peritexts that are both inside and outside of the poem. Even the first words of the poem, "April is the cruellest month," can be seen as a beginning that is already burdened with the weight of the peritexts that precede it.
		- Literary texts are constructed by and within a context or tradition, and intertextuality is fundamental to literature. The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot displaces its own beginning through intertextual references, which exemplifies the displacement of origins to other texts that is common in literature. Two common myths about literary texts are the intentional fallacy, which assumes that the author's intended meaning is the real meaning, and the priority given to an individual reader's first reading. However, the act of rereading contests the idea of a single or first reading and suggests that there is no first reading, but rather a "new tissue of past citations."
		- The book explores questions of origins and how to begin reading, thinking about, and writing about literary texts. The author, the reader, and the text cannot be taken for granted as definitive beginnings, as there are uncertain origins. The idea that everything begins with the author, reader, or one particular text is both compelling and false.

- 7 Books that define the infoanomaly which is the leechseed
- CODE - Is the basis of all narrative. It is split into two books
	- CODE THEORY (32 Elements of Literature) - Code Theory is the law of narrative based on "An Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory by Andrew Bennet"
		- Literature is broken down into 32 nuanced concepts.
		- All are written from a neutral balanced perspective.
	- CODE DESIGN PATTERNS - Code Design Patterns are models that help bridge theory and practice together
		- Each pattern is written as a book, represented by a **Name**.
		- Each pattern is placed under one of the 32 code concepts.
	- CODE PRACTICE - Code Practice is a methodology of how to write.
