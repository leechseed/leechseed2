	- Meaning of Fata Morgana
		- "Fata Morgana" is not a synonym for "illusion." It is actually a complex optical phenomenon that creates a mirage. The term "Fata Morgana" comes from Italian and is derived from the name Morgan le Fay, a sorceress from Arthurian legend. Fata Morgana refers specifically to a type of mirage in which distant objects appear to be floating or distorted, often with multiple inverted images stacked on top of one another. It is caused by the bending of light rays due to atmospheric conditions, such as variations in temperature and density.
