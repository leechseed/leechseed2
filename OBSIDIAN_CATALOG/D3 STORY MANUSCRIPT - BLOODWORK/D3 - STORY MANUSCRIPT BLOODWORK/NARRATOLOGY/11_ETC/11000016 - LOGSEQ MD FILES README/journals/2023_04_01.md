- # BISAC to organize books
	- BISAC (Book Industry Standards and Communications) codes are a set of standardized codes that are used to categorize books based on their subject matter. The codes were developed by the Book Industry Study Group (BISG), which is a trade association that represents the book publishing industry in the United States.
	- BISAC codes are organized hierarchically into different levels, with the top level representing the broadest categories of subject matter, and the lower levels representing more specific subcategories. For example, the top-level code "Fiction" includes subcategories such as "Mystery & Detective," "Romance," and "Science Fiction."
	- Publishers typically assign BISAC codes to their books during the publishing process. The codes are used by retailers and distributors to help customers find books that match their interests. For example, if a customer is interested in reading a mystery novel, they can search for books in the "Mystery & Detective" subcategory, rather than having to browse through all of the books in the broader "Fiction" category.
	- BISAC codes are used not only in the United States but also internationally, as they are recognized and used by the book publishing industry around the world. This helps to standardize book categorization across different regions and languages.
	- Overall, BISAC codes are a valuable tool for publishers, retailers, and customers alike, as they make it easier to organize and find books based on subject matter.
