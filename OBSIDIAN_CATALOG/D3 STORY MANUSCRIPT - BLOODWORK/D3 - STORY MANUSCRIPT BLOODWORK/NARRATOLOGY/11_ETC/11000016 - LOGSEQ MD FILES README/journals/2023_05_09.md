- So I'm taking these nuts what I've done is I've decided to retake all over exit out I probably already said that before but truly the goal here right somehow consulted on the theme of consolidation again I've consolidated a lot of the information that I'll create specifically to a story that necessarily doesn't necessarily have a beginning or an end what it does is develop the world and the um The entire IPI guess you would say uh I've taken division two's organizational or a method of method of taking a lot of these narrative elements and organizing them in a certain way what's interesting about the way division 2 does it is that it's not like a Kodak's from mass effect one what it is is that type A narrative elements in terms of I'm sorry but the metaphors and meaning wise like objects or journalso dashi's created by an organization within the world itself and that's what I kind of find very interesting and I think it will actually make it interesting for me and creating it and I don't something that I really enjoy with it I'm putting that into a bit late Out of Bentley what AI forgot the website's called but it's basically a repository for knowledge books and I'm using that disorder have all the information one of the interesting aspects that I really kind of discovered when creating this you're gonna walk out here was that it removes the conception of beginning and ending which I think is a really interesting development I also think it's a very important 1 because when you remove that constraint you're then free to discreet the world itself without the idea or the need to I mean you can't still operate within the concept of the beginning and end of your real story that you're trying to tell but it also is free for those who struggle with creating something that is more than just a story and I believe that's what a lot of literature is able to do is edit it expands beyond just a simple you know surface story and dozen of the subtexts and multiple readings of a book to find real meaning within and it's interesting to sort of compare that sort of insight with video gaming and playing a video game more than once And sort of to relieve that experience again but with more than a different perspective than a different light and this idea of multiple readings kind of reminds me of people who play video games more than once it's kind of rudimenter and kind of spits on the whole I have retired aspect of literature but I mean it's the same type of conchapter to experience something again from a different perspective is something that could be accomplished in a video game and that could also be accomplished well in a literature book On top of that I believe that really studying beginnings is really interesting I really got a lock that in I've also adjusted a bit of the beginning beginning the ivory tower journal decided you can sell a nest underneath so that every towel journalist is the average outdoor journal and issue one will be about Beginnings and then someone and so fi think what I'm gonna do is I feel like I've finished part twof this going through this guy's introductory thanks I'm thinking we're going to start doing that because it's beginning to really brought enough insight for me with that and I feel like this chapter 2 parts gonna do wonders as well after think what really presents this well is that it allows me to still do my research while also Not having a beginning and end to store I can relate nationash into the development of a story of light overx it out when I want to the character the main story like the main mission the main story the side mission the side stories how they all cut a be not to touch the maintenance stuff dub on top of this I can lay on a timeline in which all this stuff I can take the elements from Each of the dossier thinks it's an impatient amount a timeline what that I'll do to help me show me the development and also I can have overarking time lines to show development of theme and store and all that jazz all these sort of poor elements of course there's one book they are 34 I don't know exactly how much each 1 of those will actually play into it but it's a lot I think what a lot of not yummy is occupied but he told me hes like me but the guy who invented metal gear solid 5 is that like me he can get really wounded when it comes to certain topic to ask becks and just forget that there's a game underneath it all and his scope is almost a little bit too wide and kind of forgets you disorder see The narrow scope that a game should have but then again perhaps that wasn't his intention because you know he is a craft and a master of that and I what do I know and then that's but out these
