- Each year lady continuing my development of continuing devicontinuing my my development of buy AI art stability fusion development I'm kind of at a stagnation point just trying to figure out how things work and I'm way to move forward I've been really hung up on this idea of making and combining a greeting my own model which No no that's just gonna be rough because we have to combine certain models I don't know how the combination is going to be when it comes to creating a person to get an animal depending on what did they call something mechanical and really stressed about that part but something I realized and I think is a good point of insight as a spur it was like referencing that guy's reddit post is that he went through several miles and iterations like you start with one model he'll make it as a base and then he'll move on to the next 1 and so forth I think the only thing that really matters is that the style is Contiguous at the end that they all match up the styles are AHA have a continuity at the end of all these models that I use now I can generate these Laura's or other things using different models however what has to be coherent and so they remain in in cut noody is at the end is that the process just has to be the same That's maybe the generation model isn't the these other checkpoints along the way that I use R right and then what I can do is I'll do some testing God's fucking testing dude I'll do testing of the same here I'll create a dope sheet that says what I'll call it of all the assets it's safe a for even Gallion just tanks missclose all that jazz landscapes are like all that and then I'll run it through I'll keep the seeds which one works best I'll keep the seeds for those and and I don't know who generation 1 works right and I'm asking to do isn't this I'm not combined in Bor' maybe just a transformed their style I all that I mean dishes to process I don't know how it's gonna work out but I'll have to figure it out but that's just a general ideology to learn in paintit's like the really big next step is to fucking how that shit works I think it's really fucking easy to learn actually I just didn't learn it I have everything ready I don't know why I haven't been doing it I can go ahead and use let's actually let's go ahead and just make a model that already use the infanting model and then cross reference said 2 rev which doesn't have an inpainting model and then inpaint it again see what happens an artist uses a boiler plate prompt from whatever the ones that I like and the civic day I link Aside from that I really do I think that's on an inside out level Derrick can be used as a starting point to develop the IP as a tabletop RPG universe including over exit out including the future of my 6 stuff that I have in mind and the idea is just not to worry about the continuity don't worry about the framing remember don't worry about the framing framing Frank is afraid hes useless without a paint I haven't been doing any painting today just testing just for a minute and I think that's why I feel like shit aside from that progress has been flooded today but overall I feel like I've made a lot of progress or the last week or 2 just learning AI my python experience really helped GPT still has been one of the strongest tools I've been using What's interesting I think this whole idea of Remy and painting it's all about balance right because you can't really paint without sore data and a lot of source data is just collected right and that's a lot about what framing is getting all the data that you need to look at to frame about styles and all that jazz but I think I should worry about techniques before I worried about styles and I think styles all sides would be a part of Laura training right there's another technique I learned what it was called but it really helped a composition and I wrote it I will solve that Portion of overly working on composition and depth there's a lot of parts of inpainting that I think I need to really hold it on like any of depths that's training that's what I think about it normally how much else to talk about

	- Create multiple images using these settings [Prompt](https://pastebin.com/nE1vmL1h)
	- -
	- Using controlnet for pose
	- -
	- Latent couple for composition
	- -
	- Send best image to inpaint and use controlnet depth + controlnet inpaint model to fix hands (used depth to get the first form of the hand , then proceeded to use regular inpaint)
	- -
	- Inpaint small details like feet with low denoise strength
	- -
	- Inpaint face with multiple batches then select the best result
	- -
	- The new hand didn't felt part of the body , so I ran multiple inpaint passes with low denoise and just hand as a prompt till it fit
	- -
	- Used inpaint sketch using similar colors of the book
	- -
	- Inpaint with latent noise over the book to remove the extra
	- -
	- run a few passes of low denoise img2img to add some details
	- -
	- Upscale using controlnet tiles + ultimate sd upscale + 4x ultra sharp
	- -
	- Normal upscale using ultra sharp
