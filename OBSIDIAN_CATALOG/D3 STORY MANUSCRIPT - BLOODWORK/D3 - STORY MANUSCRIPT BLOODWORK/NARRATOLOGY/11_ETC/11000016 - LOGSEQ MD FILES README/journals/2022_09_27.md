- Let's see 12 what is up snackers so I finished sex and sexuality as part of the Bloom thing I really liked a lot of the themes that was presented in it especially the idea that each individual has both a male and feminine brain with a binary and a lot of that can explain can you expand on characters that I create and how the binary is not necessarily I have to abide by you know what is typically feminine or typically masculine I mean I can but that's more or less for the sake of the society that they exist in not necessarily my interpretation my interpretation will be more or less at these people or blank slates not that they represent certain thematic elements that I'll choose when I'm picking the topos and the topa and all that she has I know that jazz I feel a little anxious I don't know why I'm literally fighting against my biology here oh I need to get stuff done rather than I need to study more It's really hard but I know if I continue to do it at all I'm doing the right thing I think I'm officially halfway at 7 at 7 and what's the finish next one I'll be over halfway I'll be 8 at 7 I really would think what's really cool is that I'm waiting through 2nd sexuality really can validate kind of what I'm trying to do with the MX86 and how sexuality can be the center of a A film without being being considered grotesque I might want it to at some point because sex is grotesque I feel like what I might need to do is just focus on honesty instead of letting fear drive my decision making when creating something I really need to focus on honest what is honest for me from my perspective I guess and I think I need to stop sort of trying to analyze myself before I do these sort of things because If I try and do that then I might become pandering when I write my script whenever I write my movie or whatever ever while thematically characters can represent certain perspectives I think structure wise You can structure relief in the plot put these perspectives on the topos on the theme and put them to dilemmas that incorporate both perspectives are different than I'm as a society's perspective but not really have them come to a conclusion for that and pay for those consequences of their decisions I think I'm not going to do another theme today I really do think I should actually Billy maybe go into literature and kind of getting over arking a conceptualization of that you know that or go to film it's just a difficult deal it's just if I choose literature I'm choosing a different fi'm because path than if I choose film I'm just sticking to that path but if I choose literature it's a whole another path like I'll get I'll move higher in that sort of Plain or sort of a subject and those type of people but tbut then I would select a rebuild myself when it comes to film so what do I do here I have a lot of stuff already built up and film film but the climbing of the film is a lot more more till I let you know bull it feels like it's a lot more scrappy scrappy what won't risk of course I could do the split the different on both and I could just pursue writing for film I can write for film and just pursue writing aspect of I didn't ask Becca if that could be my entrance that way I kind of avoid literature. I could just move to film studies I think that's what I'll do I'll do literature seems a little too far off to what I really want in the end I definitely think it's something I can pursue but after I do feel like it's going to be easy once I get no prolific and film The next thing I'm going to do I think I'm going to download a bunch of books on film theory I think I already have actually maybe I'll pursue that next
