- Zakuzoku  slumps in his throne. An eternity of ambivilence hangs morose in the air.
- Or is that dust.
- Zakuzoku is the size of Ohio. His throne weighted by his epic ass, once the peak of Rushmore now lost in a pile of the unreal godish idea of fast food wrappings.
- He has the jungle matte green chassis of a zaku from Gundam Wing
- The arms of Shinji Ikari's Eva Unit-01 and the legs of metal gear.
- A traditional headband slumps over his cycloptic red fractal eye of a fly
- how does he see thru it? Does he even see?
- To communicate with zakuzoku is to  fathom indifference.
- Great power reeks of such presentation
- Dormant, A Doormat. Zakuzoku the Doormat
- The Kit-Bash God of Peak Creative Content
- Depth not in the means, but in the abundance of reference.
- If he does communicate it will only manifest thru insight of positive bias.
- He got up to take a space piss. Must mean he heard my prayers.
- Sooner than later your answer is the pollen on your skipper's cold air intake debris shield.
- The micro-spermetic clumping of pollen no doubt is causing the jalopy-esque backfiring every time you hit the clutch.
- 'Maybe I work too much. Maybe I got the wrong idea'
- 'Is peak efficiency really the metric of personal fulfilment?'

- Are at which seat 50 one's actually gonna matter a month is it actually still recording party yeah it's actually been about a month since I've shown comment it or did one of these radiolera journals would have done in the meantime is actually really good into destiny and sort of understand how complex modeling works also found out a really good duality which is a passionate and shame a lot of other notes dualities exist like can be existent in any sort of context however what matters is that context right how that dull how do you define that the wildly word exist within the limitations that you put for itself that's how the depth can be Built-in any sort of Artist any form of creativity is discovering that duality and illustrating the depth and the duality and within the context of defining that yeah I've started to like sort of figure out the right system of figuring out a according to a figuring out the system of recording useful notes from the past because there are some and you know that's not something I need to that I've begun to reckon with I used to have another sort of perspective of that you know if my conscience is that robust That I can just come up with another solution but often tiyes efficiency will come and apply because and I'll add another thing is that another duality's efficiency of equality and a thing is like efficiency control quality when the quality already exists right the quality is already there and quality can be improved upon have more quality than I'm just being having to sort of come up with a solution on the spot and that's something that's often difficult at least for me Is having a problem needing to be able to have it solved especially if it's a complex solution within complex seems to but if I already have that's sort of how it mapped out and that's sort of the best way to sort of describe what I'm trying to do here at least that's not been done and the past is to be able to take these notes and then creatively create this network of complex ideas within the same narrative literature fiction universe so mind right using the applying duality to all these things that I've already created in this duality context sort of She's just fucking Christ I need to go outside but it's taken this duality complex and applying it to these ideas that already have and them more robust and quality right and the quality is sort of it's like the whole concept of normal dendrites and new ideas that have had before it's just like you have this idea but then you're just shaved off out of your mind and then if they almost have no purpose without purpose there is no quality But then building upon that purpose building this neural network where these robust ideas connect to others I think is what's necessary to build upon the pass that already have created and what it allows for me to do is sort of you know call the bad ideas as well the benefits I haven't taken notes for someone you know and to reap when I found up in the past now and create the more robust such an ideas and my whole idea is like databasing principles for one thing and the processes right Understand processes intake process which is taking the notes dumping them into a text file opening them up and no no but plus plus and then transfer them into logs I see that's the sort of universal intake to then feed into a repository that has a backup right and I think this universal intake is good because I like it also it's a speed back loop to where I can take notes I've taken from my journal Freedom in to this these notes right and that I can feedback into the text document and then at each step of sort of programmic switching I'm also refining so each step isn't just AI translate a translation is also a calling or a refining of said data want to be doing one text to lock sec from lock sec then that's the process of What I've done with my research and 2 note taking and literature a literature taken right it is a very tedious process but what makes sort of one deal with TDM is purpose and meaningful meaningful effort within the whole concept of an influent and influential influence into the narrative mind like that's what I'll call it What did they call it destiny 2 they called it a throne world surely fucking cool skateboard minescape world mindscape a mind world what's going on in throne world and the destiny 2 universe is at its contextuality within the rest of it's that it's in the middle of the spectrum of throne mode is actually Mars Mars is in the Solar System the Solar System is in space And then there's different dimensions of reality and then there's it's very interesting how it fits within the Granny universe like the throne world is not just the maximal sort of concept and like I feel like that's a whole thing when it comes to sort of generating security increase of data it's that it's always about not the greatest and the biggest and the smallest forms of categorizing data it's a contextuality of these gradients of size and of the data that's sort of what this sort of goal should be used to provide context not necessarily a hierarchy I'm there's a hierarchy but it's more than that it's several things and that's what makes depth and a lot of I think robust narrative projects and that's sort of what I think I should focus on through next because I just have a very good general understanding and my own conceptual theories when it comes to designing narrative now it's just incorporating it into sort of game logic and magic systems and engineering disorder I do not bit more realism into it which I think helped playing so much Des taken this month help with it's they had an idea and they brought it to fruition and a reality that's so fucking super real and awesome That is a goal and that's it for this dictation basically

- Delete seed 52 I think one thing to empower the Mania things is definitely sure though is having AI don't want to see a to-do list because the to-do list is really group 1 of the steps and tackling very mostly do know i feel now which is complex tackling complex goal systems and Objectives and I think that's perhaps were the pinnacle of would say the minds of my generation are going right now and maybe the next ones will capitalize on vocabulary is is how does an individual tackle the complexities of modern life because since so many things are being automated so many things are being catered to us happiness has evolved to much more of a nuanced concept then the past technology has put us there When we are confronted with this onslaught of perceived joy and happiness on the surface level the answer it we need to drill down into the complexity of it with not one situation but multiple and I think that's where a lot of previous formal assumed filmmaking and scripts fails to realize The reason people don't go to amuse movies anymore is because the topics that they follow are ones that have already been tackled to not just be present they need to be future and I don't like I'm a legislator not even this being a previousuccessful you know you need to be able to write a movie that comes out next year and you gotta let me know what they're talking about the thing is who's thinking generally there there are when we belong to Movements and sort of errors of imagination the solutions and the problems are yes one again repeat themselves because human behavior is so tied to its culture that happens again 12 it's more relevant to tackle concepts rather than delicious steak Dick I'd like a tight look so that the duality of culture and Mind the culture would be forever training and part of its evolution is that it's rapidly innovative I wouldn't say evolving because there are memes from the past that research again right so the whole idea is that our culture may be moving slower as a safe guas a Zeitgeist we may have the perception that it's rapidly evolving every single 2nd the way how memes go but know it's basically a normal network that sort of decides what's going on what's good for a time and what's not for a time and it's a sort of A classification of a method of rapid dormant mistake evolution of culture it's prevalent now more than anything is online altar rather than culture of the real world I mean that's almost superseded it because without lying culture there's a the subtext there's still a subtext very much so but it's still a lot of what makes But with the slow evolution of subtext I believe the generation of ours and blow us and is more so than before have a very good grasp on the idea of wh and subtextual humor and so the very consciousness of what the form of what they're watching and how to manipulate that form like TikTok and how to and since their participating within the creation of this media they're hyper aware of it and the meta and how it evolved and what makes goodness and it's what's interesting about I don't want to group every single individual To be part of TikTok but these individuals at TikTok there especially the ones that createmore so concerned with being accepted and on top of that after that capitalizing on that acceptance then on top of that you know that's when you modify the whole idea behind it I mean very materialistic but the whole idea behind that is that we don't get much exposure and say the movies I see sketches to these little bits of media in which they really know about and feel a part of And I think that's what makes TikTok so ground breaking and just that I feel like I need to look up studies on what people do on the ideas of like how people are not what advertisers are looking to do but what people who want to move the medium forward and unfortunately the biggest thing would TikTok is that it's already rooted in the money making machine but I guess you could say that for every form of mass media right She's just a smart of flies considering that I another thing that's reserved is video games so both of which I want to dial that dial had on video games however I need to sort of try and grasp what exactly I want to do in that space a popular smaller VR Like VR storytelling how does that work when it comes to video games wasn't what a lot of with video games is you're able to restrict well I guess you can't distribute I mean it's half life Alex does it was wondering if I was games pushing the medium forward a lot of it is obsessed with being you being in Ask yourself would you mind and your body and this other world and I think with what normal video games do is actually kind of separated that it's kind of removed the mind from the corporeal body especially when it comes to not 1st person games like RTS games not however perhaps if anything these FES are some of the most popular because then you get to somebody elsomeone else it to be someone else and I think that's why leave legends is a lot more about Bean these being someone else and you're consistently reminded that you're playing someone else and that someone else is so hyper real that they I'm almost fine with these types of there early I think that's why league has a lot more personality than valiant but it's a valiant you are occupying these characters one or another and the U more or less armed Focused on their abilities rather than who they are as a person I think it's why other games like this destiny is focuses more on the customization of the chi'm there you go don't get to see them yourself except with a guess and social areas where it matters or when you're doing something incredible it's really interesting to think about I really like bungie if you approach them from a research standpoint they have a lot of the soft but they are implementing that is new and thank God you're on top of their ship business wise Regardless I don't think I wanted to point out the reason I'm so persistent talking today is because I think I hit another bottom point where I just realized I wasn't doing anything and I was being so close then to realize that a lot of my behavior before him was restricted by the idea of shand I also realized I overly focused on how I felt to when I Had to push myself to do something I almost physically recoil like I was I would already feel like physical pain which I'm fucking pissed me off but then she's laying down like a log she always makes you happy anyway I think I do not need to be bombed out of these temporal shameful feelings if anything I need to learn how to empower empower my manic Mania Cause that is what makes me powerful and that's what makes me feel good and that's what makes me what would I do being who I am choosing to do what to go against and not to be the contra to something else the reason I do so much work in this because I decided to and I'm gonna do it I wouldn't do it the best way that I know but no one else affect that once I made that decisiand I need to follow through with it No matter how hard it gets I need to go and I need to do it because my word is probably the biggest tdidn't say that I value now the more than anythi'm gonna be working 12 hours starting at 9:11 and more whatever it takes to get that list done I hope we get at Sarah line going out
