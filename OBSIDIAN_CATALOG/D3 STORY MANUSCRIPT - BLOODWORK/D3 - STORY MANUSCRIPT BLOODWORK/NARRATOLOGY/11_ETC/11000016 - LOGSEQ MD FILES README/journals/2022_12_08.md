- OK as is leech C32I just finished doing the reading comprehension book finished it in about 2 days it was really fast as if we do in the new highlighting method I'm not too sure I'm just moving the book when it comes to comprehension and understanding it but we'll see the next step is just basically do the writing part of instead of a I'm going to be taking the highlights that I've taken and then typing those out instead of you know the hot like directly typing it from the book itself I see at this point I think what I can do is actually know I think I'll split it up like I'll start starting 1st thing that is All Star the things that I think are important then after that is when I will type down stuff there's a lot of really important information and good information in this book 3 things that I believe that I would wantever they take from this tour number one is to be Ah fucking It starts with an ass a superior reader something like that AA smart reaccording to the rope thing and how do I identify my audience basically I'm going to create a framework in which I'm able to take whatever from the IB 9th grade I'm at the I BSL or HL greeting thing is when I'm using the model of reading comprehension break the IB literature thing down into those 5 components and use that to sort of frame how I'm going to write Basically and to that sort of reading comprehension aspect I don't know exactly how to apply that specifically but that's just the idea right now I think we're gonna start and stick with this for a while I think it's really good like like set of information I really need to just roll down upon um I really like a lot of the models but they use especially when it comes to words until capular understanding it and really breaking it down to contacts and all that shit that stuff is amazing What I can do with these is just really understand what each word means and each one of these words I don't think are important I can use to these then words apply to other books that are reading and identify these words that are very important and apply the syntax and other global whether words have she uses to the rest of it I'm gonna be here for a while I think that's fine the 1st thing I need to do is just Just take it all down get out of them and get out of kindle when I get out of kindle like and then start to break down those big 5 steps and then kind of worked them all together I'm gonna apply to the books I've already read restart and that's really it
