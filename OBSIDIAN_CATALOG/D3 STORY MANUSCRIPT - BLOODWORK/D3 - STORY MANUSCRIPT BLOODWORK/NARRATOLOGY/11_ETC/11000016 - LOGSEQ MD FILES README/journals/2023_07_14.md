- # Multimedia Forms
	- **Multimedia Form** - a multimedia form consists of a 'media form' + 'major media form' + 'minor media form'
	- *Purpose*- a multimedia form illustrates an atomized form a creative work. When creating patterns it is important to define their intertextual origin according to their associated multimedia form. This practice assists in the analysis of creative data, the depth of that data, and ultimately empowers the user to create higher level patterns that exist within a single multimedia form as well as hypermediated intertextual patterns.

- # Scaling Media Patterns
	- **Scaling Media Patterns** -  scaling media patterns is the concept that patterns can be applied at every level of the media form higherarchy.
	- *Purpose* - scaling media patterns provides the ability for the user to create patterns that align at a higher conceptual level as well as an atomized specific media form. This practice is fully realized during the querying and data analysis procedure. This practice empowers the user to create patterns that are expressed deeply within the multimedia form concept, as well as a method of connecting hypermediated intertextual patterns between grand media forms
	- Scaling media patterns embodies the principle that patterns can be effectively integrated at every tier of the media form hierarchy.
