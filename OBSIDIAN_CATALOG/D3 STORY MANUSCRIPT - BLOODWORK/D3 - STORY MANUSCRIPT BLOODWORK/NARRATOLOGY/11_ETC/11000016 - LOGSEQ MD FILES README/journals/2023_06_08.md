- # ' if you eat shit for a living, make sure to wipe your mouth'
- # everspace 2 patterns
	- **credits symbol is the 'cents' symbol**
	- **freedom of movement**
		- there are rockets placed for every movement
		- to move faster there is a universal 'boost' movement
	- **to haul cargo, just press F, nothing complicated**
	- visual aesthetic
		- the art style for characters is hand drawn concept like
		- the cutscenes and story is comic book like
		- the game is AAA gameplay like
		- conclusion: saving money while also leaning into constraints
	- **mining gameplay**
		- consists of just shooting the rocks that are non-regenerative
		- conclusion: ez and tactile rewarding
		- the audio reminds me of 'gambling game'  feedback. very rewarding.
		- **rigged asteroids**
			- asteroids that are rigged with TNT
			- each TNT bomb is placed on specific spots on the asteroid
			- you must activate all tnt's within the alloted time to activate an explosion rewarding the minmerals found within the asteroid
	- **open world and story based gameplay**
		- highlights next step for story unintrusively
		- nudges exploratory gameplay with UI bound grey checkpoints associated with loot
		- rewards exploration while also prioritizing story
	- I wish there was a tiny diffference colorwise that in the open world UI resources.
		- Its frustrating when I have to read the difference between a power core and a power core socket.
	- **Weapon design**
		- socket 1 - kinetic
			- good against armor
		- socket 2 - energy
			- good against shield
		- socket 3 - homing rockets
			- tracks locked targets
			- fire and forget
			- 'special'
			- used when multiple enemies CC
		- socket 4 - special
			- Damage over time rockets

	- **socket balancing**
		- usually up to 25-30s from install to ability to use

	- Ship Design
		- Stat Sticks
			- Equipment 1 - Energy Core
				- provides rechargable energy for ship weapons, shields and thrusters
			- Equipment 2 - Shield Core
				- Rechargable, protects against kinetic damage
			- Equipment 3 - Plating
				- protects against energy damage
			- Equipment 4 - Sensor
				- Eyes and ears of a spacecraft
			- Equipment 5 - Recharge Booster

		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686458503588_0.png)
		- Stat Abilities
			- Consumable 1 - Damage limiter
	- **outlaw base combat**
		- what would be interesting kinetic reward would be to
			- have a base finisher, open up the hangars and destroy all the ships that try to fly out
			- shoot the power core inside, and watch the whole place blow
	- **exploratory micro-puzzle gameplay**
		- find the energy, find the socket, insert energy into socket, opens a room with two loot containers
		- the loot containers always are rewarding, usually provides a weapon or equipment of equal or greater value
	- **unexplored system exploration loop**
		- when encountering a system there is a hub and spoke style node system
		- a central node that contains the focus of interest
		- and several surrounding nodes that are fuzzy associated with that central node of interest
		- together, they use proximity as a method of gameplay and story development
		- useful for understanding how **proximity** can be used to fuzzily associate unlike things, nudge, and reward players for experimenting and creativity
	- **hardened mining laser puzzle**
		- I had to use a mirror to mine a 'hardened deposit' of a resource
		- displays emergent, engaging and rewarding gameplay
		- the puzzle was simple enough
		- the pieces were placed strategically together
		- blended in with unexplored system exploration loop
	- **simple trading economy**
		- selling
			- green = high demand
			- red = low demand
		- purchasing
			- green = low demand
			- red = high demand
	- **tractor beam visuals**
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686293305966_0.png)
		- I've seen this pattern before....this visual pattern it.....it does something with space and gravity.
		- I like it
	- **docking story development pattern**
		- whenever you dock somewhere for the first time, or multiple times, there is one character associated with that docking point
		- each docking point and character provides a little bit of information about the world from the perspective of the person who talks to you
- ## Destiny 2 patterns
	- F1 - is default for inventory instead of I
		- conclusion: its so much more convenient
		- alternatives: for tenkeyless users, FN+ESC can be utilized
		- TAB is also used in Everspace 2
