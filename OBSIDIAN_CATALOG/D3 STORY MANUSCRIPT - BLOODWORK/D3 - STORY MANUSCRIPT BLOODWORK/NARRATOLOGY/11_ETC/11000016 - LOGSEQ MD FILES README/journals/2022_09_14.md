	- OK let's eat research log number 4 this is more the priming the priming recording saying that I have not yet started working but I need to really pride myself after taking a break for 2 days just to really get myself back into the E groove do the equivalent I just mean I just listened to my last research log I'm sort of just trying to wrap my head around everything just to review we we really went in depth went in to end up with what theme is so we went from topos theme controlling idea and then further on that and what what you have those 3 things You can really actually break down a really good let's but let's say say pitch right because the pitch is all about the theme it's all about like whoever you're telling the pitch do it's really just hitting them right in the heart is only mind what the story is about is really wanting them to pay attention to it and I'm thinking it's important but anyway but anyway I think the next step will be that will be to going off what I've said before is I want to go through all Jesus go through all Jesus I think there are like 17 different types of of global themes and topos was called topos and what I want to do is I just really need to understand what each one of those are not just like very layman's understanding but are really in depth understanding because once I understand each 1 of those scenes I know the global Understand that I can pick a story and I can identify the theme from one of those 18 or however many they are and once I can do that I can then do the easy part which is a controlling idea which is or the theme the tobos to the theme is a it's a author's interpretation of the topos and the controlling idea right so much I do those it's pretty easy I don't really have to I feel like I don't really need to break down another 1 of there are 1 of those film reviews it just took waiting long and I really think I was able to take what I did And I can I can replicate it if I really wanted to but I think I can move forward after I do that I do that for the guts are primary thing I really need to focus on today is just getting all those themes set out what's up than that I thoui think I'll go to back to save the cat and see what he does next I think what he does next is he takexcuse me pular does and really to start to dig in deep with what he believes is that and I think I should go instead of save the cat TV version I think I'll go to the movie version I think movies are just a lot more simpler than TV shows for right now and that's what I'll do after that after that do and then proceeding proceeding that all probably don't think the next step would be to take the theme and then the toposa thing and kind of Maybe understand how the theme really connects with structure and plot structure and think what I can do there is I can take tropes which are R theme plus structure plus I mean that's pretty much steam and structure and it's very relative to mythology And the sense that it's universal stuff that goes through a lot of what present Lee is watched TV troops.com they have a big list of them maybe do 5 or 6 per it may be several I don't know 20 always seems like a really good answer 20 is a lot though our 20th probably enough to dest sort of demonstrate understanding though some people says it's too much and it's probably just enough to really know what you're talking about but yeah

	- OK so it's a real number 4 week seed research recording log search recording log so so right now the idea is yes what I've done so far and is I've been able to go through a little bit of what whatever his name is sort of idea conceptualization of what the image applied his concept of what the email is to sort of what I done with polar and Also with WhatsApp fucking save the cat says about theme and I'm really starting to really solidify this a little high the theory that the theme is not just a controlling idea but it literally drives the decision making of every other aspect and film the narrative I'm a narrative from that like I really like I can remember a fucking name Bloom and the idea what a topo's theme theme controlling can idea what those are Tobos is what demon is it's a real it's a subject that the Bloom says it's just a thing controlling idea dear or no tobos and then there's actual theme so Western interpretation of theme is that what is the artist interpretation of topos and like sex is bad basically right and then so after that the controlling idea is sex is bad because Edit women's lives something like that and then after that would be to construct why why anyway I already went all over that in the text in the log set lock sec I Hi what I need to do now is I really think I might be moving a little too fast When it comes to sort of deciding blind Bloom to save the cat a little too fast and what I think I need to do next to just take a step back and go over I don't really need to come over everyone of bloom's books but the way around it would be to go over what I think controlling controlling the topos of fall is and what's I go through topus it's fall that I can run through that system again that system again is want tonce I forgot the topos of fall that I can take it and study use that as a framework to study Bloom And then I can revisit do a the whole thematic pathology I'm trying to err methodology I'm trying to take with having it incorporated everything I need to test it 1st before I keep moving up forward with it I think I'm wanting to move too fast ideally after that would be then to identify identify the themes I believe what blooms run to do with each one of these books is to identify core themes and interpretation of topos and whe of each 1 of these books is an example that's why it's universal Tobos a theme and I think I wanna go through the script again and then add that as another column as another one to sort of see where the theme applies within context of the dramatic structure rupture and plotting of the film yeah and I can see how like what if there are new correlations when it comes to the timing and everything and after that I think I could probably go do another film Or see what insights I have and maybe I can do which are some things but I still think I should avoid trying to make something I'm learning to study a little bit more cause I'm always so quick to create shit but II need to do the one thing that I haven't always done is just to focus on the study perit's on the study. Right
