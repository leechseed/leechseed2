- # what the fuck. someone already did it. thanks chatgpt
	- ## hashtag struggling to create a unified modeling language for literature
		- hashtag when someone writes a book but under closer scrutiny you realize they're full of shit. there's some nuggets of gold in the Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms but it isn't the Golden Goose dookie spray I expected

		- This has happened several times over the course of research. Adjust my expectations
	- ## is there a domain-specific language for literature?
		- Yes, there are several domain-specific languages (DSLs) that have been developed specifically for literary analysis and interpretation. These DSLs are specialized languages that have been created to help researchers and scholars in the field of literature to more effectively analyze and interpret literary texts.
		    
		  Some examples of DSLs for literature include:  
		- **NarrativeML**: NarrativeML is a markup language that has been developed for representing the structure of narratives in literary works. It allows users to encode narrative structures such as character, plot, and setting, and provides a way to visualize the relationships between these elements.
		- **ThemeRiver**: ThemeRiver is a visual language that has been developed for exploring the themes and patterns in large collections of texts. It uses a river-like metaphor to represent the flow of themes over time, and allows users to analyze the relationships between different themes and how they change over the course of a work.
		- **Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL)**: The Shakespeare Programming Language is a DSL that uses the syntax and vocabulary of Shakespeare's plays to write computer programs. While not specifically designed for literary analysis, SPL is an example of how language can be used in unexpected and creative ways.
		    
		  Overall, these and other DSLs for literature are tools that can help researchers and scholars to analyze and interpret literary texts in new and innovative ways. They offer a way to formalize and structure the complex relationships and patterns found in literary works, and can provide new insights into the meaning and significance of these works.  
	- ## continue research in the UML or LUL (LEECSHEED UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE MODEL)
		- ### explore the DSLs listed above. research, analyze, interpret, you know the deal.
		-
		- ### anyways all this talk about Dick Sucking Lips makes me want to be the fuck out of my own genitals

- Hey yo it's 850 baby I had to pick up my left off the idea of I didn't get another one of these the idea of does not I'm using bartos now that I've gotten I mean like a loud Zack I do not want a force log set into several holes Assembled like to be the one it was that 1 and all solution to the 16th I need to get done like Noah's I feel like it's better to just have it specialized and I'm already I'm already using it for multiple facilities right I'm using it as a journal I'm losing it as a repository for my thoughts I'm using it as a change block I'm using it as a way to take notes from books and to do research and to consolidate ideas no it's to build a But it's called a unifying modeling language which from different sources and what I tried to do was use it as a way to ideate and to create I good God good ideas that relate to complex understandings and that's where it kind of stops working for me because I can't really solve it feels like I'm self reinforcing myself right when I when I feel like I need a new idea I need to have something A different space like something that I'm able to get into the mindset of including things that are not already on the page that are not already in a log set and the in the graph because I don't like the idea of the feeling I'm being consumed by one program I just I suppose I had with Justice do you think I've ever known or just using I'm sitting in it felt more like I got to a point where I believe it felt like I was being Constrained too much because I then began to think more about how am I gonna organize this rather than what is a good idea and it became more of a trouble defining a way to organize and make sure whatever I come up with is accessible in the sense that a lot of what these 2nd mind people of efficiently accessing ideas that you've had but I think what they were they missed the mark here or one thing that they have a criticism of it is that they have more respect for Organizing ideas without the content concept of quality of ideas idea of there's no constraint without constraints the biggest constraint is locksec itself is then you add another constraint of a system that needs to function but eat yet OK Siri the 1st constraint is the tool that you're using and the fact that It's a very complex tool but most people still don't really know how to use yet 2 what you do understand of the tool is using a methodology that other people have decided is the best way to use it a number 3 since you're using somebody else's way of organizing and coming up with an idea it almost reduces your capability for me at least the drift the mission drift of actually being able to log all my shit of all this research and to be able to capture it's not really a tool too ID8 with it's a definitely a capture to capture tool logs like the obs of cre activity boogie it's the OBS and oh my gosh and maybe the inside the 1st pass of Adobe premiere right It's a refiner and it is a repository right God shit would you mean yo yum yum yum and decided yum that's yum why I'm yum using yum mira yum right now yum as yum a way yum to yum yum yum really yum yum yum yum yum be able yum yum to just yum use yum yum yum yum yum yum yum this yum what do you call it a goddamn was it a visual aid or a fucking graphic model that's what it is I'm using a mindmap as a graphic model to ideate come over the ideas now here's a thing what I realized is that that also too is lamentating right so because sometimes ideas don't occur in mind maps why maps are really good whenever you're idioting and you're really trying to take concepts that are You're a are related but I have not found a way to relate that's probably like the best it's probably the best way of using a mind map no what a whiteboard is fucking amazing at doing is developing the depth of understanding overconcept are a theory or a not thing necessarily to map it out of where it fits and the UML but basically Why it's in the UML right it's like like I'm able to create graphic models using the whiteboard but these graphic models are often abstract right it helps me process information mation it's OK so it takes it takes help me visualize and represent information and knowledge that I have processed And came up with an idea that then I can visually represent on board and then further expand on it without having to worry about remembering it and freeze up my uh just got mental space on my way over my working memory right it's interesting because I realize that this UML is going to have more than not just going to be in the field of literary fiction but also in the fields of the process is a research and Psychology and shit right and now it also need to understand that when it comes to mind maps I should not worry about the classification text on me and the continuity of the organization of words that I believe are relevant to communication because that's again doing 2 more things at once it's too complicated and it's goingna dry me down a hole what I need to do is just focus on generating the word or just getting it down what I think of a good idea like when I just thought of that What is it called a working memory I should just write that down on the memo working memory I know when I come with a new idea I should just keep writing those things down and then I get to 2 quartered Allah perhaps then I will make a second I will do the timeline thing where I will move the infinite was canvas to the left to the right as a demonstrate a passage of time and development and show and more how a representative represent a change log of version in to what happens next And that way I can see sort of what I was I'd be able to reasonably recall information of why I did it and visually representing through simply the movement to the right and hopefully if that just would just that it will probably be simple enough but on case if I don't I can even prepare for contingencies by also adding change notes and adding comments and I think that's what's great about it like all that I just thought about it right now and I said that's what I'll do I'll create a cigarette another mirror aboard I think so I think I'll use that other one fook or whatever it's called all you used that because maybe I can just use mirror as a form of consolidating ideas or experimenting ways to organize and classify ideas that have already decided that are robust enough to take the time to Correlated with other units of information into one consolidated whole that other program I think that's when I need to do I need to consider sort of spaces in area represented in the digital world right not necessarily departments but areas and related to the tool that I use not the idea or the purpose the tool center my focus on compartmentalization on the tool rather than the process it's just often that it correlates that the process and the tool may just be associated with 1 and the other robust is of the tool and Right now I'd stop with studying and final right that's also ideal with that but sure this other program maybe doing it this way might work put my phone on silent if it's not then I'm moving they're anyway gone on for too longfind a razor jerk off please

- Lucy for none continued laugh You laugh I'm going to be ready to 28 I guess anyway so what I've done is recently wanted to expand my researchemethodology and development beyond logs i got there and just shut the fuck up running into ideas of idiation and analyzing and interpreting And translating from book to knowledge also chat ABT so basically I mean I had AI mean theoretically adding a bunch here Jack GPT is probably the most helpful tool and I think changes my God damn it's so fucking annoying chat GBT is a tool that I've been able to use I don't really shut down and idioted or just contemplated on why it's good and be willing to say it and I can't and I don't really like When it comes to just turn the idiot blue sky and things there's a lot of Ah let's say information anacknowledge that is you're kind of required modules to possess that I'm but I'm not really right there are units of knowledge that are needed to sort of actually come up with a decent idea right alright alright decent thing RAA Brian and ID anotheight we have an idea that correlates but it's also of the of a quality that is More than just bullshit unfortunately there's AI found out like I couldn't put in the word but there's a lingering disparity of what I need to know of acquiring knowledge that isn't from tier one sources or know from books of where you are you know scarley journals are what not and just basically having a generalized better than slightly more like a thwart heat of God 8AA general understanding of an idea or a concept that is sound and authoritative but brief right I don't like and to be able to validate that type of knowledge other contemporary ways of doing it now just to Google it but going to Google has a source real information that's degraded that this when the idea of gaining the algorithm to place your page 1st not to because The information is sound but because it is optimized for that to appear higher on the list of categov no list of search results they're not created I mean the displaying unless it's not necessarily created to what you want but to what Google thinks if you want from sources that are not interested in what you want but what Google will think you wand without phenomena it's just Become a worse and worse almost completely untrustworthy source of information and the thing is with Wikipedia you almost have to understand the modeling language of what you are looking for to really get at the meat without getting lost in the sauce and having tabs opened up and shit and there's almoit's what Wikipedia it still is done with the forma it that supports a long form very detailed authoritative Solution and answer but for me what I need is just to know exactly like no no I have a general concept of what socialism is but I want to make sure that it is of sound nature like I don't need it to be exactly need right to I be don't an expert on it but I need to know the general consensus of what it faced because it's like it's such as a won't be like a central Nate need to this do thing but it's an answer that I need is inter a small bit of information that they need to get a better answer a bigger answer to it right It's quite a bad example but anyway it's hard to be default that because I'm able to ask it a question and the thing is unlike Google and Wikipedia I can ask clarifying questions and I can it feels like it's listening and understanding and we can both walk down this path together I've getting to what I need to know whether with Google it's the same way that people use SEO and backlinks to display their pages on the front page you as a person are trying to formulate an answer and enter into really adjust your search term is based What's given but the thing is even if you do that you're still giving the same fucking results and they're saying fucking page right and so you have to think more after it becomes a tool of burden and unreliable to hold a burden it's a tool that's supposed to be fulfilled this thing but it's not good enough at doing it so you have to learn a skill set that's almost inefficient to the point where it should probably be outsourced but at this point you're then learning But then it's that's an also it's just when your outdoors do something it's another point of inefficiency it's just a different problem because then you're having to still translate what you need to someone else for them to find what you need using the same shit tools so no I don't really like your almost having double you're doubling your problems anyway so what chapter to be D has been able to do for me is replace Google In the terms of what I need to do to come up with short authoritative definitions things that I can reliably used did to generally come multitude of different ideas that will lead to perhaps the solution that I need and it helps me do that faster more accurately and In a way that doesn't cause me to pull my hair out I think I'll stop here and then start another please
- # I should consider this contest when I enter a production sprint later this year.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1677162835297_0.png)
- ## Nanowrimi or whatever that shit is should be the tentpole event that signals the end of my research phase (for now) and the beginning of a production phase
- ### ^^I need to set a scope for the research.^^
- ### however, to first set a scope for the research, I should ^^set a visualized representation of what exactly what I believe a complete understanding of the field should be and note the date.^^
- # VERSION CONTROL AND UNIVERSAL CONVENTIONS BOK BOK BOK
	- #### the idea of a 'date' should be noted as a 'change log' rather than a 'complete version'
	- #### the change log of documents of **mila** or **miro** should be on the project itself and just be a numbered list of dates
	- #### dates are logged and numbered when the project is accessed.
		- a future system would include comments in the change log but we don wana drift too much
	- #### version numbers should only be used when exporting project into a file format
		- **Version Number** is the corresponding number of the date in the change log
	- formatting the version number should be something like
		- 0.0001.0223.2023
		- 0.0099.0317.2025
		- 0.vvvv.mmdd.yyyy
		- 0.version.monthday.year
		- the first zero simply denotes a file that is for an internal project and should not be used as a reference for any public release.
		- 01.832.0420.2029
		- **01** is noted when a file has achieved **status: canon**. when information within the file has been through the assessment battery and passed.
		- **assessment battery**- the process checklist which, similar to a start-up process to like a fighter jet, ensures that all necessary requirements are present (formatting, spelling), critical dependencies (continuity), and all contingencies are closed (or are approved for launch with noted risk report.
			- EG: when canon status is achieved, the document is officially considered truth/knowledge.
		- **Status: Canon** - A file noted as canon should be held in the highest regard. Truth/knowledge allows the author use the information within and fully engage in the creative process. The file is **trustworthy** therefore the author can operate without the stress or anxiety of quality and continuity, because that shit was already taken care of homie, just continue to develop dat thicc story
