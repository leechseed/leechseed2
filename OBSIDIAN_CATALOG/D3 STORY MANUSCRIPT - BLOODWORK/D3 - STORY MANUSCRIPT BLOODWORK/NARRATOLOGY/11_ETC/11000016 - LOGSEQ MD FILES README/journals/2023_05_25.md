- # Animated Illustration - the wicked key to a wicked problem
	- the bridge between 'real' full animation and illustration
	- its cheaper, an easier skill to learn, and builds upon what I already know in photoshop and after effects
	- These are animated illustrations I would use before in my wallpaper backgrounds when I used to stream. I can use them as a method of inspiration and reference
	- Using this technique saves resources when rendering out images with SD.
	- I can now render up to 4k resolution *per shot in shot list*
	- I can take the time in creating a background image with AI, specific to each *card*
	- *Software*
		- Photoshop
		- Spine Pro - $329
		- After Effects
		- DaVinci Resolve
