	- ### **Frankenstein by Mary Shelley - *Frankenstein: Creation as Catastrophe by Paul Sherwin***
		- *__'In Creation as Catastrophe, Paul Sherwin takes a psychoanalytic approach to Shelley's novel, which the Creature arising from a kind of primal-scene trauma and seeking wholeness.'__*
		- ^^*__'In his relentless pursuit of an impossible desire, the Creature resembles a sublime artwork, one that simultaneously represents and eclipses its creator.'__*^^
		- *'Thus, for Sherwin, the uncanny experience of bringing things back to life-whether they be the repressed trauma of the analysand or the reanimation of the Creature, mirrors the genesis of any sublime artwork.'*
		- *__'Any representation of the creative process, whether the novel's narrative or my analytic account, is bound to distort the experience of the whole self. Suspended between heaven and hell, those absolutely disjoined fictive polarities that are in fact mutually sustaining correlates, the creator at once ravaged and ravaged by sublimity.'__*
		- *__'He is filled and swallowed up, but not entirely full or emptied out; for to be wholly abandoned to the sublime would amount to autism, and there would no longer be a self to experience the uplift or downfall.'__*
		- *__'It is always, to modify Emerson slightly, a case of I and the abyss.'__*
		- *'Since he cannot be the thing itself and cannot be nothing, Frankenstein is a spirit destined to 'exult in the agony of the torturing flames.'*
		- ^^*__'Another name for this giant agony is despair. 'Despair,' writes Kierkegaard, cannot...'__*^^
			-
			  > ***'consume the eternal thing, the self, which is the ground of despair, whose worm dieth not, and whose fire is not quenched. Yet despair is precisely self-consuming, but it is an impotent self-consumption...This is the hot incitement, or the cold fire in despair, the gnawing canker whose movement is constantly inward, deeper and deeper...This precisely is the reason he despairs...because he cannot consume himself, cannot get rid of himself cannot become nothing. This is the potentiated formula for despair, the rising of the fever in the sickness of the self.'*  
				- Seren Kierkegaard**
		- *__'As Kierkegaard would have it, Frankenstein is a prisoner of despair because his volatile spirit desire only to augment itself because the self is not 'grounded transparently in the Power which posited it.'__*
	- ### **God's Grandeur by Gerard Manley Hopkins - *Elements of the Longinian Sublime in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins***
		- *'Longinus associates sublimity with such effects as elevation, grandeur, power, ecstasy, and the ability to provoke irresistible awe.'*
		- *__'Sublimity,' he says 'flashing forth at the right moment scatters everything before it like a thunderbolt, and at once displays the power of the orator in all its plentitude.'__*
		- ^^*__'In this way, sublime writing convinces us of the power of the writer while also enhancing the reader's own sense of power and loftiness.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'The effect of the sublime is to 'dispose the soul to high thoughts' and to 'leave the mind more food for reflexion than the words seem to convey.'__*^^
		- *__'The poet thus manages to sound authoritative without sounding egotistical. He manages to sound ecstatic without sounding self-important or self-absorbed.'__*
		- ^^*__'In his treatise, Longinus makes it abundantly clear that the sublime is not merely a matter of rhetoric and phrasing but a matter of character and morals. A bad man cannot be a sublime poet, and a corrupt, materialistic society is unlikely to produce sublime literature.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'The sublime is a call to personal, social, and spiritual greatness, not simply to elevated but empty rhetoric, and any sublime work of literature is implicitly a critique of lowly, the trivial, and the unworthy.'__*^^
		- *'...the proper time for using metaphors is when the passions roll like a torrent and sweep a multitude of them down their resistless flood.'*
	- ### **The Poetry of Homer and Sappho - *Selection from Longinus's On the Sublime***
		- *'After the Greek text (attributed to Longinus) was translated into French and introduced to a wide readership in the seventeenth century, poets and critics alike began to form sentiments, works of art, and aesthetic theories that lauded and attempted to capture the sublime'*
		- ^^*__'For Longinus, successful writing and speaking do not merely persuade but transport their readers and listeners into a recognition of their creator's greatness, an ecstatic state where the boundary between self and other is overcome by powerful emotion.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'There are, it may be said, five principal sources of elevated language.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Beneath these five varieties there lies, as though it were a common foundation, the gift of discourse which is indispensable.'__*^^
			- *__'First and most important is the power of forming great conceptions, as we have elsewhere explained in our remarks on Xenophon.'__*
			- *__'Secondly, there is vehement and inspired passion.'__*
		- *__'These two components of the sublime are for the most part innate.'__*
		- *__'Those which remain are partly the product of art.'__*
		- *__'The due formation of figures deals with two sorts of figures:__*
			- *__'first those of thought and secondly those of expression.'__*
		- *__'Next there is noble diction, which in turn comprises choice of words, and use of metaphors, and elaboration of language.'__*
		- *__'The fifth cause of elevation-one which is the fitting conclusion of all that have preceded it-is dignified and elevated composition.'__*
		- *__'Sublimity is the echo of a great soul. Hence also a bare idea, by itself and without a spoken word, sometimes excites admiration just because of the greatness of soul implied.'__*
		- ^^*__'One source of the sublime in the systematic selection of the most important elements, and the power of forming, by their mutual combination, what may be called one body.'__*^^
		- *__'The former process attracts the hearer by the choice of the ideas, later by the aggregation of the chosen.'__*

	- ### **The Poetry of John Keats - *The Tragic Sublime of Hazlitt and Keats by W.P. Albrect***
		- ^^*__'W.P. Albrect delineates John Keats's conception and use of the Romantic sublime by first pointing out how Keats diverges from his contemporaries. Albrect argues that Keats's sublime is similar to that of William Hazlitt.'__*^^
		- *__'Albrecht provides a valuable and clear analysis of Romantic sublimity by tracing its similarities with the influential aesthetic theory of German philosopher Immanuel Kant and addressing important psychoanalytical studies of the subject by Thomas Weiskel and Stuart Ende.'__*
		- ^^*__'According to Albrect, Keats rejected many notions commonly held about the sublime: that it is essentially distinct from experiencing beauty, that it is exclusively occasioned by feelings of terror and awe, and that it can only be found in the solitary and meditative contemplation of natural grandeur.'__*^^
		- *__Weiskel's model is Kant. Aesthetic form, according to Kant, must impress the judgement as purposefully disinterested. Thus, judgement links understanding with the transcendental faculty of reason.'__*
		- ^^*__'Beauty engages reason when the mind bases its judgement on the interplay of visible forms. Therefore the imagination must succeed in representing these forms to the understanding.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Sublimity, on the other hand, requires the imagination to fail. Before the mind can call on reason for an intuition of absolute magnitude or power, it must reject, as futile, the imagination's effort to represent these qualities.'__*^^
		- *__'Therefore only by 'subreption'--that is, only by an acknowledged misrepresentation-can a sensible object be allowed to symbolize infinite oneness.'__*
		- *__'In order to sustain the sublime moment, the interplay of mind and object must continue to put down the sensory imagination.'__*
		- *__'The 'displeasure'(Unlust) in the imagination's failure and the 'pleasure'(Lust) in reason's triumph alternately repel and attract the mind.'__*
		- *'Weiskel builds a similar embarrassment into the structure of the Romantic sublime.'*
		- ^^*__'In Wordsworth, however, it is not the imagination's failure to grasp the external object, but the object's failure to represent the mind's ideas, that Weiskel sees as provoking a cognitive crisis. Consequently, sensory particulars must lose their reality in a fog of self-projection.'__*^^
		- *__'In other words, the Romantic sublime can't win. It either sacrifices empirical reality to the noumenal reason, as in Kant, or smothers it with 'overdetermination' as in Wadsworth.'__*
		- *'To furnish a model for the Romantic sublime, Coleridge will serve better than Kant (although Kant supplied Coleridge with some useful parts). Since an object cannot simultaneously keep and lose its 'shape,' says Coleridge, it cannot be both 'sublime and beautiful at the same moment to the same mind'; but a beautiful object, such as a circle becomes sublime when Coleridge 'contemplates eternity under that figure.'*
		- ^^*__'This is the dialectic both beauty and sublimity. Both draw on reason to inform sensory objects with some principle beyond time and space. But whereas a beautiful object does this by displaying separate parts unified within a determinate whole, the sublime dismisses all thought confined by space or time.'__*^^
		-
		  > ***'Sublimity is a quality, bestowed by the mind, which extends the reality of external objects by repudiating the boundaries of time and space in an intuition of endless power or magnitude; this intuition acquires content from the interaction of mind and object as the mind, though the synthesizing power of the imagination, tries to comprehend the infinite through an awareness of the finite.'*  
			- E.H. Coleridge**
		- *'This definition, which applies to the psychological structure of the sublime, allows room for considerable variety of content.'*
		- ^^*__'Now it is 'human and dramatic imagination,' with all its variety and intensity, that accounts for sublimity. Hazlitt's distinction between the ideal and the dramatic describes qualities that set his sublime apart from Kant's, Coleridge's, and Wandsworth's.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'The 'ideal' aspires 'after pure enjoyment and lofty contemplation alone...' In its 'continued approximation to the great and the good,' the mind 'rejects as much as possible not only the petty, the mean, and disagreeable, but also the agony and violence of passion, the force of contrast, and the extravagance of imagination.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'The 'dramatic,' on the other hand, may include all of these and must include the last three.'__*^^
		- *__'It is this intensity in diversity that, according to Hazlitt, unites the tragic and the sublime.'__*
		- ^^*__'Structurally, however, the tragic sublime is still within the definition generalized from Coleridge: in an intuition of endless power or magnitude the temporal and spatial separateness of sensory forms disappears from thought.'__*^^
		- *__'But in the interaction of mind and object Hazlitt has replaced 'reason' with 'reasoning imagination'--that is, with imagination so conditioned by sympathetic experience that it immediately combines selected particulars into 'truth' and 'reality.'__*
		- *__'Since accumulated experience recognizes the persistent reality of evil as well as good, the 'endless allness' intuited by the tragic sublime no longer has beneficent auspices or entirely reassuring effects.'__*
		- *__'Hazlitt's final...statement in this essay, where he argues that tragedy releases a comforting flood of benevolence and simultaneously elevates the audience to a strengthened 'desire of good.'__*
		- *__'But in the second phrase, 'reflections' suggest a tragic 'pleasure' that is both intellectually fuller and more original. As it 'rouses the whole man within us.'__*
		- *__'Tragedy brings the discriminating and organizing force of thought and feeling to bear on evil, and in the mind's power to know evil--both its strength and its limits--the audience finds reassurance.'__*
		- *'...tragic passion overcomes 'separateness'--in images, association, character, or action-to produce an intuition of absolute oneness.'*
		- ^^*__'Thus Hazlitt's tragic sublime conforms to the structure of the Romantic sublime. Its content, although excluding any supernatural interest in the matter, affirms the truth of intense experience as transcending evil and thereby offering reassurance in a tragic world.'__*^^
		- *__'A tragic character...may contribute to this reassurance through some sort of moral triumph over death, but moral triumph on the part of a character is not necessary to the tragic sublime.'__*
		- *__'All that is necessary is that the mind---of the reader or spectator---simultaneously create, test, and accept a version of the truth so firm that, in Keat's words, it is also beautiful. Thus tragedy defamiliarizes familiar pain.'__*
		- *__'It may help clarify the tragic sublime to mention Richard Payne Knight and Shelly.'__*
		- *__'Tragedy is sublime, said Knight, but neither tragedy nor any other work of art has much to do with morality. Knight did not recognize a faculty like Hazlitt's reasoning imagination which can comprehend large designs of thought and feeling.'__*
		- ^^*__'What an audience enjoys is only the vigor and energy of tragic emotions. Knight's amoral sublime leaves the tragic disagreeables outside the theatre; the tragic sublime always puts them on stage.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Shelley's sublime is neither amoral nor always tragic. Sublimity, in Shelley's most general sense, seems to mean loftiness in beauty and virtue.'__*^^
		- *__'The imagination has brought all the mind's resources of thought and feeling into a cognitive surge that raises sensory perception to 'essential Beauty.'__*
		- ^^*__'Keat does not separate the sublime from the beautiful except as 'sublime' may mean the intensity of emotion necessary to beauty.'__*^^
		- *__'Stuart A. Ende sees the sublime as an illusion-not 'morally sinister' as Weiskel calls it, but aesthetically perverse.'__*
		- ^^*__'In Keats and in Yeats,' says Ende, the sometimes indistinguishable ideals' of 'Eternal Being, beauty, and one's idea of the great men who have gone before constitute poetic sublimity, the state of being to which poetic ecstasy may transport the poet.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Keat's professed 'humility' towards these three ideals need not, however, confirm his acceptance either of this definition or of the kind of 'otherness' it implies. This 'otherness,' Ende believes, is beyond the human exigencies of both pleasure and pain.'__*^^
		- *__'Therefore, to avoid the insubstantiality and isolation of merely contemplative poetry, a poet must settle for something less than sublimity.'__*
		- *__'According to Ende, Keats reached his ultimate solution in the 'sublime pathetic,' which, without completely sacrificing the search for others, retains a 'commitment to sorrow.'__*
		- *__'For Keats, the sublime cannot exist apart from empirical reality. It simply heightens this reality into essential beauty, regardless of any unpleasant materials reality may include.'__*
		- ^^*__'The tragic sublime welcomes the disagreeables so that it may evaporate them.'__*^^
		- *__'To look for vision beyond pain, Keats discovered, is to end up loving death; but to embrace even pain in vision, is to find sublimity in life.'__*
		- *__'Although the tragic sublime may make moral judgements, it comprises, in its particular kind of infinite oneness, the moral extremes that make up the world's uneasy balance of good and evil'__*
		- ^^*__'So defined, the tragic sublime has much the same content as Ende's 'sublime pathetic.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'The difference, other than in language, is that the tragic sublime draws its exciting emotions from a wide range of experience, while the 'sublime pathetic' takes its initial impulse from an ideal beyond general experience-an ideal which it must eventually compromise.'__*^^

		  > ***'All art is sensuous, but when a man puts only his contemplative nature and his more vague desires into his art, the sensuous images through whit speaks become broken, fleeting, uncertain, or are chosen for their distance from general experience, and all grows unsubstantial and fantastic.'*  
			- William Butler Yeats**
		- *__'All that makes Keats's sublime--the tragic sublime--remote from suffering is the intensity that firms images of pain into truth and beauty.'__*

	- ### **King Lear by Youknowwho - *Othello; MacBeth; Lear by Edward Dowden***
		- *'Edward Dowden characterizes King Lear as a tragedy in which 'everything is in motion, and the motion is that of a tempest.'*
		- ^^*__'The moral ambiguity of the play's cosmos constitutes, for Dowden, a kind of verisimilitude where 'the mysteries of human life' are rendered both sublime and grotesque.'__*^^
		- *__'Remarking on Cordelia's undeserved fate and Lear's harsh punishment, Dowden asserts that Shakespeare 'does not attempt to answer these questions because the heart is purified not by dogma, but by pity and terror.'__*
		- *__'Thus Dowden concludes that Shakespeare presents readers and audiences of King Lear with a Stoic universe, one where 'human existence is a vast piece of unreason and grotesqueness' that can only be mitigated by an indifferent 'devotion to the moral ideal, the law of the soul, which is forever one with itself and with the highest reason.'__*
		- ^^*__'By authoring a universe filled with 'inexplicable riddles' and capturing our capacity for evil-doing and loving devotion in his characterizations, Shakespeare, according to Dowden, has created a sublime drama whose 'effect cannot be received at second-hand; it cannot be described; it can hardly be suggested.'__*^^
	- #### **Kubla Kahn by Samuel Taylor Coleridge - *The Sublime in Coleridge's Kubla Khan by Robert C. Evans**
		- ^^*__'Coleridge often associated the sublime with astonishingly awe-inspiring natural features-the same sorts of features that appear later in his famous poem.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Coleridge and the Sublimity of Landscape' are frequently reminiscent of the kind of sublime landscapes and natural features depicted in 'Kubla Khan.'__*^^
		- *'Coleridge describes the poet as 'one who carries the simplicity of childhood into the powers of manhood; who, with a soul unsubdued by habit, unshackled by custom, contemplates all things with the freshness and wonder of a child,' particularly with 'the childlike feeling of devout wonder.'*
		- *__'David Vallins begins his book by asserting that 'no other British Romantic focuses so consistently as Coleridge on the importance of transcending the material, the everyday, or the mundanely comprehensible in favor of a confrontation with the infinite forces which, like many of his contemporaries, he sees an underlying both human consciousness and the natural world.'__*
		- *__'Vallins associates Coleridge's views of the sublime with feelings of 'elevation and excitement' and also with ' a liberating sense of calmness and freedom from merely temporal concerns'__*
		- *__'For Coleridge as much as for any Romantic, the feeling of the sublime is the feeling of life itself, intuited through the medium of our own mental activity and striving.'__*
		- ^^*__'In responding to sublime landscapes, Coleridge often emphasizes the 'grandeur, remoteness, wildness, and savagery of mountain regions.'__*^^
		- *'Most readers, however, will also feel an enormous sense of gratitude to a poet capable of writing in such an intensely sublime fashion and capable of communicating, so convincingly, that sense of the sublime to others.'*
	- ### **Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey by William Wordsworth - *A Poem About Interiors by Albert O. Wlecke***
		- ^^*__'For Albert Wlecke, the Wordsworthian sublime deals with the interior world: 'We might say, therefore, that whatever else 'sublime' awareness, or 'sublime' intentionality, is in 'Tintern Abbey,' it seems to involve an act in which consciousness senses itself penetrating an interior.'__*^^
		- *__'Wlecke calls the Wordsworthian sublime a sort of sacred horror in which individual autonomy and notions of self dissolve in a visionary moment: 'To be haunted by a passion is to be haunted by his love, his desire to encounter the visionary underworld of creative power. And he is simultaneously afraid of this love, of staring to directly into the awe-engendering underworld of consciousness--an underworld from which, however, he cannot quite turn his face away in the patent 'deep and gloomy wood' of Tintern Abbey.'__*
		- *__'Thus, for Wlecke, Wordsworth, in depicting the grandeur of nature, explores the sublime depths of consciousness imagining itself.'__*
		- *__'Tintern Abbey is a poem preoccupied with the insides of things, with a sense of immanent power lurking beneath the surface of phenomena. The 'something of course is 'deeply interfused' and dwells within all things.'__*
		- *'Wordsworth's otherworld is thus an underworld, not that created by Miltonic vision but that discovered by consciousness turning inward upon itself. The negative comparisons of these lines curiously suggest that this underworld, while totally devoid of form or shape, is still a space, a 'haunt,' an almost sacred spot filled with the presence of awesome power.'*
		- *'Since in terms of Wordsworth's metaphors, there is nothing to be seen in this haunt--no palpable shape upon which the mind can establish a purchase--reflexive consciousness discovers no limiting contours to its introspective plunge and thus funds itself upon a fearful journey into an open-ended abyss.'*
		- ^^*__'This kind of interior space is quite different from the confining space of Locke's camera obscura. This earlier metaphor for the mind reflects both Locke's rejection of the theory of innate ideas...and his restriction of the sources of knowledge to the not always certain reports of the senses.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Wordsworth's metaphor of the mental abyss, however, intimates a theory of the mind which goes far beyond Locke's careful empiricism. For immanent throughout the poet's interior space is the numinous power of the imagination-sometimes referred to him by a mist or a vapor, sometimes a stream, sometimes as nothing more than the sound made by an unseen stream.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Consciousness allows itself to become aware aware of imagination's power by displacing that power into a shrine in the phenomena supplied by the light of sense.'__*^^
	- ### **The Poetry of Robert Lowell - *Robert Lowell, Emerson, and the American Sublime by Henry Hart***
		- *'Henry Hart examines how Lowell was both influenced and repelled by Boston's 'familiar hometown ghost,' Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the tradition of sublime poetry.'*
		- *'Though influenced by his close associations with modernist and neoclassicist writers who were openly hostile to Emerson's naivete and the 'ravenous free-enterprise capitalism' it allegedly allowed, 'Hart argues that Lowell's 'ambivalence toward Emerson jibed with his ambivalence toward himself, America, and the sublime.'*
		- ^^*__'Detailing Lowell's request critiques of America's quest for dominance over the natural and political world--and the Ahab-like attitude to the sublime that undergirds it--Hart concludes that Lowell and Emerson 'hold central positions in American literature partly because of their enchantments with a particularly American sublime.'__*^^
		- *'Lowell fired the hackneyed salvo: Emerson was so caught up in transcendental illusions that he was blind to their nefarious consequences in the real world.'*
		- *__'If Emerson's celebration of sentiment, solitude, self-reliance, and a personal Over-soul amounted to yet another romantic regression to the egotistical sublime, for Lowell and his cohorts it also amounted to another endorsement or at least an encouragement of ravenous free-enterprise capitalism and all sorts of other modern ills.'__*
		- *__'As T.E. Hulme, one spokesman for the antiromantic modernist charge, put it: 'Man is an extraordinary fixed and limited animal whose nature is absolutely constant. It is only by tradition and organization that anything decent can be got out of him.' In his New Critical phase, Lowell agreed.'__*
		- *'Those southern and British mentors who guided the young Lowell's thought revered tradition while Emerson often blithely dismissed it. To them Emerson was too democratic, too radical, too Protestant, too American.'*
		- ^^*__'Like theorists of the sublime from Longinus to Burke and Kant, both Emerson and Lowell describe enthusiasm (from entheos, the god within) as a highly charged but also dangerous form of sublimity.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Both realize its potential for personal and mass hysteria, and value a religion based on reason rather than on unbridled emotion. Still, they find a place for enthusiasm in their worldviews.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'As Lowell's biographer Ian Hamilton points out, 'enthusiasm' is a word he regularly uses to describe his manic episodes.'__*^^
		- *'In Emerson, Lowell found a Kantian enthusiast disguised as a rationalist, a homespun philosopher who because of his cool, well-mannered temperament could endorse sublimity and even flirt with fanaticism while still remaining sober and sane.'*
		- *'But to Lowells overheated psyche, Emerson's sublimity and enthusiasm, as Winters insisted, was always potentially pathological.'*
		- *'It took Lowell a long time to recognize the complexity of Emerson's attitudes toward America, religious enthusiasm, and sublime idealism, and to realize that Emerson's ambivalence reflected his own.'*
		- *'In his essay "Sublime Politics,' Pease reveals the social impact of this transcendental repression of nature and culture in American history and offers a critique of Emersonian self-reliance that is surprisingly close to Lowell's and his neoclassic cohorts.'*
		- *'Pease argues that "Emerson does not condone or corroborate these ideological uses of the sublime.'*
		- *'According to Pease, Emerson's belief that the soul should fly beyond nature and enjoy a sublime sense of transcendence got mistranslated into a doctrine of human superiority over nature, a repudiation of nature, and was finally turned to ecological plunder for industrial gain.'*
		- ^^*__'Western expansionism and the simultaneous destruction of indigenous cultures and their natural habitats were the unintended political consequences of Emerson's high-flown ideals.'__*^^
		- *__'As if to clear a space in the wilderness for the Over-soul or bulldoze the American continent into Emerson's primordial abyss, self-reliant entrepreneurs cut and plowed and mined and built until nature withered.'__*
		- *__'Sublimating American resources into capitalist gold, they left a wasteland in their wake, a grotesque parody of Emerson's mystical bare ground.'__*
		- ^^*__'He [Lowell] knows that America's addiction to grandeur and novelty, like his own self-aggrandizing tendencies, is ultimately destructive.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'Their [Emerson and Lowell] contradictory responses to the sublime parallel a contradiction in America's revolutionary past, arising, as Pease has remarked, 'when citizens base their personal identity as well as their nation's identity on a refusal to acknowledge the authority of institutions inherited from the nation's past' even when realizing that 'without a past to inform their present lives, individuals have no basis for present identity.'__*^^
		- *__'Such a crisis, as Eliot pointed out long ago in 'Tradition and the Individual Talent,' confronts all artists who want to be original.'__*
		- ^^*__'Absorbing tradition in order to overhaul it, they appear to reject their precursors while actually incorporating and extending them.'__*^^
	- ### **Moby-Dick by Herman Melville - *The Inscrutable Sublime and the Whiteness of Moby-Dick***
		- *'Moby-Dick-by virtue of its breadth, excess, and explicitly defined themes and conflicts--has all the trappings of an epic theodicy that stands in a long literary tradition.'*
		- *'Works of theodicy, spanning from the Bible to Dante to Milton, are concerned with explaining the ways of God to man and of defending God's goodness despite the existence of evil.'*
		- ^^*__'In relation to this genre, Moby-Dick can be characterized as a carefully orchestrated failure, a failure where the sublime--in all of its obscurity and inscrutability--is set in the place of divine revelation.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'As Richard S. Moore asserts in his exhaustive study of sublimity in Moby-Dick, the White Whale is the 'quintessential sublime' object, a symbol of all that remains inaccessible to the human mind.'__*^^
		- *__'The stories of Ishmael and Ahab point to the failure of the very theodicy the book enshrines: By the end of the novel, the cosmic order does not seem to available to human reasoning, whether that reasoning be obsessively single-minded (Ahab's reduction of all the world's injustices--all that needs explaining--into one symbol made 'practically assailable') or expansive (Ishmael's multifaceted, negative descriptions and 'scientific anatomies).'__*
		- *'But, as Nancy Frederick argues, two distinct plots can be discerned in the novel: Ahab's heretical quest for vengeance and Ishmael's quest to represent the whale through artistic representation.'*
		- *__'Ahab's quest is predominantly framed in the grand, sweeping, theological language, equal parts egotistical defiance (in the vein of Milton's Satan and Goethe's Faust) and Job-like protestations of woe.'__*
		- *__'Conversely, the language of Ishmael's attempts to represent and understand the sublime-which employs multiple forms of discourse and plays with each of them-is never at ease with itself.'__*
		- *__'Philip Shaw offers a succinct definition that manages to encompass many disparate theories: 'Sublimity then, refers to the moment when the ability to apprehend, to know, and express a thought or sensation is defeated. Yet, through this very defeat, the mind gets a feeling for that which lies beyond thought and language.'__*
		- ^^*__'Thus the importance of the sublime lies in its ability to disclose what cannot be explained rationally.'__*^^
		- *'For many Romantic poets, most notably Coleridge, the power of sublime poetry and art to produce transcendent moments of awareness points to the central role of the poetic imagination in human life, the 'living power and prime agent of all human perception.'*
		- ^^*__'Edmund Burke's analysis of the sublime hinges upon the importance of fear. For Burke, the simultaneous apprehension of overwhelming power and terror lies at the heart of the sublime.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'When we encounter scenes that fill us with fearful awe-that somehow imply mortal harm and inhuman scale--we are temporarily transported into a transcendent state of awareness.'__*^^
		- *__'Unlike the merely beautiful, which, according to Burke, only 'induces in us a sense of affection and tenderness', the sublime draws its emotive power from painfully disconcerting images: the immense vistas of the Pacific, the unfathomable power of Niagara Falls, and the godlike stature of the inscrutable whale all evoke sublime feelings due to their large scale (which suggests infinity), their power, and their obscurity.'__*
		- *__'Many have noted the central position of the sublime in Kantian philosophy, as it constitutes a link between what Kant called the phenomenal (the empirical world of sense impressions) and the noumenal (the world of undifferentiated things-in-themselves).'__*
		- *__'Ahab speaks of Moby Dick in a manner that suggests Kant's conception of the sublime: For Ahab, the White Whale is compared to a 'wall,' a limit that bars his inquiring mind from knowledge of the mysteries that determine lived experience.'__*
		- ^^*__'Whereas Ahab strives to master the White Whale, to avenge himself against the unseen reality that hides behind and determines livid experience, Ishmael-as both mature narrator and young participant-desire understanding.'__*^^
		- *'Though their goals are not dissimilar, and at times appear to be one and the same, Ishmael's discussion of whiteness seems to set them distinctly apart.'*
		- *__'Ishmael begins his analysis of whiteness, the most 'appalling' and thus the most sublime of the monster's attributes, by making the task insurmountable: How can the 'mystical' and ineffable' be put into a 'comprehensible form?' Most of Ishmael's discussion of whiteness is a study in meaningful failure. Ishmael's discussion moves through different analytical strategies which are each, in turn, discarded.'__*
		- *__Moby Dick's whiteness is terrifying to Ishmael for reasons he cannot fully disclose, but in his discussion of the question, what stands out in his assertion that whiteness is simultaneously the absence of any color whatsoever, as well as the aggregate of all colors.'__*
		- *__'Not only does Ishmael describe the meditative state, the absorption in 'sublime uneventfulness' caused by the infinite vistas of the all-encompassing ocean, but he also warns the dangers to which this gives rise.'__*
		- *'Ishmael frames this description of sublime exaltation in terms of identity and transcendental awareness; taking 'the mysterious ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue bottomoless soul, pervading mankind and nature.'*
		- ^^*__'Ishmael as narrator is an omniscient weaver of diverse narrative strategies and types of knowledge. These metaphors betray a different conception of the cosmos than the static and stately picture afforded us by Burke, a space where meaning occurs from the midst of flux, an obscure, indistinct and earthly sublime that does not engender transcendence, but rather a profound sense of immanence, of being in-the-world. This sublime, which Ishmael constantly defines in self-defeating, often humorous ways, suggest that the sublime itself is self defeating: What causes the sublime--our finite understanding and our awareness of death--ultimately defeats it.'__*^^
		- *'For Ishmael, temporality, incompleteness, and mutability are what characterize the sublime and its representation in art.'*

		- *__'Samuel Taylor Coleridge is perhaps the most influential theorizer of sublimity among the British Romantic poets.'__*
		- ^^*__'Coleridge singles out Milton's portrayal of Satan, with its 'singularity of daring, [its] grandeur of sufferance, [and] ruined splendor,' as a model of sublime writing. In the end, Coleridge claims that the revelation of Milton's mind 'producing itself and evolving its own greatness' is Paradise Lost's most sublime attribute.'__*^^
		- *__'There are three powers in us, which distinguish us from the beasts that perish; -1, reason; 2, the power of viewing universal truth; and 3, the power of contracting universal truth into particulars. Religion is the will in the reason, and love is the will.'__*
	- ### **Ode to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley - *Ode to the West Wind and Mont Blanc: Shelley and the Method of the Sublime by David Brendan Hopes***
		- *__'A full definition of the word 'sublime' must encompass the simple physicality of 'lifted up' or 'above,' a material orientation as well as a metaphysical phenomenon. It is an excellent word for the operations of poetry, expressing literally 'under the lintel'--that is to say, a door, the opening of a passage from one place or state of being to another--while implying that a certain elevation of perception is required to achieve such a passage.'__*
		- ^^*__'Shelley's perspective is not just more 'sublime' than Keats's; for Shelley, sublimity is the default of the perceptions. Part of his notorious obscurity and the difficulty he presents to students is that a vocabulary natural to the sublime seems elusive or obscure to those who do not dwell in sublimity.'__*^^
		- *__'Even a person whose name appears in the title of one of his poems, or to whom a poem is addressed, might feel herself rendered as a disembodied spirit, as an idea more than an individual.'__*
	- ### **Song of Myself by Walt Whitman - *The Sublime Self: Whitman's Sense of the Sublime in Song of Myself by David Brendan Hopes***
		- *__'Sublimity is not an American quality. The sublime excludes in order to elevate. It is momentary and selective. It is very much a respecter of persons. It is a sensual connoisseurship. It is elite.'__*
		- *__'Yet American architecture aims at, and often achieves, the sublime, and our geography would seem to cry out for it. Somehow our poets have not desired the vocabulary, or possessed the particular will, to communicate at a similar elevation.'__*
		- ^^*__'The sublime requires surrender, and the American idiom has always depended more on will--or, at the extreme, self-glorification--than on surrender.'__*^^
	- ### **The Poetry of William Butler Yeats - *Yeats: Tragic Joy and the Sublime by Jahan R. Ramazani***
		- ^^***'In his revaluation of Yeat's poems and their place in the post-Romantic tradition of poetry, Jahan Ramazani focuses on their evocation of 'tragic joy': 'their affective movement from terror to joy (the psychological sublime) as well as their characteristically violent figures and fragmentary images (the rhetorical sublime).'**^^
		- *'Observing the sublime's long-held association with the literary figurations of death, Ramazani asserts that the attempt to evoke sublimity is a kind of curse for Yeats and his Romantic predecessors, a self-destructive effort to 'integrate with the final form of reality.'*
		- *__'In the temporal structure of the sublime, the anticipation of death gives rise to a counterasserton of life.'__*
		- *__'In psychological terms, the hero and the poet surmount the threat of the destructive father through identification with him.'__*
		- ^^*__'This psychoanalytic model of the sublime can help us interpret the overarching affective movement of Yeat's poems of tragic joy. In brief, these poems introject the violent, paternal threat, thereby permitting the conversion of defensive and pathetic energy into joy.'__*^^
		- *'As Longinus reminds us, the joy of the sublime is ultimately based on an illusion: 'It is our nature to be elevated by true sublimity. Filled with joy and pride, we come to believe we have created what we have only heard.'*
		- ^^*__'In Yeat's sublime poems, words and images seem to have an 'independent reality,' invading the mind from beyond it, each like an 'emblem' that 'sails into the sight.'__*^^
		- *__'Nevertheless, interpretations of the sublime that overemphasize this threat to identity of the subject risk turning the sublime into mysticism.'__*
