- Alright Leach seed 37 finally got over the depressive fucking shit and start a working on April cabulary type of list so the whole idea now though is to have 2 versions of taking notes I'll have to go whole highlighting path jeopardy done and then I'll have the vocabulary path or so I'll have tdo Ah that's the essential vocabulary words And that that though the highlighting path no one once I take 2 of those I'll be able to summarize summarize perhaps or sort oh papa papa I guess summarizes the right words sort of just like take the whole meaning and actually come up with not necessarily just understand Because I feel like we're understanding that I can just really just talk about it but new meaning of creating of using some of these forms in at the end of the vocabularythat I'll have a what is it called it oh I'll write the connective tissue right it's not necessarily a summary but the connective tissue of meaning let's say what can I apply this to like for a lot of the word in contextual bullshit from chapter 2 I can use in one of the patches I do for editing As you know what is the meaning the word making the syntax and all that jazz have a pass for each one of those and be able to talk about each 1 specifically I could also use that same type of language making and understanding as to how certain people of certain areas speak like contextually or like fuck Ah civilizationally or like a culturally yeah why certain cultures speak a certain way they use Constrained words as supposed someone that you they say the whole sentence so to speak but I could use that to elaborate on and really grill down the language of certain cultures and my in the book God God I wish there's still wasn't easier a way to fucking do this I'm being able to just go through what I take and then just write Notes that are not considered part of like sort of the create part of it you know it may be a highlight it differently I think I can do that actually I just have to fucking do it how do I combine these 2 together to one documi think I'm gonna call this document like the vocabulary pass so I have 2 passes Too I can use separately from 1 to 2 or I can just have one combined so I can still have the context of what I what or I could just view both of the documents side-by-side child that way I can have 2 different things but anyway I think the biggest things I need to have the connective tissue just the ability to write the ideas that I have where I can apply to my background information that I've collected in the past One of the biggest ones is doing an edit and then I also can do a reader pass and just identify what the reader is when the biggest thing this where is it called surface text and subtext and then the text butt the text body that's why I want the biggest ones right O out of all of this maybe I need to just constrain it even further as in what are the most important concepts of I'll a hydrocarbon have the vocabulary in a few days and now I have the concepts that I can yeah OK yeah concept page concept pad I wouldn't take the vocab so I'll have that and voke up and concept these
