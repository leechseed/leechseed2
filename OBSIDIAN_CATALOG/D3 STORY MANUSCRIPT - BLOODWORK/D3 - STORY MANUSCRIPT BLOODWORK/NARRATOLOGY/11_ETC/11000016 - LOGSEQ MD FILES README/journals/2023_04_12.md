- Needs to be 61 mouse is dead actually pox somebody from cliff for free was excellent cause youh he only I gave him a little extra as a I'm a deal maker I'm a deal's convenience fa convenience fail at the end of the day you know value equals time for me and the sooner I got it the better I was on a run and you know here I am now Choice is now to either make the full run of 4 or do I split the difference 1/2 and 1/2 I feel like that might be the best real I'm currently I'm trying to implement AGPT into the system of Rita Laria and a strange method I realized now that Perhaps one of the tenants constantly evolving taste and perhaps a nature of the text itself requires iteration and manipulation I mean that by saying that I had to figure out a prompt which works for said book right maybe the idea is to need a prompt for every bto start that from scratch Not even from scratch but basics oh no introduct no no no fucking transitional or introductory phrases fuck that shit more academic and scholarly tunat the basically yet then again I wonder how that affectshit like not balloon but let's sir what's his name OK I've come up with this quad I don't even know if it is a design for data or another design for perspective or guiding me to what exactly I will consider writing it's myth meaning substance and style now I put them to a factorial Just watch 28 or 24 something like that why is it or clothes yeah right so but then I needed 4 of 3 what were the madders so at that point I have 28 different permutations and the reason I do that is because I want to put into a triad of controlling and at that point at the top of the controlling quad God that makes no sense a concept right so it's either the controlling leader B style substance With whatever and so that can add as a sort of a guiding compass twitch what your True North will be the sense of guiding the journey of creating something and now I realize that a lot of people have tried to do this create a method so to speak however I'm not selling this What I do need is repeat wire or yes you hear authorship what is a variety and a delete a controlling a controlling entity entity in the force of whatever that is right so I think what I'll have to do is apply for a phD program either Harvard or Yale And I believe whatever they liked about these page season philosophy is that I don't have to write a paper to get into the thing and whatever the application fee I think it's worth it as long as I get some appropriate feedback perhaps maybe mayb hopefully not just a denial letter relat it easy because what I want to do is I wish I need to do some background checks of AI learned try it now and see where it is and then Cross reference to that and then come up with my own perspective and all that jazz and tackling it and my biggest signal is to have empathy for tecknowledge and and then end the of monumentalization of the wickedness of writing and instead not monumentalize figures but acknowledge methods More than anything I feel like monumentalization is a huge issue when it come to misunderstanding and coming to the truth of something because when you think of Floyd you only perspect if I learn from him is through psychology and no idea that he had a you know critical theory and literature like and that's primarily what hes I don't think he should be taken as not not as a psychologist but it's a philosophic and literary critic you can still view it in that sort of mindset is this Of course he came up with the word uncanny uncomfortable and I feel like when you punch you that uncomfortably you sort of open up the fear of your own mind of the power of it and where it makes its connections and I'm going you could take it down the rabbit hole and understand it yourself better or just perhaps identifying connections and where they've been and perhaps 40 years in this very big underlying current too a lot of mean culture nowadays with the whole mommy milk or tortoise thing Right I just I feel like to be a critic of something and academic and scholarly since it 1st needs to be elevated to that level and I don't know what the fuck it will take I need to understand that right but whole it's got down a lifetime of work though or is it to be a 1/2 of a lifetime so it's a tragic PT to me a quarthat could be 5 years Regardless regardless only the next steps will be it's continued pushing Matt this is what they call wicked work the mundane the unstimulating tseemingly it's like putting all bunch of fishing lines in the water and when something bites just writing it down at a bit and then trotting it down on a log book and the day and when it happens instead of fucking pulling that fish out But you're learning how to fish consistently instantly Twitter catching the big one exactly magic or methodical magical and candy butt methodical design and captivating it's about it

	- Greetings ChatGPT. I require summarization of text I will paste into the dialogue box. The length of these excerpts will be at maximum 1000 words. The length and level of detail of a summary can vary depending on the purpose and context, but in general, a good summary should be concise, accurate, and provide a clear understanding of the main points.
	  I need great summaries. Please do not use any introductory or transitional phrases. Please take a tone of scholarly academic prose.

- ## How do you measure the evil of man? You show him what it is. How to gain and wield. How to rule, and how to reign. How do you measure the evil of man? Knowing power, he still pursues. Not by nature, or by force, but by choice and defiance. How do you measure the evil of man? To know it, and to fear it.
- If order matters when choosing 3 out of 4 items, then we would be dealing with permutations instead of combinations. The expression for "permutation of 3 items out of 4" is written as "4P3" and is denoted by the symbol "P". It represents the number of ways you can select and order 3 items from a set of 4 items.
	- The formula for "n permutation k" is:
	- nPk = n! / (n-k)!
	- For "4 permutation 3", we have:
	- 4P3 = 4! / (4-3)! = 24 / 1 = 24

- Please see it's 60 year after adding right now I've got 6 days left to come in but I just drank a whole bunch of ghost juice so hopefully this will mean somethi've shot your cap of it inside the whole thanks I'll make a crack in a bit right so I realized as I can spend this time doing the bullshit stuff that will be waste on the attic Like do in the elements of the ivory general right now yes sir yeah I didn't do any weed it sounded so rumor anyway so there's some interesting creative elements that I've just started playing a lot of division like the name hot Kelso this is hot Asian chick who's like miss Cox it's also about banging fucking rip and division question She's just like so much moxie for such a tiny little she scares you and that's what makes her so fucking hot do you hanyway so that's hot kelsecond date in the hahahahaha ha how come this is not reduced 2nd bit I'd like goddamn you're supposed to fucking trash your ass slippers 2nd bit is the sidee of the virtue plug I'm acting or comporporated in the summer sort of pseudo science fiction here where the idea is that it reminds you of the division in fact where there are kind of sleeper agent I have planned in your own thing but these people basically it's a metaphor for eliteism and protectorism and I'm better than you ism it's a virtual blog it's a hermit like the matrix you know those things they get plugged into those metal plugs one of them in your arm but you know I'm gonna get your vaccine right And what the 3rd 2 plug is is it basically receptacle for every fucking vaccine and experimental bull shoot that I said the present pass oxygen need to get everything basically nearly immortal to any sort of disease that normal people wouldn't be able to and this thing is very controversial and whoever knows who it is or who knows what it is thinks that yeah conspiracy but when it's real material Nigger I'm just woken up from the drag man that's why I start calling it the drag one Ah very interesting dream I had was in part of this Malaysia I think we're trying to eliminate some wild African countries something I was listening to in my dream and we went in 1st time got does it mated then that Dame and our leader general whatever gets fuckin Shit spooked out of him but then he gets a huge ouch inspirational speech given to him I think there's can't really use somebody interesting then Jason Bourne he gets food hot in his socks and as I fuck yeah let's go and in the middle of his arrest he walks out of the middle of the street I don't know what happens here as you get sniped in the head and killed by a sniper account Aries can't believe what happened and neither can not Jason Morton He would he has not met Damon tomorrow when he gets out hes like what the fuck I'm a boy he doesn't have a butt and his head but then he falls down again and he gets up again like really like this I'm going down like this and then he dies and the gatherers has a taken control a weird part is like we're this militia we did these guns out of the ground like from S I'm old ass I would say old Malaysia and at the time terms of war they bear their guns to hide them so we undig these ground guns out of the ground and then we get into this really weird Ford Pinto or something And we drive-through this city and there's just one older guy remind me of Em Kaiser's daughter something who was trying to teach us the wise words and it's trying to enroll this kind of stuff to back here and then and then at some point will you go to his dad's garage this is a stop before we go to the actual school or something that we're gonna shoot up I don't know as just is fiction by the way and the weirdest thing happens 1 of my friends he gives here's gunshots and he gets ghost cutter hog wild and I bow and he goes outside and he starts shooting And this is a gun fight that has nothing to do with our cause and he gets shot up by some gang stares and the gangsters feel bad about it and then all of us like 6 or 7 of us inside with the dead are like so far what do we like we all decide the realization that we are fucking way out of part depth we have some shit ass guns and some gang seriously as rolled up and some gangsters insert and came in to the garage and say look this is the whole class of ladies haven't right here you already to fight you already go doing this and what are my friends again freaks out runs out and the one guy tries to tell me to stop but then he pulls the trigger and the goes everywhere and the 1 gangster just pushes them aside and shoot them the head like no big deal And that's what I'd like the real fear setting cause I didn't have a gun I couldn't find one and I didn't know it was a good thing or a bad thing but then these guys are slobs squatting at the entrance no 1 entrance no I oh everyone's don't gonna know about today whatever happened they're gonna remember this strange I know strange but that's all I can write but remember that's like the biggest female hat this week Take ahold of what I'm talking about it
