- Early in the leech seed 33 I was really quiet outsin a way just finishing up chapter 8 of the pass through the highlighter in the the book about reading comprehension I'd like 2 or 3 things i want to touch on one is incorporating text structure into the the overall Comprehend comprehension when I'm studying a book and using that to figure out this is actually what my objectives are with the book subjects are and using chapters and stuff as evidence isn't that format other than that like I feel like when the biggest difficulties is linking ideas within the text and I think what I can do is Bring all of this and justing texts rupture and sort of with my and wanted to drink it after what I've done and so I've created a section or a chapter of a book answered what they represent what I then can do is bring that into some sort of a mind mapping software and sort of illustrate connections like that another thing is one thing that I really like about What this book is sort of done and pointed out to me as a temporal structure of before during and after and how similar and like principles and how a theory and how a model can apply to doing something before during and after reading a text on this hole before during an afternoon such a simple model that can also apply it to creating something by how do I apply these symptoms Universal concepts 2 before during an afterso it's planning using those same concepts and then just riding it through all the way through the middle and the ahead and after like I feel like these connections have been trying to be made to me before like in a project management such but it's not always time such a blank canvas I really like cow reading comprehension is kind of bending grand example of how to sort of bridge a lot of these concepts together and once I figure out what the book wants and what I want In the books objectives I can do those passes again right instead of just I'm I can use not like different color highlighting to sort of symbolize different textures according to what the book what the book's goals are specifically in the most concise form what I want in Muslim die's form et ceterand I can sort of going down by chapter by chapter during the table contents I can sort of break down it's Own methodology of how it goes through because there's a method to it the textrapture of like different types of textures it'll be have examples then compare contrasting to different styles and then it'll be a step-by-step methodology and then so on and so forth and then modeling and graphic organizers I feel like graphic organizers are probably one of the biggest bones I've if kind of stumbled upon right it shows how I can model complex in the related nature of how things correlate I would rather feel like I'm like butting heads against the limitations of log sec and/or I just haven't figured out some of the basics and it's getting frustrating because I don't see like a clear path forward it's just kind of equal and stumbling through I think that's something I really struggle with is just when the path forward is not very clear at all you're stumbling through without that you don't get these booms right I'm just taking that stuff forward I just need to make sure when I learn something that I get it out And I've so glad I actually like took the leap and decided to study reading comprehension instead of glow in the story cause I feel like I am kidding so much structure and understanding I'll still learn even more again like I like the sort of a temporal microphone and me going through an independent update like book but then stepping back and going through something broad again in terms of a study and how to study and how do I learn Like maybe after this enough for a step into Maybe character again the next thing I can look into is graphic organizers and really had a sort of bed take that graphic design and shuto understand flows and patterns in such and that may be economic and step in to sit and design and all that jazz anyway I know it's I like that for now do it
