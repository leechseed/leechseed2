- # motion capture to 3d animation research
	- ## open source
		- [Freemocap](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap) open source motion capture system able to use multiple cameras
			- use multiple webcams in one PC for efficient pause/play
			- the cameras need to be calibrated and frame sync'd
			- casual perusing doesn't provide any data regarding the optimal camera count and use and what not
			- the guy developing it seems to know very little about how cameras work
			- big issue he mentions is separating oneself from the background
				- I believe this can be solved thru blankets/morph suiting or even less work
			- I believe using multiple cameras simply provides more data in the accuracy of the capture of a basic IK rig
			- I wonder what the limitations are for this and lets say IK rig
				- static rotational movement of the arm
				- eccentric and closed body positions
				- explosive movements
				- communicative micro gestures
					- neuro-linguistic programming
			- [auto rig pro](https://blendermarket.com/products/auto-rig-pro) for rigging and cleaning up animations
	- ## ease of use
		- [rokoko](https://us.store.rokoko.com/) body targeting motion capture
		- [faceware and iclone](https://facewaretech.com/software/studio) facial motion capture
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1687181066526_0.png)
		- + fits inside an already robust pipeline of development
		- + solves an entire step in the pipeline
		- + integration to other programs
		- - $900 is a lot of money
		- - the program is one of the many programs in the pipeline that require a lot of $$
		- [faceware portal](https://facewaretech.com/software/portal/)
			- **insane** game changing service that uses neural networks to process footage automatically on their servers
			- + reduces manual labor time ten fold
			- + reduces time to learn, train, and attain experience in manual facial capture
	- ## a la carte
		- [face it](https://blendermarket.com/products/faceit/?ref=356) for facial motion capture
		- [reverig](https://blendermarket.com/products/reverig)  creating custom face rigs
			- for stylized character animation
		- [auto-rig pro](https://blendermarket.com/products/auto-rig-pro/?ref=356) creating and retargeting custom humanoid rigs
			- for stylized character creation
		- + much cheaper than iclone
		- - not much support regarding updates. this is an issue because each of the programs only works with the current version of blender
		- - blender is notoriously difficult to wrap one's head around
		- +/- im trading off time for price...i feel like one of these methods will build character while the other one will build characters
	- # AI
		- [move.ai]( ![image.png](../assets/image_1687183326951_0.png)
			- upload your data, let it transcode, then boom it sends it back.
			- + their pricing model is insanely cheap comparative to any manual model
				- for only $365 you get 30 minutes of processed footage
				- for one actor in the scene
			- + the ease of use is insane. from what it promises, i can just upload some youtube video and capture the motion
		- ## For their experimental mode I can use 4 webcams feeding into a hi-speed USB card and then record each source camera in a different instance of OBS...and then output a multi-screen via NDI onto another PC or screen
			- or I can use another PC idk i'll figure it out
- # restricting storytelling to a certain type of medium
	- ## using Vtuber genre as a constraint to animation and storytelling
	- ## can hone in on the craft of 2D animation
	- ## can use AI checkpoints and modeling for character creation
	- ## can use live2D another free program to animate
	- # and the audience is pre-tailored, ez to market to considering how niche the community is

		- ### Transience preservation and sonic authenticity
		- Gain reduction handled by tubes in the circuit which are inherently slow to process but in turn preserves a lot of the transient artifacts of the original recording.
		- #### Use with intrinsically characteristic signals such as a live recording of a piano or someone with an incredibly unique vocal character that you will want to preserve in a mix
		- Use at the end of a vocal chain to round out a signal after using a more aggressive compressor used to embolden the signal
		- - Fills, smooths, and balances empty frequencies in a signal
		- - Aka a 'phat bass' is a bass signal that fully saturates the low end of the master line, leaving no room for other instruments to come out in those areas of the mix.
			- Then again, it shouldn't matter if you're designing the signal around the occupied low end.
		- Of course there's ways you can fux with this, like I wonder if you fed a full send tube compressed bass signal as a side-chain thru an EQ, squashed the low-end (preserving the high-end artifacts that make it thru the EQ), returned the signal back into the compressor, and blended the sound to give the bass a bit more dynamic depth?

		- ### Aggressive Fast Attack/Release - Color, Texture, and Character
		- #### Great when live recording when mixed into outboard monitor for the artist
		- Used on instruments, vocals, etc. that need to 'cut' thru a mix.
		- From my understanding
		- FET is best used in 'parallel' with another compressor IE:
			- - splitting the signal in two sends
				- one going going to (for examples sake) a tube compressor to gel a mix together
				- the other going to a FET to isolate vocals so it can cut thru the track
			- - return the signal to blend it with an EQ

		- Audio Signal triggers a light source to glow when it reaches peaks at a certain intensity
		- A photocell then captures the light energy and converts it back into electricity thus attenuating gain reduction at 'the speed of light'
		- #### optical compressors are the tragic heroes of the compression world. While the compressor literally uses light  energy in its process, it is nowhere near the breakneck speed of a sci-fi battlecruiser. One would could say that, ironically, an optical compressor is one of the slowest things in space.
		- Instead of basing gain reduction on transience, brute force, or whatever VCA compressors are, optical compressors base its modifications on the average intensity of the signal
		- Primarily used when **mixing vocals into a track**
		- By nature, pop-vocals do not have a lot of dynamic range,  so by using an optical compressor in parallel to a mix, a **vocal track can float on top of a mix**  allowing the words to be clearly understood without dampening the signal from the instrumental track
	- # VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifiers) Compressors
		- ## Neve 36609 - SSL G-COMP - API 2500

---
		- The most technical, flexible, and complex and professional compressors used primarily on mastering tracks
		- While the previous 3 compressors are characterized by their strengths and faults, VCA compressors are known for their ability to isolate and modify every sonic element within an audio signal without distortion
		- ## Use on single tracks/channels in a mix
			- ### VCA's are known to be 'transparent compressors' used to preserve the original character and dynamics of a channel while considering its place within a mix
		- VCA Compressors have the ability to sonically mimic the other 3 compressors.
