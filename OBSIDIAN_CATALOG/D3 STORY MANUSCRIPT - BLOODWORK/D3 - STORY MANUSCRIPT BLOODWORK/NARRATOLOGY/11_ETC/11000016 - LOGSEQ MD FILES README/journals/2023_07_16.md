- **Patterns** (otherwise known as Design Patterns) are recurring forms or arrangements that offer guidelines to artists for creating balanced and engaging work. These patterns serve as fundamental structures to enhance aesthetics and functionality in artworks.
- **Designer Patterns** refer to unique patterns or styles that a designer develops based on their intuition, intention, and personality. These patterns aren't universal templates but rather are individual aesthetic or strategic preferences that the designer uses consistently across their work. Over time, these personal design patterns may become distinctive characteristics that identify and differentiate the designer's work from others, reflecting their unique creative vision and approach.
- **Memetic Patterns** refer to design elements identified in various media, gathered based on personal sentiment or adherence to established design language. These patterns are not necessarily created, but rather are found and appreciated, often resonating on an emotional level or reflecting conventional design principles. They can serve as inspiration or reference in creative processes, influencing the formation of new designs or aesthetic approaches.
- **Peer-reviewed (PeerReviewed) patterns** often referred to as referential sources, establish and recognize patterns that shape a specific design language and the commonly accepted practices within a certain subject matter. These patterns, having undergone scrutiny by other experts in the field, offer a reliable foundation for developing design approaches and serve as authoritative guidelines within the industry or discipline.
- **Purpose** The objective of a pattern category schema is to generate precise, robust data for creative patterns that are unique to specific media types, while concurrently establishing universal metadata that is clearly defined. This approach fosters the creation of distinct, high-quality, and proven design patterns, which can subsequently be leveraged to construct a larger architecture of intellectual property and creative products. The schema's purpose is not only to organize and classify patterns, but also to serve as a catalyst for innovation and quality in the creation of new designs and creative outputs.

- media core metadata provides descriptive multimedia content solving the design problem of accurately and efficiently retrieving, analyzing and querying data. the Media Core Metadata Schema is based on the DCMI Elements 1.1 Metadata terms. Using this standard solves the design problem of a multimedia creative standard, allowing the querying and comparative data analysis of patterns across intertextual media which is a core requirement of the pattern database system
- Media Core Metadata provides descriptive information about multimedia content, addressing the design challenge of effectively and accurately retrieving, analyzing, and querying data. It utilizes the Media Core Metadata Schema, which is founded on the DCMI Elements 1.1 Metadata terms. Adhering to this standard resolves the design dilemma of creating a multimedia standard, facilitating data querying and comparative analysis of patterns across different media types. This capability is essential to the functioning of the pattern database system, enabling comprehensive and efficient pattern analysis.
