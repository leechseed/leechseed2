- Alright let's meet 17 about halfway done through with the last balloon the trickster book smoking some weed have said about 6 more 7 more Evan Moore essays to go through and yeah before the trickster I did the taboo which in my opinion was a little bit much 20SA20 fucking essays on inside And fucking add a personal electric complexes like employed Jesus I believe there is some truth to with the God damn man God damn man there is a point when it gets a little too much you point where it's definitely possible to go say from the rum of taboo to cycle psychological Deviancy and I want you to stress but sickness so a lot of what I've been trying to figure out is the next steps of what I'm doing realize it's only been about a month though no so it took me about a month to do to do do with the notes about 15 books take notes Maybe I should try and cut that in half for analyzing so maybe 2 weeks or 3 weeks just feeling it out bring it out of what I should take the do a do a analysis pass or a yeah data yeah I am like gathering pass right probably what I want to do 1st Simply get my bait like just base opinion and and intuitive musings on on what I have take it down notes wise blue sky as to speak and and the whole idea is to again using these translate using these trinketed notes no and a sort of fleeting thoughts that I've had while I was writing these "down and direct statements is to then Create some sort of individualized and nuanced thoughts and after that is when I will twhen I will take all of the relative information and the data and analyze it and then summarize it and come to a conclusion why it's so 3 steps so take the notes right 1st it's it 1st it good said that is to disseminate the information that you're taken you're taken and break it down into lookinto what consumed the information disseminated it break it down And put it into a form which is a lot easier to comprehend and why you're doing this you're also you know thinking about it while you're not mindless you're taking notes down right you're actively engaged so when you can bring the context out your reading the full brochure and the "to come with your own ideas with your own ideas I think it's important to be actively listening because we're actually participating because Otherwise you're having to do twice to work and let and later on and having to re refer to the book I'm in you're always gonna have to do that but to a point where we're reading the book and I just waste so much time so it's better too optimize and efficiently pay attention engine fire consuming notes we notes artemy wants to Actually you start practice writing like fine that book with a bunch of prompts let's go what did that text you know a cognitive mode cognitive power so so in a way I feel like I will be be taking away and energy from one system to another and in the end I get me your results both ways so Perhaps one thing I can do is just think about it about it the prompt maybe just go over old stories not necessarily do anything with them but 2 but too kind of a jog jog a bit my mind with what I've learned so far using theme I'm according to Bloom cause I've been doing that a lot passively anyway with over exit out and I'm exiting sex especially man man complete it's only been a month Jesus felt like a fucking wild ride malright man I'm just getting started to the next thing is to just do the studio analysis oh cause the interpreter so there's like the translation the interpretation yeah interpretation yeah next you do it beauty interpretation to interpret After that median analysis and conclusions that's about it
