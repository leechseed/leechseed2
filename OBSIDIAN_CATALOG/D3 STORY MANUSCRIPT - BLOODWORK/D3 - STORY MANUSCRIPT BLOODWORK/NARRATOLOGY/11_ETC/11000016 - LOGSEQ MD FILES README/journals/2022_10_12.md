- I didn't reach you to 16 it's raining outside I just want to talk about the sublime and I'll be the biggest thing God that was such a fucking dense weed anyway the biggest thing I've got from the sublime was that the supply is a feeling that transcends words or speech or you know leaving someone speechless and it's interesting because it's sort of feeling about only existed while doing an activity right so it's like lebron James doing a crazy ass mover you know fucking faker what kind of movies are those In the sports I think like Michael Jackson doing his full spready evil donk for the N1 thing is that when he is in sublimity when he is in his flow it's great something amazing it's Matt amazing it's almost reaches beyond his own control right it bleeds into the viewer and whoever's watching and whoever's there a speechless moment a moment that will never happen again and it took me was interesting that Bloom pointed out that this occurs for their reader when they are reading and an audience cause I couldn't put a word to it I would always call it a roller coaster so what are really like someone like Christopher Nolan cause you can tell hes studied the sublime in the way that he paces his films it's like the whole film is an exercise in it each scene is an exercise in it and the momentum just keeps moving at least when you're watching the film it feels that way I think it's very difficult to judge the sublime and retrospect but it is OK to try and pick it apart and understand what makes something sublime and I feel like I have that type of style with my writing as well especially when people read it like the way I have my sublime in the way I exercise that cause there's different types of romantic sublime and everybody defines it differently I'm able to really bring people in the scene right to see and build a scene within a certain mood with my descriptions my descriptions when I'm not so good at things of stuff in between the people talking what are they talking about you know the thematic stuff and I think that's what studying all this theme helps me out with feel like sublime in the sense is not necessarily a theme but a phenomenon but a phenomenon that the writer wants to accomplish and I really believe in it like I don't know if a full mob can be achieved the sublime but I know there are moments in the movies for moments and books that you remember is there a purely sublime moments in the sense that everything comes together comes together in a way if you magically every single narrative device it all leads up to something and you can even call it at the climax of it dreamlike in a way I feel like it would take a fucking novelist whole lifetime to write something entirely in the sublime To really just lose yourself and a book and I have done that before I block myself in Box however however I truly do believe that myth is that of an age tied to an age like when Bloom talks about these great authors or novelists or creators of their time and how they're like kind of the cannon of you know Western literature it's difficult to sometimes consume what exactly is written because it's not written for someone like me it's written for someone of that age And to really conceive what exactly that person is trying to do takes someone like Bloom to kind of jog yourself and to sort of look for something and I think it's true it's up to the writer and the present writer and time to sort of unpack these mysteries and lessons from the past and to translate the moment to that of now like Ahab and the other dude in freaking freaking the Moby Dick dude holy shit you I see those types of relationships all over media and they work by the thing It's when the 2 people are off pursuing the cosmic 11 is so pursued by the quest that they don't ask why don't ask why while the other person is so preoccupied with asking why and the meaning of it that the other person's questions are loyalty and it's all such an interesting and dynamic type of relationship because that plays out everywhere and in the end Moby Dick is at tragic end of such a thing but I've seen it and a positive wait cause you have the same type of relationship between curb and spot right Kirk is so emotionally driven sometimes to complete a quest while spark it see things rationally and some of those irrational does not equate to the irrational and when both of them are wrong it almost can result in something sublime right right next to blue I have 2 more left to boo and the trickster you're so fucking close man maybe that's it
