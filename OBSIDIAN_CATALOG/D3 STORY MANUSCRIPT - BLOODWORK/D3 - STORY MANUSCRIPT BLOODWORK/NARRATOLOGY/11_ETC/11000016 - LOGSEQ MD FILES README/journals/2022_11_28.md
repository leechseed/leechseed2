- Alright let's see 29 just a scene structure with Mickey learn a lot about turn turns and setup's payoffs don't letwas very structured ribbon and in depth structure and more microcosm level as opposed to sort of the act level Sort of analysis what I really like about is what my favorite thing about it was probably synthetic on how dumb I'm as are basically just trying goals to do there the 2 evils or too great is a direct and unreconcilable decision or a rabbit a reverb of rabbit a mythical that could be there in reconcilable decision or 2 great things I think it's like too bad you're too right it's never easy it's like a good reason to evil is this is not a story Morality is not really a story because given The Choice everyone would do the right thing but the right thing is never easy and I think that's a whole idea with the dilemma though what is the right thing it's already at this triangle right the dilemma triangle I'm trying to see how I can apply it to apply depth to an irony wow to the story you can apply this triangle to you know the 3 levels of conflict cycle character Turn on the pledious dramatic controlling idea through all of this and it's very interesti believe and especially if this was layered like in 3 different dilemmas than that kind of elaborate what goes on within the aquarium 2 and a 3 but within the script of course the of course it leads up to the climax where all 3 dilemmas can possibly come together with one decision Kind of brings it all together while I guess the 1st 3 parts are just while the rest the 1st complex are discontacts right is almost what it feels like shitty part about it but um honestly at that point it's the story seems simple almost too simple how do I because it simply doesn't mean it's easy that means it's bad right I should not be able to I should not be fucking worried about that you're not this really freeze up the mind to do other things right structure is really figured out for me now I feel like character character again but then again a lot of what character is going to body the controlling idea in the counter controlling idea I'll have all about these ideas with McKee I mean with that Bloom all the stuff hooks up I really think I need to go back and look at Bloom and try and dissect and try to I want to create this idea of heroic blooms Western cannon army or Western cannon corps because I want to design it like Napoleon's cored Marine Corps because hes fiftein core things it's not theme or it's definitely not theme but these are likely 15 core parts of what he believes are present in the Western cannon and they're all 15 different parts but they're all there's several there are many of them that are like very similar I'm just turning into like a pirate maybe of um I didn't be interesting I feel like that would be the model of the Arab Bloom's Western Canyon core I feel like the idea is that incorporate yourself in the cannon should probably have some of these in your story a the conflict and the sublime and the pursuit of that and we're dying all that shit And I think what these highlight are are key things that really resonate with people not necessarily like the choices are what make people love it and like it and write about it not necessarily requirements but these are the things that yeah anyway that's about it
