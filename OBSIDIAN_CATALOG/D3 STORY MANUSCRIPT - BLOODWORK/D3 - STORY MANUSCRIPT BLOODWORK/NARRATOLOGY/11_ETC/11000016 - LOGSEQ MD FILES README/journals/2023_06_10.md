	- ## The Horns of Perversion
		- ### Imagery
		- Naota has a horn that grows in his head
		- Its weird, perverted, and has a sexual connotation
		- Useful for illustrating the uncomfortable mess of puberty in a way that captures the awkward physicality and shamefulness when it comes to poppin a boner in public.
	- ## Feckless Boy and Hopeless Girl Frame
		- ### Frame
		- A pose/frame of Naota being smothered by Mamimi
		- Represents boy who is given everything normal boys love, but is occupied and tormented by something he can't describe
		- Useful for presenting an enigmatic main character who is deeper beyond the typically associated personality of someone that age

	- ## Planes Always Leave Me
		- ### Imagery
		- Classic Japanese symbolism of foreground clouds and plane silhouette
		- Represents how Naota and everything he cares about seems to be in transience except for himself
		- His brother left, people are leaving in general, off to somewhere exciting
		- Useful for illustrating the theme of abandonment
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686382708096_0.png)
	- ## Piss Pastel Aesthetic
		- ### Aesthetic
		- Colors are hued towards red/orange/yellow to represent the steam/heat generated by Medical Mechanica
		- The overwhelming pressure and influence is everywhere in this town, it even changes the color of everything
		- Placed in contrast to main characters like Naota, Haruko, and Mamimi, their costumes are in dramatic contrast, colorful and sticks out of the piss pastel.
		- Correlation to the Backrooms IP, an endless wasteland of hopelessness
		- The ones that are foolish enough find ways to leave
		- But if you're a normal person, you just accept your fate. Nothing extraordinary happens here.

	- ## Sour Drinks
		- ### Food
		- Food will always be symbolic if included in media.
		- Its something that is prevalent in eastern film, not necessarily in western
		- In this case, sour drinks for Naota, represents the situation of his life.
		- He didn't ask to be born into this world. He wanted a sweet drink. He hates sour drinks.
		- Mamimi doesn't care. She drinks half of it, and hands the rest to Naota.
		- 'Here, its yours anyway right?'
		- Naota throws the drink to the ground.
		- Like a boy, he throws a tantrum. Kindness doesn't matter, because it isn't what he wanted.
		- Defiance is characteristic of this stage of growing up.
		- Paired with the attitude of Planes Always Leave Me, Naota is just a pissed off at his situation, nothing he can do about it, so he rebels in rude and unproductive manners.
		- Useful for illustrating the gravity of a young boy's situation in a small meaningless and misunderstood act of defiance.
			- Deep down, ya boi struggling.
			- However, he has no way to process it, and the audience has no way of understanding it.
			- Frames Naota in a dualistic manner.
			- Empathy when Feckless Boy, Planes Always Leave Me
			- Disgust when Sour Drinks
		- Gives room for the boy to grow

	- ## A Soda Half Full/Empty
		- ### Philosophy
		- Mamimi hands Naota the sour soda and calls it half full.
		- Naota doesn't say a word, but his silence speaks of 'half empty'
		- In relation to Piss Pastel Aesthetic, and Planes, both of them are left with half a story told.
		- Sudden Discovery: The flavor of the drink is lemon, and in dramatic irony the drink also looks like piss.
		- Naota's brother left for America so quickly its like he disappeared out of thin air.
		- For both of them it is a traumatic loss that coming to terms with is difficult.
		- Mamimi takes a positive stance, an almost dreamlike psychosis as a method to cope eg: glass half full
		- Naota takes a pissamistic stance, a realist fuck this shit type attitude: glass half empty
		- When both of these perspectives clash, culture, youth, and a gap is opened to play.
		- Useful for philosophic depth illustrated in a simple visual designed outburst.
			- creates a sense of depth and wonder
			- some theory/critics may dismiss this pattern
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686384435664_0.png)
	- ## Naota's Red Bat of Courage
		- ### Symbolism
		- Naota grips one of two remaining vestiges of his brother in America.
		- One is of the Red Bat of Courage, while the other is a Letter from America
		- The Red Bat represents Noata's last remaining symbols of the memory of his brother
		- In contrast to the Letter from America, the bat represents who his brother was, while the letter represents who is brother *is*.
		- Naota grips the bat as a form of courage when confronting Mamimi in a Soda Half Full/Empty
		- Useful for eastern illustration of courage through sentiment.
		- Interestingly, its a better use of Arthur's fist.

	- ## Look Left for Dissonance
		- ### Frame
		- Naota and Mamimi are both framed looking left on a bridge.
		- Symbolism of a road going somewhere and that Mamimi is ahead of Naota
		- Naota behind with a bat
		- Mamimi ahead and not looking back
		- Mamimi is ready to get over her brother ref A Soda Half Full/Empty
		- Useful for illustrating a crossroads and an opening gap between core characters
		- Two possibilities: either they resolve their differences and move on together, or...something else
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686384629618_0.png)

	- ## Deus Ex Vespa
		- ### Frame
		- Slow-Motion shot expositing the enticing incident in a way that is cruel and unusual
		- Useful for levitating a deep existential crossroads that the audience as well as the main characters are not capable of tackling yet.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686385003438_0.png)

	- ## Escalating Strangeness thru Fisheyes
		- ### Frame
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686385444512_0.png)
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686385470201_0.png)
	- ## Manga-Spit-Death
		- ### Frame
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686385568393_0.png)
	- ## Signature GAINAX No.1 lazy exaugurated strange frame
		- ### Signature
		- Gainax has this lazy way of expressing character.
		- However, it is so signature and strange that it I believe, in a way, its a blend of business and creativity that is genius.
		- Haruko and the nature of FLCL has an experimental/indie rock aesthetic that wild and interpretive animation is par for the course
		- Useful for illustrating an attention grabbing strangeness while balancing a budget for the suits.
			- Prioritizing this moment as crucial for development while balancing the variable of budget creates constraints that can be fucked with to a certain degree
			- as long as the aesthetic is ubiquitous throughout the project and executed with confidence, I believe you can really make this shit work

	- ## Signature GAINAX No.2 Money Pit Shot
		- ### Signature
		- In comparison to Signature Ganiax No.1, No.2 expresses Gainax's signature of throwing all the money to one shot while trimming the fat on the previous.
		- No.1 -> No.2 creates a architecture of wtf style that is one and only to FLCL
		- From lazy frame to full on 2D -> 3D animation pipeline is insane and fuckin' improbable, but that's GAINAX
		- Useful for illustrating the lengths of absurdity one is willing to go for, like the sheer balls for doing this....practicality though its who GAINAX failed as a studio but made it so loved in retrospect

	- ## Signature Gainax No.3 Fourth Wall Fuck You Suits
		- ### Signature
		- Gainax breaks the fourth wall by recognizing Signature No.1, and No.2 through breaking the fourth wall and recognizing the commitment and resources taken to produce No.2
		- Useful for understanding the culture and straight 'creativity for creativity's sake' mission of Gainax
		- IMO - cheesy, unnecessary, and apologetic.
