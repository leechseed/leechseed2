- HC69 congratulations finest number in the land so we've completed chapter 1 of 32 of the book and I think the only thing we can do is just to keep going this is going to take a minute although I think I can speed it up Actually it's going to be very fast anyway because I've already spread it out I just need I've already appreciate apretty do I can remember what I did to turn the books into a next I'm scared to look it up again fuck me dude I think I did it through pytjohn I just have to look it up again I think I read I hope I wrote it down somewhere but anyway I'll be able to look it up again I was even able to split it into 800 chunk words like chunks I'm over that too like even I'd like even a church BT was actually able to code it for me so no no worries there I can just have a code for me again it's just a lot of work man this is the gri really want to be able to just I'd slow and steady ones are really just keep everyday just get some of it done That's the goal I was able to do a little bit of analysis on beginnings and he got a little bit esoteric there in the author but I did clean from it with the whole idea is that there are no beginnings there are no ends context is what can provide the beginning in the end because ornetius alley at avor every piece of art is intertextual and it fits somewhere along the line of Art and somewhere so it fits in between somewhere and I think understanding that there is no beginning and end there's an author the freedom to understand what they're beginning and end is for the book and also a lot of non answers of how you don't know where the text begins and when the text ends you don't know who started the tax who entered the tax didn't write OK that's just trucking lucider jerlisten to a jerk and off right I tried to extract Something but it's one that's the way decided was that in the and why there is no beginning and there is no and I feel like it is I think what the use of trying to do is lose today that it's a grand gesture to start a book and start a piece of literature And it should be taken very seriously the beginning of it because why do you choose to begin is where it'll starts for everyone else and now you can read it on your 1st weekend or 2nd and 3rd weekend at that point it just becomes fucking jerk enough but do a certain extent whatever they like from TS Elliott is a set whole idea of war of intertext to a hoodie where you belong your text just derivative of another Tech it's always introtectual about their texts and other things and it's it sort of backs up the notion that Studying all of this stuff studying the text and not writing for the 1st time naive reader is something worth doing like the passage I'm choosing of not by uh no buy one's read once I want it by text to be I'll get I'll get I put my heart and soul in a shit right and it kind of offends me when people just Right for their audience words cooperative I write what they want so Jesus fucking what the fuck do people mean so many people don't know what they want if they did know it they won't write I have so much to fucking say I just need to have the fucking patience to learn everything I need to before starting chachi BT is helping you with that Every fucking step of the a very little bit-by-bit aside from that I really think I can do the whole on select the Box that I believe will be I think I already've done that actually I just keep watching books actually just for fucking shits and giggles oz I think the processing is really fasked I think what just took so long was to get to this point a rate of time how long it took to do I think only took me 2 hperson you know one chapter I had to good do Danny Terry visits meani understand it why don't
