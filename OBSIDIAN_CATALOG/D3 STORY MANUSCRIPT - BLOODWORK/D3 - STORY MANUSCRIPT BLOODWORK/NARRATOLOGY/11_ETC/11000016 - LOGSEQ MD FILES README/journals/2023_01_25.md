- Or at least she'd 43 been sitting here waiting for my blood work Is fucking elements like it's literary elements Can you identify definition shit we're gon to have to make a knowledge book or something Plus like a lot ship So the idea is to be able to apply all of this stuff Or the smallest unit of a sentence All the way up to the largest unit don't literature which is a book I mean of course we can go even further than that you know a series and what not but like let's just keep it I don't fucking book for now and for a movie it would be a film write or be you know this the script right and then the act then sequence shit then scene beat set around no one McKee brings the word event and it's not necessarily a scene or a sequence it's more of a other I would let's call it's an inmediate rest time unit right this is an event that's happening right we are going to the workshop and the unit is does the event unit it is it is a process it's a moving of time like it's not necessarily a sequence because the sequence is derivative more or less at the negative Uh the fuck do you call it charges it's sort of what a lot of that is aimed towards and it's a different temporal unit of time than something like an event which is more of a containerized unit that is just sort swim of to not necessarily in product it's it's more to create mutual understanding I think it's more to create context an event a what is it called a fucking Waking up is an event it's like A-day minutes right but it's it's more heavy than that it's I'll have to do more research in it up but I really think event does not belong in the same space as something like a scene and what is it fucking sequence beat all that just like a guess event would be more like a conversation or a meeting in the office It's like the office part is the replace the event is the causality that's what it is it's causal it's a causal value of time it's sort of the femoral understanding of it's like a battle it's that sort of mutual understanding of that telepathic understanding with peep like a multiple entities of mindfulness that they all understand that this is a thing Without communicating it in such a way like this is a battle or we are going this is a video game and everyone doesn't have the like it's a it's a it's a causal unit of time right so like that's basically what it is so I just need to be able to say like there are these events are made up of or work with sequences and ax but they are inconsequential motion and it worked really well with at see locations because I just more variables and the more stimulation it is because the more you move And the more these events Edison's virtually designed and put together the more you are engaged because that's really interesting actually but anyway what I was trying to get to is Jesus Christ I'm running out of time here I'm trying to get to is that I need to come like and this I'm gooey sort of a simple spouse interface I want to be able to go in-and-out of oven optically Like a microscope you're from the smallest unit of the biggest unit but see the things these small units need to be of standard you're a structure so I'm like a career road track or like beats in a what is it called a fucking ableton right you're able to set the time in the smallest unit is TikTok like one beat like actually 1 beat and I feel like that's derivative of music that's interesting there's that and then there are sort of made this realization that each 1 of these lines of like of instruments Through the timeline of music is I can add these instruments right and each one of these instruments could be a narrative instrument or linguistic and instrument and all these are put together with are all falling on this timeline and then I can also keep with tempo and like especially if I have a timeline or maybe I should have like maybe there's a different lens that I have to push it through when I go from like writing narratively to something else but maybe that's just something else but anyway the whole idea is that Now I can visualize everything beat by beat and I can also once I visualize that I can go charged by charge and what's interesting I like the idea of modularity of this models and instruments that I can use in the program which would be really fucking interesting like a Weaver on top of this instrument of character or you know massive as a fucking program of synthesized instruments you know and it's as a library of Types of characters and these little do dad's like a fixing that you can modulate and have a very unique sound or not even that but a very unique character and that's just in the way that it's played though that's how it's that's how it's done with the notes but but yeah yet I'm going when I have to start looking at that a little bit more and Russian nesting dollars is probably the best way to put it here and let's do another thing with music there's 3 you know there's trouble there's the mids in the base but it gets way more complicated than that right so is story there is a time a place an instrument
