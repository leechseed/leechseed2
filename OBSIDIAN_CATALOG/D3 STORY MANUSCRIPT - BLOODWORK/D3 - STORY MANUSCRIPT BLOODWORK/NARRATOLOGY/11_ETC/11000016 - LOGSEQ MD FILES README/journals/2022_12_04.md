- I'd like to see 31 got a lot to talk about so 1st of all the behaviors I've noticed after I've finished reading the key and some other books I tend to want to switch lenses in my perspective on whatever I'm doing Percy if I deep dive into something I gotta read a book and then I want to zoom out and kind of context find contacts to it's a reading eating part of me doesn't want to go back deep into it until I Sort of established context and sort of established agreements to change it moves is a possible and back into that tactical nature of figuring out what to do with a specific book one thing I noticed an issue with this wicked it's the subject of writing is that it's going to be difficult to process a lot of these connecting contents and I think I've touched on this before Actually looked up solution to that programming wise and there's a node based program editors a lot of it is rooted in actually visual effects funny enough and digital art so unu E5 has a note editor called flu printhere confluence and I think it has an ability to sort of create custom notes and suthe 1st time I experienced this actually is in a blender they have A note based editor for their compositing tool and I think it would be a perfect tool for it and of course there's a pipeline for more advanced stuff if UE5 doesn't work but I feel like that's a good entry point after that there's no bunch of stuff on get up after that in the sprang outlook I've also discovered I'm going back to looking over Learning how to read and sort of that study tools and I discovered the book called blueprints for breeding comprehension and I think it's the next thing I really want to focus on and because it's a very broad concept that I think it all applied to all the rest of my studies are also applying to identify my audience in a very specific way and Going through a little bit more research a couple steps I decided that I want my writing to appeal to a and IB high school junior senior tahigher level English a literature and through this I'm able to sort of really identify the lexicon of the type of reader in the type of language and Availability of exactly how I can designed my shit to appeal to that and also of course what I like about this choice provide answers that another study guide to it and there's a prolific book attach to the calculum so it shows that these sort of great well rounded authors right at that level Jane Austen et cetera and that's what I personally want to go for and to really identify that that really gives it a concrete creative limitation for me to work with That's a huge breakthrough I'm fucking magic over it honestly that was a note modeling type thi want to adjust my reading a workflow instead of use this much PDF and then writ in word-for-word in 2 lock Zack I'm gonna try this new method where I use Designed ebook reader like call kudu I think it's called and instead of writing word-for-word I want to do another pass or sortconstraining pass or editing pass and really speed it up by highlighting in the program and instead of like taking those highlights and then just basically reversing it like I'll be hiding those and then from the twilight's all types from lock sex I'll be looking at the highlights as well as reference in the book at the same time so I'm doing Baby contracting 2 steps into one making a little bit quicker hopefully more efficient without sacrificing comprehension it's the book I'm reading now and we'll be knocking 2 birds of 1 sound I guess beyond that Z book is backup thank God pouring out for the boys in Germany who got caught also reinforces my sort of Crusade and virtue of open source of providing all of my notes all of my research for free online cause I believe my quest overall is to give back more and leave this place with more than I came with it's not only fulfilled the promise and I would stop to have Rosa Moore hopefully it's it's part of partly it but you a pretty know noble right but that's why I had to deserve a BMW M5 competition edition fuck yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
