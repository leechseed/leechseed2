- Alright let's eat 27 I've just got done with the substance of what story is with twinkie and character is a lot of it is refreshing like I'm a remember reading this I remember Lottie's concepts what I think is different with this time is that I'm learning to then apply it and turn it into a system and being able to do it over and over again as there's a lot of repetition in it and I think once I download out of system there's gonna be a lot less of waffling And more efficiency well instead of wolf like as if taking the time with something is not efficient but like the time would be spent more efficiently thinking about something rather than waffling right at work on the depth of the story while then wondering what happens next more sort of stuff I'm gonna trying to do 2 chapters A-day but you know one chapter is hard enough it's really dense as it is someone might be fine so it's like tight 19 days per book Supposed to eat supposed to 818 a lot more fucking easy to handle but you know the density of this book is like a different type of density as the other one as a parallel Bloom remember his name tonight whereas with Bloom a lot of it is just fucking interpretation and interpretation Of a piece of work rather than this is how you do it well this is much more of a to do than examples and so it's dense in a different matter manner and his density is a lot more eloquent and kind of self aggrandizing in a way the way he speaks and I think that's what a lot of the difficulty is going is really just just staying in the town and I'm fucking type it down no that's a difficult game and anot yet other than that like I really do think I can Go to the rest of the key also but I 1st think I want to set up a system with the original machine storybook and then perhaps find a way to shimmy the other stuff in along with coming up with theme and applying that to other than that I think I need to work more in my pros than anything I have the idea dealing deeper what happens in the ax and just doing the McKee square over and over again in my head but also applying you know the controlling idea that you live in the want and the desire and the world is working against that and I think it gets a lot more complicated when there's multiple protagonistso do I mean there's a dynamic of what you call the factorials right I'm one character influencing this character and I think the whole theory kind of falls apart when it's a spirit specifically thinking of the protagonist Right unless there is a the protagonist right unless you're always consistently guessing who the protagonist is when light came of thrones but I want to think specifically of something like you know breaking bad so I speak well here's the Libra tag and ask right over 9 seasons and it's just that it gets better and better I should really studied that I really do want to study these series is movie stuff or Long form series is rather than movies because I feel like that's more of something that's a marriage between the novel and the screen and away there's a lot more inner monolog that I can talk like kind of elaborate with but I couldn't have the structure off the screen will also be enabled to somewhat be free and explore a lot of the sematic implications within the character you're a faggot feels so good anyway the chili looks really good I'm just letting it ride for another hour I'm gonna probably turn it off and come out here and maybe do a hot dog or something anyway that's it
