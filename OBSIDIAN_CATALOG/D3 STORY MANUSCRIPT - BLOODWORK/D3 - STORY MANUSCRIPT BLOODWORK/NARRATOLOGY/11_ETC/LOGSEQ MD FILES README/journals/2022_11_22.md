- Alright when she 26 I'm about to 3rd of the way through mckay's story a lot of the information is being just reconfirmed and sort of refreshed for me like the controlling idea and all that jazz I'm gonna continue to go through it and find a route to least speedy way to make it happen my note taking skills have been improved and uh once I go through the process again I'm like I tell us sizing and highlighting are that won't be able to break down even it further to the most important parts then after that I think one more step I'll have to do is to sign model of after I kind want of how each of these interconnecting parts works together cause it talks about structure a lot now structure influences these things no character and characterization are different and how structure influences how like they're both influencing each other On the capabilities build a think of them too separately but also understand that they work together that hold a stalled kind of that happens but they were good to go I think I want to just go through I just want to power through the key I think and by powering with Roma key I think that's that's what you're really giving me a good overview a story then after that I can go through Different specific aspects like Joseph Campbell and all that shit the word my studies differ is when McKee talks about theme and controlling idea where connects is the idea of duality what I need to do is when fucking I forgot his name didn't well holy shit The guy was seen the same oh I feel like his true things are the ones that are represented in individualities like slavery and imagination those are true things other ones i guess I've defined as other things and they are almost not necessarily themes i guess they can't be themes cause they're in his definition of theme something that is throughout a story right as a second i really need to come up with either come up go down the definitions or really drill down the key's theme versus Well I can't remember my name right I think I'll just stick with mckees from a flame and abandon the other guys right it's it's difficult to have both or get a controlling idea or him to have a it's a whole idea of what seeing is but more new launched and modeled way of doing it like a legislative theme That's a divide the leech and the seed I think that's why I like the brilliant subtle machine because it's both it's duality and name Think about it it's going to welcome spurs like or is it all just kind of a mess really like the theme and then let's put this all right now as research I'm all just compounding all the good stuff together I think I'll continue to do this until I reach the point to where I can come up with like a good understanding of what it is and then I'll have to create a new graph and then work off have it that way yeah other than that you know which things giving I'm not chilling tomorrow hopefully I'm out of my head around gotta hope I do I really hope
