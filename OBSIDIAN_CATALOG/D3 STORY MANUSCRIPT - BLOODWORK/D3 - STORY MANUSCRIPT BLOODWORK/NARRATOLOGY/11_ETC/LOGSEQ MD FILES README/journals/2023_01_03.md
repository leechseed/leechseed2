- Lucy 0380 my God dude I think I just had one the most emotional fucking intellectually an entertaining moments in my fucking life dude I think the reason I haven't been able to sleep or I've been sleeping so much because I just didn't think I could get or understand it's fucking bto to know an inferentially just sort of understand reading comprehension is 1 thing but then to explain what it is and then to be able to take something apart and then to manipulate it is something different I feel like I can It's one of those breeding the matrix moments II feel like now I can just go into a book with this tool kid I just built exactly like the novel that I want the whole idea between the Italian between thematic and sort of the abstract and inferential text base subtext versus surface text send texts and what is happening and then what is inferred is probably 1 of the biggest dynthis is it's just hard to call it dynamic it's it made it this but it's so Overwhelmingly complex is mind blowing because I 1st have been going on with this idea that theme is at the top of everything it penetrates through everything but it's not so deep that demands a lot of the reader I feel like when you go too far you get something like a gym is work where it demands so much of the reader it no longer becomes entertaining and enjoyment and casual and I think it then becomes a lot more of a circle jerky academic An academic textbase where there really isn't that much inference at all likely there's no discovery with it as opposed to something that is well designed where could you move it just seems so bloated he puts everything in it and so search something for everyone but that's it but then it really needs so much of the people but it's choosing when to incorporate these a femoral and inferential release coherence Type of a themes of of narrative devices went to use them and how much of that tie into the story and that I got that oh my God the surface text of the plot potting is a surface decks flooding in surface decks that the plotting of the service sex must also match the inferential goal of what the author is trying to say and then what the story is trying to tell with the author is trying to say The author's gold and the story's goals with the goal of a story or the goal of the author the goal of the story is syntax the surface goal of the author is the text space the subtext on language it's speed that others using to tell a story the reasin someone Mr. Baldmister bowling formula works It's because he surface text everything he puts everything on the top on top I mean that's all you really can do as a storyteller using oral telling that normal story is that that's the only form of communication they have it very difficult to put the subtext and there's no text base that all of it is working memory and all of it is the working memories being used to just translate everything that is saying there is no background memory there is no hawk what is that word eventually no contextual Pronounce time at the previous sentences unless he States it again and that but that it's very a very captivating type of story bu what the weakness the weakness of this type of storytelling is it highly is dependent on the actual syntax of the storyit's highly dependent on that but it's also highly dependent on Mr. Bowling the way he thing is it's very simple I think it is it's very easy to grasp it's very easy to obtain it's very easy to consume But his fingers want something is easy to consume and it's tasty and delicious and it's full of sugar you want more and then you get so associated to it but you need it and you have to have it and then you're you're bar of oxylons it's like a dictionary guitar and hire retireretard and so this is where fuck vodka I like this idea of sort of Using character to build the woand having theme built through the interest structure in that world and the bout there's a balance that I don't think it's he never really has very well of overlying on not demanding so much of knowing the limit of the reader annoying this sort of automatic comprehension the reading comprehension is a sort of flow into it Rather than just front loading everything giving it everything it's just too much I mean that should only be like when you put a notification next everything you almost have to read everything and that almost gets tiring and that double mean effects just fucks up God this is just opened up a whole new fucking realm of understanding Scott dad I'm grateful goddamn incredible that's ithat's it
