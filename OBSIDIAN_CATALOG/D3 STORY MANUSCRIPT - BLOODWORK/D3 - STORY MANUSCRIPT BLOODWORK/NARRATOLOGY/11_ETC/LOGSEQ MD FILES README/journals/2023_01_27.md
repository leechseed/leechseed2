- 1845 So I'll just break my computer and stop talking great asking me how much ACP U checks hopefully don't have to fucking open it up tonight that won't be horrible but anyway so I just well I was doing that I was working writing in to-do list and I had this thought where I was like Hey why am I writing this down I know there's a whole bunch of to do apps but the thing is thought about prototyping also was in my head and I thouwhen I naturally do these things when I and I write them down it's probably the most simple system Of whatever I'm trying to do the most basic a pen in the paper if I ever end up just going straight to what to-do list it's you often tie that of the lack dude of doing things I that I'm app so maybe this is why I always had the felt the need to write something that was just draw a something or just to write it down is because anyway that is probably the most corporate pool way that I found in the past To jot down an idea or to sketch it I think that's something valuable to sort of comprehend I just didn't had it I've been sort of walking away from it recently because while I hope so the anxiety of coming down with the thought it endstop like in the ether now I may have wrote on a collective developed it a bit and then it's working gone so I feel like that is why I've gone away from using peanut paper for the last year however not doing that last year I guess as helped me find an appreciation and an understanding of what it might be good for me and then I would wait there's actually a whole system I can see myself implementing here and within the whole generative system of creation using blooms mastery thing or whatever I feel like this pen and paper whiteboard me 3rd is my way of creatively Working with complex things because it's large enough to wear unable to take into stock when I'm writing down even with pen and paper and I might want to erase it especially with the whiteboard with the to-do list right now it's good because now it's basically I can really just fucking adjust on the fly requirements right instead of I've anyway I'm able to write down the to do thing and then the kind of like the requirement for that thing so I said like the vocab one section You know it's not it's just woke up right there's it's giving a perfect amount of context for what it is I need to do now we're the big core things that I need to do I'm bringing this into this is that sort of preventing my momentum forward Yamaha to do this vocab thing I'm kind of walking away from it because it's just like I don't know what to do what I need to do after it I think what I need to work on after it is I can continue to take what I did of course I'm gonna go do it to Bloom also but what I stopped at is just what's after that I got the vocab I got this but it gets to the point where I feel like a log sec is limiting a bit because I'm all of a sudden doing a thing works what to do with it and make it a lot of nest and notes and should not I think I might think about like stepping out of it for a bit maybe looking at Abe not a sort of graph base organization and study system tomorrow's of the document based system with Candace cause they're you can call idea instead of Linking notes back-and-forth together and creating and generating ideas it's more about solidifying limited singular ideas like I need to come up with the ideas before I come up with the linking aspect ofbut that's just the hard part now there was this one guy who completely criticized the idea of an Evergreen note system or a second brain system because you spend more time creating the 2nd brain system and not doing anything with it do it agree I understand that But it's just one of those extremists you know sort of cycle of human psychology or complete not a rejection of it's not it of course you just need to take it a couple of levels further to understand how it pertains to me or are we like oxide because I love the mark down system like that is fucking incredible to me it helps you but when it comes to beats and it comes to I like number and I like that I need to have a fucking find that that's a really good idea to go on with the system and try to create the whole idea about each beat Is the the the original minimum unit value what I wouldn't say beat but idea unit is a minimum idea that unit value I plan to track in and beat instead of idea units write in each piece compose of idea units and idea units are well our daily each beat is an idea is composed of clock sentences and sentences are made up of clauses and indirect laws go and you know And I feel like the beat is probably the smallest unit and the idea that each beat makes up a measure and each measure makes up a sequence it's interesting correlating and we're leading not and comparing literally music notation with story that is pretty interesting lol Anyway that's it
