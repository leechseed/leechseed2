- Alright let's see 70 so this one's all about all about how we finished halfway through of chat GPT and summarizing the book so far I've got to just do the last taff according to that part took about 2 hours I think I could crush shut doing an hour I think the most important thing to do though is to fix a coating for the python script to see if I can Have the 500 word blocks out block only after it sees a punctuation market a. Or an! Or what a? I didn't ask it my parenthat's cool simply because I know it is in the sky's books he does a lot of parentheticals and that's really I can think about how I can optimize a script really Aside to that of course I'll have to go back through and do my highlightand then after that I'll do my translating and then after that of course put it down in tyeah what do you call put it in the And then I'll have to afterwards I think whittled there's a glossary and we'll have to figure out at some point but that'll be done later I think we'll be the best way to go about it just to push it onto something somewhere else get the meat of this done that perhaps is probably the most important is the meat And what's that meat is done we'll come back again and then somehow break this stuff down into logical logical chat checklist or like I don't think I even need to transform it into any sort of model model and I could feel like it's too much time though or maybe not enough maybe modeling would be good It's one of think it's because it's difficult in translations to make is to turn a concept into a model and sometimes you just gotta think is it better if it's laser it caused a list of visually representatives right perhaps if multiple component into a hole and like a pie charter something Perhaps that's what it's like the best put on taken I'm from that I need to write this down in the to do listhat's for sure I've done that through observations I've seen a lot of correlation with Bloom the sky and blooms you know reference a lot of the same literature And the fact there is a cannon as boom suggests and I know a lot of I know the word cannon is very derisive and literature that there is a specific set of works that people should read but the thing is it's windowhen there's a pattern there's a fucking pattern Dante Tony Morrison fucking Moby Dick Dickinson What is it called huckleberry but it's like V keep showing and the same spirit theorists like pulled from philosophy showing up like Gary diand what's his name fucking fraud so I think a big step forward after this Of course I'm only referencing these 2 authors I feel like I need at least several more mentions no different Michael Shakespeare conceptions but it's hard to go much further without going into fucking super detail because everyone else doesn't really have this whole introduction to literature type of fucking perspeprivate it might be the widest Might just be the lightest of them all I could look at these other introduction literature books see what they have to say maybe they take up a different perspective because some of them I know this one was done by a British guy but it's publisher no which is an American 1 but I could have the perspective of an American Woodbury critic glendalemerican perspective I probably the best way to go I don't fucking read any other language so I can't I have to be biased against the Western Canyon I mean that's just I'm American it's about it
