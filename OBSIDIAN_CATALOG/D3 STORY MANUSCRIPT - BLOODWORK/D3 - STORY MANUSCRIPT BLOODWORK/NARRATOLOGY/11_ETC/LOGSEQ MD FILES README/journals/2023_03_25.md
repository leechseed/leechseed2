- # Congruence and Consumer Behavior
- Based on the context provided, it seems that the thesis you are referring to aims to explore the factors that influence consumers' evaluation of digital products and their purchase intentions, given the intangible nature of these goods. Congruence plays a critical role in shaping consumer behavior in this context, particularly when it comes to evaluating and purchasing digital products. Here's how congruence is revolutionizing consumer behavior:
- Information consistency: In the absence of direct sensory experiences, consumers rely heavily on the information provided about the digital products through various channels, such as product descriptions, reviews, images, videos, and demos. Congruence between these sources of information is crucial in building trust and credibility, which can positively influence consumers' evaluation and purchase intention.
- Brand consistency: Congruence in the overall brand messaging, values, and identity can enhance consumers' confidence in the quality of digital products offered by the brand. A consistent brand image helps consumers quickly identify and associate the brand with specific values and attributes, simplifying their decision-making process.
- User experience congruence: As consumers' interaction with digital products is mediated by technology, a consistent and seamless user experience across various touchpoints (websites, apps, or devices) becomes essential. This congruence in user experience helps to create a positive impression of the product, leading to higher purchase intentions.
- Social proof and congruence: In the digital space, consumers often look for social proof, such as reviews and ratings, to evaluate the quality of a product. Congruence in the positive feedback and experiences of other users can significantly impact consumers' product evaluation and purchase intention.
- Post-purchase congruence: After purchasing a digital product,

- # Visual Thinking: The Hidden Gifts of People Who Think in Pictures, Patterns, and Abstractions Ph.d. Temple Grandin
	- Temple Grandin PhD, "Visual Thinking: The Hidden Gifts of People Who Think in Pictures, Patterns, and Abstractions"
	  “A powerful and provocative testament to the diverse coalition of minds we’ll need to face the mounting challenges of the twenty-first century.” —Steve Silberman  
	  “An absolute eye-opener.” —Frans de Waal  
	  A landmark book that reveals, celebrates, and advocates for the special minds and contributions of visual thinkers  
	  A quarter of a century after her memoir, Thinking in Pictures, forever changed how the world understood autism, Temple Grandin—the “anthropologist on Mars,” as Oliver Sacks dubbed her—transforms our awareness of the different ways our brains are wired. ^^Do you have a keen sense of direction,^^ a love of puzzles, the ability to assemble furniture without crying? ^^You are likely a visual thinker.^^  
	- With her genius for demystifying science, Grandin draws on cutting-edge research to take us inside visual thinking. ^^Visual thinkers constitute a far greater proportion of the population than previously believed,^^ she reveals, and a more varied one, from the photo-realistic object visualizers like Grandin herself, ^^with their intuitive knack for design and problem solving, to the abstract, mathematically inclined “visual spatial” thinkers who excel in pattern recognition and systemic thinking.^^ She also makes us understand how ^^a world increasingly geared to the verbal tends to sideline visual thinkers, screening them out at school and passing over them in the workplace.^^ Rather than continuing to waste their singular gifts, driving a collective loss in productivity and innovation, Grandin proposes new approaches to educating, parenting, employing, and collaborating with visual thinkers. In a highly competitive world, this important book helps us see, we need every mind on board.
- # Congruence Theory in Marketing by Rober Rollin
	- ^^Digital products are intangible goods, mainly presented visually and acoustically to consumers^^ in the form of videos, images, texts, and music that can be bought, downloaded, or streamed via various web stores. ^^Their consumption primarily fulfills hedonic needs.^^ Before purchasing, a consumer's interaction with a digital product is always mediated by technology. Therefore, consumers cannot directly judge the quality through "touch and feel" experiences. ^^This book diminishes the ability to evaluate digital products.^^ Therefore his ^^thesis seeks to answer which product attributes have an impact on consumers' product evaluation, and purchase intention.^^
- # Perspectives and Theories in Consumer Behavior
	- Consumer behavior is a complex and multidisciplinary field that examines the decision-making processes and actions of consumers when they acquire, use, and dispose of products or services. Various perspectives and theories have been developed to understand consumer behavior, each offering unique insights. Here are some of the most influential perspectives:
	- Economic perspective: This approach focuses on the rational aspects of consumer decision-making, assuming that consumers aim to maximize their utility or satisfaction while minimizing costs. It considers factors such as price, quality, and perceived value in the decision-making process.
	- Psychological perspective: This viewpoint examines the cognitive, emotional, and social factors that influence consumer behavior. It considers aspects like motivation, perception, attitudes, beliefs, learning, and memory to explain consumers' preferences and purchase decisions.
	- Sociological perspective: This approach emphasizes the role of social influences on consumer behavior, such as family, friends, and cultural norms. It examines how social factors, such as group dynamics, social class, and reference groups, affect consumers' choices and preferences.
	- Anthropological perspective: This perspective delves into the cultural aspects of consumer behavior, focusing on the role of traditions, rituals, and values in shaping consumers' choices. It explores how cultural variations influence consumption patterns, brand loyalty, and product preferences.
	- Environmental perspective: This viewpoint considers the impact of external factors, such as the physical environment, marketing stimuli, and situational variables, on consumer behavior. It investigates how factors like store layout, promotional activities, and time pressure can affect consumers' decisions.
	- Neuromarketing perspective: This emerging field combines insights from neuroscience, psychology, and marketing to understand the biological basis of consumer behavior. It uses techniques like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) to study the brain's response to marketing stimuli and uncover the neural mechanisms underlying decision

	- ## Congruency and Customer Behavior
	- Congruency, in the context of consumer behavior, refers to the harmony or consistency between different elements of a marketing message, advertisement, or a brand's overall image. This consistency can be seen in aspects such as the design, tone, values, and messaging of the brand. Congruency plays a significant role in shaping consumer behavior, especially in the online environment.
	    
	  Here's how congruency affects consumer behavior online:  
		- **Trust and Credibility:** When a brand maintains congruency across all its communication channels, it builds trust and credibility among consumers. Inconsistent messaging, visuals, or tone can create confusion and skepticism, leading to reduced trust in the brand.
		- Brand Recall: Congruency aids in brand recall, as consumers are more likely to remember brands that present a consistent and coherent message. This recall can lead to increased customer loyalty and repeat purchases.
		- **Emotional Connection:** A congruent brand message resonates with consumers on an emotional level. When consumers feel a connection to a brand's values and identity, they are more likely to engage with the brand and make a purchase.
		- **Decision-making Process:** Online consumers are often bombarded with a vast array of choices, leading to decision fatigue. A congruent brand message helps consumers quickly identify and connect with a brand, simplifying their decision-making process.
		- Social Media Impact: In the era of social media, congruency plays a crucial role in shaping consumer behavior. **A consistent brand message across all platforms allows consumers to recognize the brand easily,** which can lead to increased sharing, engagement, and ultimately, sales.
		    
		  In summary, congruency is essential in influencing consumer behavior online. Brands that maintain a consistent and coherent message are more likely

- # The Source of Magic.
	- ## Shapes of Imagination by George Stiny
		- In *Shapes of Imagination*, George Stiny runs visual calculating in shape grammars through art and design—incorporating Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poetic imagination and Oscar Wilde's corollary to see things as they aren't. Many assume that calculating limits art and design to suit computers, but shape grammars rely on seeing to prove otherwise. Rules that change what they see extend calculating to overtake what computers can do, in logic and with data and learning. Shape grammars bridge the divide between seeing (Coleridge's “imagination, or **esemplastic** power”) and combinatoric play (Coleridge's “fancy”).
		- Stiny shows that calculating without seeing excludes art and design. Seeing is key for calculating to augment creative activity with aesthetic insight and value. Shape grammars go by appearances, in a full-fledged aesthetic enterprise for the inconstant eye; they answer the question of what calculating would be like if Turing and von Neumann were artists instead of logicians. Art and design are calculating in all their splendid detail.
