	- ## Kobold 9781936781065
		- provides a good framework for organizing the data in a design document
		- has a collection of systems such as fighting, magic, etc.
	- ## Designing Games 978-1449337933
		- VERY very important section on interrelated systems and dependencies
		- How to organize them etc.
		- I can refer to this book when designing systems as small as character, style, etc
	- ## Game Feel 0123743281
		- Hones in on the idea of *feel metrics*
		- These metrics define the multi-sensory experience of a game
		- These metrics can be integrated in fiction writing
			- Input Metrix
			- Response Metrix
			- Context Metrix
			- Polish Metrix
			- Metaphor Metrix
			- Rules Metrix
	- ## RPG systems - GURPS, FATE, DnD, Pathfinder, Shadowrun
		- Pick and choose systems from each of these that resonate with what I am trying to create...character systems etc
	- ## Pattern Language for Game Design
		- EXCELLENT book which helps you create a system and template for identifying core systems from other games or inspirations and identifying what problems they solve, etc
		- **I believe this is really where I should start**
		- **The guide suggests that I create at least 100 patterns to build a language**
		- **Using this pattern method, it doesn't just have to stick with games, it can be derived from anything**

- We'd seed any 22 days in a row today we're gonna be updating on what I did today and what I'm going to do after I'm done with what I did today was agreed I noticed something similar characteristic between all video games R pg's overall games is that there is a role for the person for the player to be part of and that doesn't necessarily mean I can't right a character in that but it's just Like in the division there are division agents in the donor dragons or adventurers in there are champions so right now I guess the I name for these characters in my store called vandals and that is a substitute for a substitute for the I mean in Star Wars there's jedi right so there are vandals so within that to complex a few things I'm barring a little bit from Star Wars and there are 2 sides of admirals there are the virtuous And there's a virtue and then there's the aeventual the virtue in the ventral I think I like that cause I'd both start with the virtue and vengeful so there's 2 sides of them and the inspiration for this is going to be directly inspired in The Bible corner group and booked to The Bible and I really think that's really good for marketing as well to say that the story is based off of EE knock dollar books that are not really traditionally incorporated in the King James Bible And books are like they're like dinner doodle thread cereal or something where they're recognized but they're not included in The Bible because they're partially because they're not really that relevant to what they're talking about but also doesn't really fit with them weather trying to say but there's a big thing the whole idea between Angels and Demons right so there are angels and then there are fallen angels and there's satan and all that jazz and then there's God right and the pantheon of these angels the angeology and the demonology Are can be the basis of this is a sort of characteristic of a lot of the examples of art angels in the hierarchy and other vandals as well main characters and such I think it would be really cool to drive them off of these angels and place them in the story as for powers and such I think what we can do is there is a hierarchy of ani'll need to look up some sort of there's like demonology and shit And then there's like light magic and there's also a sort of biblical accurate angels and what not a lot of them are guardians of certain I really fit well into sort of the where the apocalypses I have it's the and it can fit will within the event Gillian theme of when the skyfall happens when the whole thing where the space is a warrant space and then there's that giant cloud of metal and shit I mean one of them could be there's probably some sort of biblical reference to that the idea being trapped on Earth as a purgatory of such and I think when the grand goals is to 1st you know clear the skies so they could have access to the heavens again which would be kind of cool the martians as well can also pay a factor in this they could almost be seen as arc angels the ones that are incoming tcoming to what we did for the rapture right there are the ones that are chosen or I don't know something like that I'll ask it down to back the brass tax but each one of our main characters are gonna be 1 of these vandals and if you aren't the vandal you either are God or goddess I think that's a whole idea here if they're not specifically marked as blamed for the destruction of society and charged with figure not even charged with but like there is no recourse to fixing it there are the ones that are charged with fixing it oh wait and also that I think when I'm going to do next is I'm going to explore the fate system and the DnD systems And see how they differ and how their character design works I think also what's cool about this GPT thing when I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the outlines of although outlines already have I'm gonna make another page of it and then consolidate all of them together into sort of one grigged base sort of a template document I'm also 1 that explains each 1 of the rules and points probably put that in GPT or something I see here I said from that I think I could do styles I couldn't work on that a little bit I wanted to I really like the idea of incorporating evangelion angels were really allowed me to not only emulate the style of even Gillian but play homage to its sort of humanistic need church this is the whole idea of dualism and the dualistic theory of There is a humanism side and then there is the contact side human ism in context what is human what is context so what is human is what I'm going to derive from my own special area motion feeling which draws into the world and the context is well drawn from the inspirations of The Bible and all these other things oh yeah no I'm gonna jerk off
