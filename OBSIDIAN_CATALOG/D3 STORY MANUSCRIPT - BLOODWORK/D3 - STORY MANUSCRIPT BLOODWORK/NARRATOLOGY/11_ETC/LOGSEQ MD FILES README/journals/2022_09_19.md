	- OK so leaching 9 I want to do 4 things 1st I gotta stop thinking about burnout because it's just gonna be a slow slow slow slot who's what it's gonna be so so I want to take the 4 things out of themes that I've already broken down from his books and understand perhaps the 15 books might be the Cathe key to understanding each part of the narrative design of each one of these components you know it's kind of scared to think about but perhaps what I can do today It's along with doing one of doing the death and dying that's the next book perhaps I can also choose some other books that I have already read and pick out what theme means to each 1 of these like kalar I keep talking about fucking palar and fucking palar and the guy who wrote narrative design definitely I'm sure we have notes on him about which them on him without name but yeah so what did I learn about alienation Whatever about alienation is probably one of the largest and probably most prevalent themes or topos and society society in in terms of today right now 2022 the rise of the Internet and everything our each awe each are much more isolated yes and are almost tragically delusioned what others ourselves are corporations have decided to mean having having for friends like just look at streaming TikTok and all that shit that's massive and I think it's something I can really play upon With everything not just as a controlling topo's butt it's something like a flavor tobos like something that I'm not necessarily controlled the theme but also gives flavor to the theme not like jetty there is one controlling the 1 controlling theme and I you can break it down and 2 do you know controlling idea on that shit but there are also other flavors that you can introduce traduce but should not overwhelm the primary topos like with alienation the American dream goes with the alienation candidathe alienation like like Canada and almost 1 of the books are the blue covers is that To pursue the American dreaminess live almost outside of the society of American society because only then can you really understand what the dream is for you what I learned from the American dream and as that is very specifically started in America but I start seeing it bleeding to other International worldly type of media immediately because of america's control over all over the medium entertainment industry and other entertainment industries trying to Follow that especially with Netflix the globalization of narrative of narrative is is pretty much been sold through Netflix just look at separate punk edge runner and cyberpunk 2077 and at South is the American dream that's like the controlling idea the kind are the topo's a controlling idea is that it's topless to pursue the American dream but when it's the only thing you can do why not silver disobedience do you know not that's another thing silver dose obedience you may have been dreaming isolation and the lation and alienation are like fucking piece in a pod like straight up 100% I think what makes American dream very unique though That is not able to be localized as the sense of being eliminated as not a like an immigrant or being black and not a lot of shows have really done that very well they almost see it as an afterthought like I can just turn this person a different color and you know that covers all our bases on being a cultural things like no fuck off dude that's not how fucking cultural works Jesus Christ I stayed and that's something I really want to touch on for somebody's block in my film they're going to be a black holy and entirely I'm not really tired as well unto so with the obedience in the fact that to be noticed and for your message to be seen when you are invisible sometimes most of the time you have to be to Obedient but otherwise no one will pay attention I really like that about so with a submittance it's also civil disobedience in a way of you know I couldn't really test well until teenage isolation isolation or or alienation this is obedience beatings blackness in the American dream and the root that of civil disobedience is almost at the root of the American dream is that's all America started it's just rebellion right And it's always a dynamic with with power I think that's something I can really tie into what like studies with power dynamics and a power play and BTS MI can really tie that in very well especially with sexuality because that almost seems like the root of a lot of conflict as it is what is in America especially with the type of a westernized narrative plot design conflict no now in terms of conflict I feel like the more I go through all of these wait what's the last one or American dream so what is obedience alienation And dark humor only a dark humor what dark humor taught me is that there are very tropic elements of scenes and one can use specific to each 1 of these themes like there are there are troops that I think are good to put within not a lot of them but some of them that are good to put within to sort of drive the point home to make the flavor clear what you're trying to do that 1 example I use before it's like aint she cute and then she liked birds and then the devil woman says again aint she cute like a dark humor of where she misinterpreted Her initial observation right that's a whole point of dark humor as one thing is presented and it's completely the opposite of the another humor and drama and tragedy are like almost exactly the same thing very observation but what it is you know what you see and what it is and attached at the time no here's a thing with theme and talk oz and they're like controlling Toby or topo's right where it defines what the conflict is outlook is and then the next theme other themes that almost describe how the conflict takes place right to the American dream is controlling right that's The American dream is conflict right dark humor is how conflict can take place within the American dream right while alienation defines a conflict conflict and civilization obedience describes how the conflict takes place like what is it like what is the conflict and how is it hot butt or like civil disobedience in American dream the American dream the American dream the subject American dreams while civil like a deeds obedience is a verb right so elimination is a subject While dark humor is the verb it's like how conflict takes place in takes place in that and I think I can really just I just need 2 columns right a the subject topos theme and the the subject of the conflict and describing the conflict that's basically what the email is right conflict and purpose it sounds like a book conflict and purpose I know what I need to do next so I want to do one more of the books I'll get sick and I'll get one more I'll be halfway there and then after that we're doing that or I can do it with then I can look up more of what these other books say about theme jerk off can never forget that uh look up what yeah other books they about theme and then maybe look into it but some library what genera is like books I couldn't learn about John rucker Stephen John I feel like a well really well together deem and John run and then I'll go into actually the design right maybe that's what's an expert Anyway or character we'll see what happens anyway that's about it thanks

	- Please check the log research log commenting on what I did last night night so I went back and kind of did a bunch of review of enter a review of memory and study and study relatives do what I've already know and I learned a little bit more when it comes to long term memory and short term memory and just a lot of more reasoning and sourcing behind certain memory techniques Murray techniques where facts and numbers aren't as really easy to remember but what are our symbols And meaning pink symbols and pictures are easy to remember because it's easy to attach a meaning to it do it the whole idea of how memories chains of ideas linked to together and that's how great divity works but anyway also added a bunch of steps to my hygiene brushing brushing twice A-day washing twice A-day now also with the mouthwash plus the state tridex For my neck and once my tongue brush gets and I'll be doing that too I'll see her there I also found the small incremental weights for my fucking rack so I can actually incrementally move forward with that so that's a good thing I think I think anyway so with the Added start to do added to the contextualizedude added to the blue notes I added pictures to the 1st set of literary that of literary themes of the alienation took a lot of cognitive energy actually would have tried to do as I tried to associate the themes with pictures of present day metaphors or on which the theme is present in koreand current media kind of helps sort of contextualize and understand what exactly alienation means I'm watered with every single one of my little area Karen I think with Bloom it takes a minute though I think more today I'm just gonna focus on getting another theme done I have to take a kind of slow it's one more thing maybe 2 also found some information about the dark Web but looking stuff up into that just exploring cause I just seem interesting I'm just trying not to burn out with the fucking literary theme stuff man it's a lot of information with not a lot of progress but I guess progress is being made when the theme direction I still need to look at saved the crap director actually That's what I can do to just to glaze over it lead to pride myself a little bit more for the for the jump I did watch several punk edge runners last night which was the animation of school but it's very inconsistent overall it was enjoyable it's enjoyable but ultimately leans in way too much to animate tropes which makes it kind of forgettable kind of forgettable it's interesting because anime tropes kind of push against the grain of what a lot of the the what's some of the criticism of the male gaze And cinema at least story in plot wise otherwise because instead of the the female hero being the character and being swept away by the male is the other way around almost a girl that's a main character well the dude is just a fucking loser blinded by his own youth use an and insecurity very big mama's boy's complex very I'm nihilistic nihilistic not nihilistic Well a little bit more of a pessimistic outlook on capitalism and no matter what you do you're under the thumb of a corporation shouldn't not about this they speak of a really touched on this more but everyone that they could have said something more about how everyone is under the thumb in the corporation that was only just a little bit of what the thematic controlling idea was and like the controlling idea was pretty relevant throughout you're out and she's everything else was just kind of out of whack I think I'm just studio trigger style that just happened to do shit and they don't give a fuck If it makes sense or not there's a lot more depth that could be really mind out of it I think one of the criticisms they have is that they're trying to do too much too little time if they just had more time or more episode just like dude that had fucking 5 fucking hours hours some people are able to do it in 90 minutes right right I feel like a little animation at least in the manufacturing manufacturing sense sense according to the maybe the Japanese or the geometrical model really hampers it's storytelling It's just unfortunate because I feel like I'm also the cyberpunk 2077 universe is kind of crunchy in the sense that it's superficial and it's understanding what love is and all that jazz about a lot of how people are defined by their suffering and their heat and their escape key domestic escape is is about it like none of the characters were really Empath really identify with like you can identify with your mom getting fucking dying and somebody else that the cops is not choosing to save her because of a client but like that's kind of like a loose there's heart loose but weak I think if I'm weak because it's really didn't develop that relationship with the mom as much as I needed to so they info dumped and then to kill it airline there's a lot of time to spend on the R cycle school thing old thing and then they just completely dismissed that art for 5 or 6 episodes not where I have the series it seems like where they could have really developed it and leaned into it rather they went in they had to make you care about the characters I really wanted you to care about them I spent the whole fucking 30 minutes making you care about these people and then killing that Mrs. Disingenuous all those of course and I have houses like well though there wasn't and I don't know I think you're talking about it but I noticed this structural problem from the fact that Sarah punk is cyberpunk or is it just triggered because Killer kill it's great because owned itself up to it as we're compartmentalized like we're just maybe stayed in Arizona perhaps it was just it felt like an extended proof of concept more than anything I just don't think they're model really fitzwell with a Netflix model of contemporaries 10 episodes at 1 time only 30 minutes I feel like you'd only you should only release that type of way if it supports inherent but supports inherit narrative never It was an anime for 30 minutes long it just doesn't really vibe check that well in that case that's a big people consume those that you should adjust man fucking media is evolving and it's annoying I'm just trying core to get concepts the down once I get that done and study how the media works I could adjust but the core concept of what narrative style narrative designs is the same so save the cat and do it get a theme done add some pictures to the American dream American dream think Web browsing dark Web browsing Hold up on the hotel I think I said I think
