- # installed a local web-ui to experiment with llms.
	- installed some cool characters lol.
	- however, the characters seem to break frequently if stress tested.
	- In terms of my current understanding of llm's and characters, I don't think I can really do much more in terms of developing these characters.
	- I need to focus more on establishing the framework.
