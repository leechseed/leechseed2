- 1890 congratulations made it so after some sleep I'm pretty sure I slapped 90% sure I slept anyway so my friend's been refreshed got to me hydration moisturized and a lot shit I'm trying to implement so outside the pivot away from the data and sort of the software design side for a bit and actually I'm back to the roots and conceptualize my theory of narrative which I think I have which I do have basically I'm just gonna have to output it in a model and just paid app on the board was only through doing the database stuff that I actually found it it was really cool and after that I re-downloaded some paoyo how some composition books on methods of hot doing of writing and I think what I'll do is all study these books I think I'll just do a green layer Do some highlighting from each chapter and from there a I'll be late you know with the general I'll take the basic thing of it talks I guess and just plug in sort of these theories and such into those that I like and from there are great models and templates actually what I'll do is I'll do that I'll need to make a template first that's the biggest thing like have a template for a shit build off of that Because I'm just becoming the data Lake so I want to really just start with pillars I'll allysander's method is that it works she yit look at our shopping I already have the books so I think we're gonna I'll put all that stuff in an obsidian template actually Growl growl I think she has a workbook online ready I should just go ahead and download that then create internet to some sort of form it's easy once I turn into that form then I'll be able to develop for that but I really should place some Diablo today it really does move my character forwarding that maybe some violent But the stuff today is a print out the narrative theory theory nerve design and then after that we're all uh religious plate after that we'll look up to Larry's workbook go where the workbook and and I need to find a way to I guess I'll just do it in the city and write I'll just create a template And I'm sure there's a way to somehow duplicate a form of templates or something I think if there's also that notion I might just have to do it in notion so I told her that up so I thought about that and I think once I because I make the theory and I should run it through once just really quick I should just fucking perform it that's my biggest situation I need to perform it but I need to be perfect Didn't be as romantic further or something which needs to be fast you and when they reached a stop in part told me what to say I hit that right as blocked thing I need to understand that there will be a resource for that if I don't have the resource I need to find it or several and see if it resource works and Then You Know Go from there I do have that troubleshooting guide now Don't Know I won't worry about intertext or anything Right Now Better Yeah I think I believe in a text jewel but the layering is doing it concept however I realize it is a very like advanced and let's say state-of-the-art method of application when it comes to narrative I need to establish everything else before that and I feel like patterns also is on that higher tier level of understanding and performance I wave above and beyond like fucking not just a Navy seal but fucking seal thing 6 text shit that's a seal team 6 but fucking Chris Kyle type shit anyway how's that at

- Alright let's see 89 on the way to get some food to hopefully I have Vicky knot you know bailout me hopefully gotta make some drum ballaya indecent retail therapy wrote quite well it's been a rough meeting with databasically the I'm no idea what I'm doing I I can think salvage what from this experiment is maybe not a database right now but what I can do as I've Created a message I can take the e database concepts that I have and then use them as passes when I let's see close read or close contacts a book or a close reader what are you going to do close analyze a piece media of I can also use let's see here I really like near the book narrative designs Message of concise and sort of organized close reading is able to really but he breaks it apart so I probably I couldn't just format it similar to the way he does you're in terms of just we're processing I really just don't but I'm not The Thing in Roxette I do want my notes and logs sec and probably bring it over to rent d or shut down Maybe I could look up what latex is maybe I could just format it like a fucking book that be kind of cool like an article and I could release my own publications I'm kind of fun and now this will be I think the whole point is to what is it called points of I was income streams but a profit generators or just if I'm not like if I can I'll take this sort of Study of you know analyzing something I saw why didn'tte analysis or whatever and I'll turn it into all not just do the analysis I'll take it a step further and I'll make it a version of a nutrient product I like the idea because I'm learning to use At the same time on
