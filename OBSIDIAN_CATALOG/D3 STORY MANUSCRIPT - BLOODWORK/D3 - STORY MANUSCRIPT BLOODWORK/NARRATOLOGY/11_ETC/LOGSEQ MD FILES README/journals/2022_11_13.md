- I only cheat 24 I've been awhile since I've finished absolutely everything on theme I've now separate a theme into the sort of different components of definition defining what types of like the medical information it is that helps me out a little bit better understanding of that theme and itself can embody almost any type of narrative device you can put theme in it it's like fucking salt When it comes to cooking it's so necessary it's needed otherwise it's no flavor it has nothing I think that's why how I have to think about Softens out each one you like each of the noodle flavor but think gives it flavor as well you know I know I think I'm going to go to farther that I'm a primary dilemma right now it was like I was able to take the human apply it to some character stuff I'm a little blind to some the plot stuff that I know a lot of work that I've already do religion and theme work so well together and I think that's really dramatic themes and a estimated characters And dualism all the suffer of the research that I did last year actually a game to fruition and it really helped out my whole idea is that my whole dilemma right now is do I go wider or do I get more finite right when I do I get a problem understanding of what story is or do I go in the character no like I got this consistent like battle of Do I segment and silo these parts or did I keep them as whole as one thing and if I'm like the new watches of where the boundaries of 1 end and 1 begins and The Choice that happened to make that without having a real idea about it no the mind and the kind type of I remember watching a video about there's 2 types of Sectors of specialization or or just ideas or concepts like they're either kind or their wicked and kind ways of learning like it's easy to learn math because it's very it's kind it's it's it's it's it's it's it's very kind it's it's it's it's we need it's to learn it's next it's and so it's on and so very forth kind that it's a lot it's of it is it's just information it's that's it's it's it's it's it's it's laid it's out it's it's very easy to get those concepts down once I'm in his wicked I said you can't even trust the book or the people who's claim to be experts And right now and I'm not I'm in a very wicked phase I'm learning very different from what I did with with all those books with thematic undertones and it's in a tough tough to I think I've got to think it's kind of like a rock for me all the stuff that I read from Bloom and I just am afraid of that rock kind of getting swept away by somebody else saying something that also makes sense even more I should have let it go but then if I let it go and I lose contact stuff in the idea of it Right I guess that's why I wrote down the notes I did come back to the stuff earlier from a year ago about duawesome I think I just need to choose at this point and there's a wicked world man already have stories set up I think a story is such an easy read you know I need to refresh on how I'm gonna read that I have to like look at the exhale contents scan the contents they will contents and then What I'll do is write down each cause see this book is different than theme because it isn't just how the design of the book isn't separate conceptions of what little individual topics are at all kind of has to work together I think that's what stopping me is just understanding that story is a different type of read it's a different book all the concepts being taught work together so I need to disable contacts scand then after that You know right I'll do I think I'll go do what I normally did chapter one and then chapter 2 and then I'll do the highlighting thing well well I I may need have you to to do it 1 chapter at a time although 2 chapters at a time to stop the priorities efficiency as well it's just a balance of it I don't know how to figure out how does the how do these cheap tutorials interact yeah I don't have know to do it so far so forth and I think he does that in the book as well I killed bill on top of it also When chapter at a time scan the books scan the table contents that's what I'll do I'm gonna tell a story and then I'll back to that that's about it see you
