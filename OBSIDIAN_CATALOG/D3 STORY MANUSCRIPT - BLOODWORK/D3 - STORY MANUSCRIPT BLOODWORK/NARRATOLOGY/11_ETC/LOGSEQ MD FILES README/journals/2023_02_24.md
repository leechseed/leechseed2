- # How is character defined in several academic fields
	- The definition of "character" can vary across different academic fields. Here are some examples:
	- Psychology: In psychology, character refers to the combination of qualities and traits that define an individual's personality. This includes their values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.
	- **Literature**: In literature, character refers to the individuals who populate a story or narrative. Characters are often described in terms of their physical appearance, personality traits, and actions.
	- **Philosophy**: In philosophy, character can refer to an individual's moral and ethical principles. This includes their virtues, such as honesty and courage, as well as their vices, such as dishonesty and cowardice.
	- **Sociology**: In sociology, character can refer to the values and beliefs that are shared by members of a particular society or culture. This can include things like work ethic, social norms, and cultural traditions.
	- **Education**: In education, character refers to the development of moral and ethical values in students. This includes teaching and promoting positive behaviors such as responsibility, honesty, and respect for others.
	- **Law**: In law, character can refer to an individual's reputation for honesty and trustworthiness. Character evidence may be introduced in court to demonstrate an individual's character in support of a particular argument.
	    
	  Overall, the definition of character can vary depending on the academic field and context in which it is being used.
