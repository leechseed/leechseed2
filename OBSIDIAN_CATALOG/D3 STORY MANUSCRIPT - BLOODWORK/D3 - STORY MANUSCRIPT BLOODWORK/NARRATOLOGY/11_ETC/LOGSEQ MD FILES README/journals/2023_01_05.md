- 8039 Thursday should I need my slides this should be the last day of doing the voga bass after that I think I'm just gonna make a glossary at thetend maybe no I probably just keep it at that you know it was probably fine but a lot I've been making a lot of influences and regards to how I can apply a lot of this shit to what I am like Really you're talking about I think what I'll do is I'll take this vocab pass and I'll do like an in front of us we'll all like go in and like on unformatted bullets that are highlightedid like on the bear outside of like the chapter headings whatever the highest point is and I will divide my thoughts and ideas for each one and after that I'll go back again I'll do the same thing and I will drink it and make it look nice and pretty then after that I will send next action that is a crucial transitional bridge grunchy and transitional stuff that I need to start applying it to other knowledge that already have background noise or Ah what's the difference between background knowledge and fuck there's background knowledge And there is uh whatever I don't know it's like shit life experience myself that's not a knowledge bring those 2 types that's all bring it all together so after I do that the interventional run and they're in front of clean up and then hes unfrench to clean up to apply to other books the other things I think we'll do when I do that infractional influence and the clean up all kind of take it under certain I put it under certain book headings books and book any books and then that's how I'll do the same pass with everything else that I'm doing so this is a very I guess the biggest point I want to make is that this is what this does is a whole experience what it's taught me and probably one of the biggest I'm not a fucking Eureka moment I guess again I'm a fucking genius There are certain parts of the learning process that are not to process it's almost phenomenological phenomenon you can observe it take on notes and sort of improve the phenomenon or adjust it no way but to take it down to brass taxes step 1 step 2 that's what makes the process so wicked and fascinating not also fascinating but unique the human and you can sing if I'm a brand I guess in my style as a writer It's a phenomenal logical process now to understand it I think it's part of the process and too sort of attempt to manipulate it until it doesn't mean that doesn't mean you stop learning you know because I don't know it's like a black Box there are inputs and there are moments where you know these inputs definitely affect the outcome almost certainly and it's N that fact that is is a a never a process it's kind of a curse that right And I feel like that's another binary thematically it's process and phenomenon someone who is calculating something that is calculated engineered design and something that is magic and that indescribable sublime write the genius and the sublime genius of the blind when you think of genius you think of United appropriathe Vinci the car is also a genius but I think that different terms right and then That's besides the point da Vinci and away is genius because of the evidence of that fact that the note says paintings are like jazz the caprio is a genius and his performance what seems phenomenological phenomenon it's happened stands a think and I think that's what makes creative arts so wicked a lot of people where they feel in their creativity they feel that they feel they realize That there phenomenon of phenomenon of the artist rendered creativity highly depends on there the input you'll have your life in books and all that jazz but sometimes you need to understand what your life is sometimes you need to understand and to learn what other people think life is are in your life and just put it in the terms of the knowledge just to see the design knowledge that dynamics dub genius into the genius for the phenomen or any of the genius for the sublime for the supply beneath a genius I need both and far so often I think humanity falls into 1 of 2 camps always 1 of 21 or the other it is only when we rise above those 2 binary options that you find something truly unique and creative the other the 3rd and people will try and categorize into a 3rd option needed independent or whatever and what not but I think that's just a miscalled reservation or a misinterpretation of the idea what genius is the 3rd is like a 3rd eye opening only said wow I'm gonna send But that's the plan I think the biggest thing what to do next is to apply that but I have a lot of lots of stuff I learned in chapter 8 it's OK so what I need to do is 1st apply what I've learned here and apply it to stuff I've quite a bit already read so fucking nerd of design 15 bucks blown but I mean that shouldn't be too hard I think I was gonna do the categorization between subtextual themes service and level themes and a inference theme I think that's something like the American dream right that's an influential theme because everyone has their own concept of the American dream and perential and the thing is that my God damn it's all 3 right shit it but it has to be polar towards one direction Anyway I'm getting way too fucking in the sauce right now but that's a plan based
