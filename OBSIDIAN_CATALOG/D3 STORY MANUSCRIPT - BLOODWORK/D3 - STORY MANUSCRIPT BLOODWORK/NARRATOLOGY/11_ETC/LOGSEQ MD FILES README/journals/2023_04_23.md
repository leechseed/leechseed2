- We need to see it's 67 been working on is actually very physical space bending type work I feel like I've progressed enough in the actual philosophy and a sort of construction of the work that it was time to sort of pull out a little bit and recon technologize everything to a certain degree right One thing is we I moved everything physical or the plan is to do a very thing of physical importance in terms of project of lucid into the office and consolidation of all material I've gotten brought some books and a lot of your books and sites right and I think the goal there is to 1st it's just an organization of everything that have a place for everything that way it has a lot more control than a lot less chaos right I think that's the biggest thing now is that Now that I understand what I'm doing the chaotic nature that the pure chaotic nature of tripping around in the void isn't I think we're necessary at this point or I could do it in the control environment where I don't really need the efficiency now but it's you know like playing fucking Victoria man you know already have the entire bus set up no need to be going around with the pick ax anymore Can be more efficient than these small processes into bigger ones how to get that spaceship off this play on it so so what we're doing is that setting up when did you get all the books set up all the hardware setup I got just want to move everything that is in the book off the bookshelves and put it into that closet area I mean for the books on the shelves After that work on the digital consolidation consolidation EGO I create a server using my brother's all of PC and hes in the hard drives that are extra that I have landed around I still go at least how I'm gonna do that I just think it's gonna take a lot of work I do have an external hard drive too it's gonna take a minute to figure out how the fuck I'm gonna do that I think the 1st either I figured the biggest thing is just don't worry about organizing it but just Worry about making it all fit and dolphin would just do it for a superficial pass of what is really important and then consolidate on that point and after that I think the goal is to put sort of non non crucial assets in which I work are just stuff that I am collecting on the sale they're dealing directly with what I'm working on on to that server and free app All the hard displays on my main PC in that way I also have the backup and also have it accessible and also it will free me up to collect data and create you know at least with the future processes and projects I will want to have builds and experiment with data sets and creating models in stable diffusion and such so that will anyone need to do that and also I'm up and now it's basically for the resources at this point that I can utilize does I realize that I have a lot of really good you know hardware and equipment That I can leverage very easily if I wanted to I seem to you know do it in a sustainable manner that's also implemented into the whole process and you know testing and seeing if it's actually worth putting it but I also wanted to do a system for why does goddamn or what do you call it dictating that isn't on my phone perhaps a way another way of what is it called it a method of understanding I want to hook up a microphone it's really cheap why not one on my 1 of my desk but just a handheld 1 and use that as a mic to discern of and the prop of the Mike to help me paste and then record as well and I'll have some sort of spite now speech a text lot for I can use findings and chat GBT and thopefully all that's happening I can then prepare to pivot to ingesting the heart of the app Physical copies of good data I think you're can parsh the wit by hand actually 1st and then what is it called clean that data up and then you know maybe use folders to separate INS are dictate how I will go to the process of putting things in and through through the system of ingestion and then either putting them through logs act or finding a way to create a eagle link to it I weigh it somehow inside of it and I'm able to reference it like I can think I can have an online repository for it And then link to whatever I need to link to in the lock sec not waiting to it like that rather than other methods already there's some sort of Oracle and make another just I can just do another get and create a device that way or to have the rough hours Uploaded shouldn't be too much of a problem no I can even know AOTR and it's completely transformed on into text into one of all the ways God you know standard text files And then you know just linked to the database word it is rather than actually what we page by Tom ogle Joe is pulling in with the Taco Bell sauce and yes about it
