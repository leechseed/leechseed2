- Meet she 25 I found the patterns of the way McKee talks in story are the way he writes it's the 1st promise in a license as his whole solution really keys end up the way he actually teaches how stor yes you know what hes teaching hes grand ways these grand ideas of how things are principles inspenciples and he lives through the examples right and i think it's a strength and a weakness to a writing personally i think for me it's a strength right now because I'm out the process of material a lot faster I want to double my efficiency from 16 pages per Sprint 232 pages Sprint that are automatically cut back on how much time I'm actually spending on consuming this knowledge on top of that I have this concept of keying in or locking in this idea of how I can be so distracted the way I think even when on adderall I tend to default at a really wide space of thinking But when I tend to find someone that stimulates me I tend to ride that train it becomes a train and it's momentum and it's just like I can't stop I gotta hold of things really deep in do it you know that's just like a you know a superpower that's just not trained to the train it's funny anyway so the whole idea is to 1st find ways to it's things that's fucking easy I'm not gonna put it way around it it's easy to key in tolock in I just need to know what I'm off the rails and get myself back on Because I'll find myself wondering I'm not enough waiting to think I want to do because I want to take a break things want to take a break at 10:30 no it's just a not a portable derailer but I tend to take another track right at 1 of those folks in the intersection well I'm intersection but you know whatever but I also need to fork back on to the track that's the problem I'm going somewhere else different completely and I think the mindfulness that's a reminder for this place and I need to get myself back on track is that what is the rollest these terms come from track train rails It will be on rails it's really interesting anyway back to McKee I think hes a weakness of this God dsenses tendt upon defecate for so long they he separates them in the paragraphs right but so many times I just want him to get to the point because it'll talk about these movies that I've never seen before never intend to or I'd or like in this movie this happens and then this happens see like that as I wish there was a better way for him to translate his example Like if you get a submit a completely fictional existence right but I guess the whole idea of the movies is that you can go watch it later and it's something that will apply to this being kind of a universal thing but what I think is OK men I think hes a little bit narcissistic in the sense that this is something that um that's kind of this ethereal mentor like position like you eat it leans more into movies than he does literature literature lucky has like 10 books at the end buddy sites and not some of them aren't even like Like primary sources they're like how to write a novel like that's not a fucking like what what are the concepts based behind how to write a novel right toward the leading authorities of that type of creativity like everyone like aerosol said something like this is how creativity works right and this is a process of it primary resource not my fucking blog post on paper anyway It's like complaining that a forest trail is tight me entering and you don't really know where it's going God damn it labyrinth is complaining that a met labyrinth is maize like a nature and it's almost like slog a but at the end of the day it's better to have a path to the center to the temple rather than being stuck in a maze with multiple exits with no real clear And go where it exit the difference between amazing labyrinth Alabama has a center and a goal I guess I owe thated a labyrinth but a point along the way are keys and pieces of information tools that I can use to get to the temple oh no more about my super power At the end of the day I think I want to get like a real lock like one of those Americans aren't locked picking but it's kind of cool like a locked picking can't unlock but anyway at the key end I'll walk it 1 night but I can't I use a key to key out I'll pick the lock I'll be so cool I should be in the story anyway I'm getting that's it oh yeah I need to mention what I'm doing next continuing to go through mckay 32 pages today I don't even know what I did where I started having to find that out but 32 pages are run maybe 3 months A-day lock in nigga
