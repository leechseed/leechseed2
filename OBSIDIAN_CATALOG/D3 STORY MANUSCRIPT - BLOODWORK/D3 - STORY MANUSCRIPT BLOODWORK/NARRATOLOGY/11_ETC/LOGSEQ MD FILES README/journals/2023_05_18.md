- Alright let's see it 76 executive executive IP develi meant what that is is I created the world in the story on my TV show or AA game a book or a serit is I create the world of it and then I sell it to a writer to developer 2A whatever right executive IP development No what I can do for my 1st project to prove that there is a place where I guess as I can the 1st thing I want to do was create a tabletop RPG game based entirely on the most populer table top RBG system will agency Libby D and D5V or Pathfinder The 1st one is going to be callet's see yeah it's going to be 5555 did you isn't play dare fare and play my dear fair so I'm so lame no dear park dear world that's not my dare world deer park deer park the reason is leading to this cause I just live to be spent the last 5 hours writing I wrote Which felt great yeah I just felt it's not really good I was just going going and there was a depth I had the main sword but then I deviated onto another line and I kept going and I think what's great about this sort of a it's total almost like psych was it networked Immediately me the light growth I'll just go off in that run direction to eat this and it will become bigger maybe we'll go in another directiono I think the whole idea would be to continue to expand on all this just to continue to build bill bill built build get all that shit together and um I think I don't sell it what I can do is I can How somebody help ride it with me and then I can go and create a lot of design backups for someone to illustrate it for me and then I can go make the game myself and I'll push it like that I'll create the book and I'll do everything I really do think this is just a very good direction to go in in terms of proven there is interest in it right No what that does at least is I guess the next step would be to to make another update you are pretty right I think I really just needed to make it right work on the world itself right now I'm in the development stages of the IP itself not even gotten into the idea of the game but I think I can represent reference the that's saber punk red manual And just that right in terms of the law and the systems let's see here of course I have all the other books I don't want to create a custom system when it comes to the RPG system that I just need to make the IP for the story and I guess oh no no not the story I will have the story the 1st story is the God the kid of She'll Louie a ton's lot cooler he'll no no Hugh Louis Louis huglet me hear Louis Hugh Howie Louie alright alright yeah it'll be told from the perspective of that kid That will be the narrative the main narrative but the thing is that you can see here the whole IP is expensit is shoot the directions we can take this site I think what this is that almost feels like a story engine not a story engine but an IP engine right I'm a 19 engineer My engineering exactby peanut jewelry executive I peel the PM sun live IP design we're in AIP development house I'm a executive IP developer

- We'd seed 75 what happened today what's the to the points got 3 courtboards was able to set up the crab cycle set up deer park and was able to find the 4 points of the crab circle the crab's one that's a real time to the animation AI to which of you are in the top RPG simulator What's interesting with this is you think I can go really really precise with this with my biaudience business wise I can target this towards kitchen kids to watch dreams I guess the whole idea is that it's supposed to be AI wan to call dad this is how does the summer ethical basically I want a Dungeon Master and it's going to be like a 1 on 1 live show I guess you get from like a chatter bait person And accept them doing a show for you you're literally doing a basically a tabletop RPG with Adm in the world of deer park and then they reply back I think of let's see I think of a lot I think a lot of wow I'm kinda tired I'm reminded a lot of the sort of entertainment I get from watching What's called Nero summer AI the interaction with vital I feel like ultimately I would like that type of interaction for the tabletop RPGI think it's definitely fucking possible and when people say chat it with you 4 won't be a good damn it's because they don't know how to make a good AI basically it was difficult part is learning To create how the interaction between the data set the translation the retranslation the type of AI want to use and then how would it train it properly with a definitely want to do some sort of English stick tritra to programming are very similar to chat GBT buthere's a lot of weird idiot thinkers to do when it comes to with the cold Player testing turns off what to say when things are breaking and what not and maybe what I can do is reference a lot of open source stuff I'm good and the hugging face to see how that goes thinking maps I can't really help me today just the finding in Khan however it came up with this like pinterest is actually a really good source for shit I just hate how they monetize it just click on the referral link and you just meant to just want the fucking picture Let's see herethough discombining thinking maps plus the crab cycle creativity I'm able to really conceptualize and innovative product in a way is what I guess what I mean to say when I want to create something revolutionary that will change the world in 15 years or whatever this is sort of that direal time 3-D animation I feel like it's really in the most rudimental form of Animation like minimum viable product would be making it would be to create AGPT problem object but are not DE jibba Willie Collin 3-D what do the ease up program to make the fucking Shiloh shit I'll just do that myself Africa time let's all really coming together because now I have this sort of Defining this whole idea of scope in this crab cycle I'll try define my issue here or what I want to do I take out fucking massive bored of project management I can't there's a lot I just kinda really excessive excessive shit shit this is really what scope is right here You're gonna be able to do with this I can really skip a lot of the scheduling she a lot of this stuff with the project management is that PM IPM P is that there's a lot of views known variables data objects that need to be defined but there isn't And so you I guess that's where the whole idea of agile comes along the problem and agile is that it's the whole idea that it is minimum it's maximizing innovation while minimizing waste but the thing is I think the inherent nature of something truly unique I'll also being utilitarian profitable is that to get there there's a lot of waste In general especially with the 1st time remembering it I guess it's just inherently part of its nature because you're taking you're trying to figure out what something is and you have to let take it apart prepare to watch it I like you're completely assimilating it or not looking like it the whole idea is that you're consuming it and spinning it out scope wise what I'm doing here with the narrative this would be fitting into the TTRBG but then I can what's cool about this whole scope thing Like and then rescopebut you have like a subscope of A-scope right but instead of having these 4 requirements of art science design engi mean I will have 4 let's see you know I could just use for general generalized contextual concepts concepts that help define the whole of that is AI right what are the 4 You know part of AI that I really need to figure you know what it means it's helping me contextualize which is probably the I realized that was my biggest problem it's contextualizing everything but what I think that problem I've had before is that all these narrative books shit it's all just abstractions of wabagon and feel good and protected value and performative value and bullshit and then I feel like that's what people just repeat over and over again but that actually begin to meet and when you throw almost often too late to be realized The real meat is there found for free with a lot of waste like a lot of time actually truly understanding it or not just paying 20 bucks for a shit book paying 8090 bucks for a journal and that's about it
