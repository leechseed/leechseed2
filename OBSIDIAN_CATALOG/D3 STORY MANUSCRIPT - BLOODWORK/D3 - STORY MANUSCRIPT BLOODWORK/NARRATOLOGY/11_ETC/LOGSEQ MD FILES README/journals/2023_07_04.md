- # Trauma and Virtue mechanic
	- ## Each Hero in OxO possess a unique developmental character variable called their *psychosocial ratio*
		- The ratio is between trauma:virtue
		- Trauma is the sustained assault of psychotic violence by *wrathful ekoes* of past ruination. Trauma is  a chronic rhythmic condition. The pain comes in waves keeping the hero in perpetual state of alertness and agitation. Left untreated, it can develop into a *self-destructive psychosis* slowly consumes the host until they either kill someone or themselves. We measure the advancement of trauma using the *spectraumeter*
		- Virtue is shameless vulnerability and righteous strength. Virtue is temporary  respite in the advancement of *spectrammic pain*
		- **A comparative mechanic pattern can be taken from State of Decay 2**
