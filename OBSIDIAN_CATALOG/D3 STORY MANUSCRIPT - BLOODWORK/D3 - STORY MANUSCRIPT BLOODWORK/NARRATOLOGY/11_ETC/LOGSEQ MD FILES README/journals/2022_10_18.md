- Alright we'll see 19 here we go can take a hit real quick OK so one thing I really want to start doing is for a big huge sort of tactical moves where I'm deciding what I want to do for the next couple of days or the next move in my career or whatever I need to take a whole day to think about it and that's basically what I've done too many often too many times I've just been pulled in 1 direction and just go boom and it ends up being Not citizens basically parents remember what put me on this journey in the 1st place is patients discipline and and humility I know nothing so I must learn as much as I can I like to think of myself as NASA when you build a rocket ship to the moon you can't really fuck up how mean you can but it's such a complicated process look at the process something about it I guess what I want to say is that if I'm going to put an astronaut on that thing far that astronaut I'd hope somebody knows what every fucking thing doesn't this at least someone who knows you know someone or someone who can either somebody in control control I don't like the idea of feeling like I'm out of control anymore not when it comes to writing writing cause I know what that feeling is like in the weeds in the kitchen it's miserable it's horrible and you can only last so long I need to take the time to become a chef that's basically what it is my 1st point which I just did the 15 billion theme books does roll about theme And I started going by author I decided for this next Spring I picked out 11 books there's 11 books are what's gonna be for my next brand I only chose 11 70 50 because these books are pretty dense if not I can always add more right this whole Sprint is about myth theme I've and gotten myth I feel like I've got a grasp on the esoteric or the fucking either either that which all this exists and that's a good start Then I could start going into whatever else the media wanna go into I guess I want to base a lot of my research on literature religion with treachereligious literature Bloom and Campbell I guess if I could find a 3rd guy that would be great yes or no that's all I really know with the modern literary I don't know what I can and Rosie I will say where's Campbell scample is hold model meth Never been on there no they're I believe hes misunderstood when he says mono myth it's not the same thing over and over again it's just patterns that in theme that and theme theme is essential to myth and now I can combine those 2 together and the background would be to try and I guess right in my own word along with one book maybe A-day I'll also do a review book A-day of 1 of the themes and like Kind of right on my own notes notes I guess on it in my own pacifications pontifications that you take 11 dictate 11 days date maybe a little bit longer 2 weeks again a week's again 2015 days and a probably a month and a 1/2 I'm gonna have remind me to figure out what I need to do after that I won't really muwhat would know really know much do I read more But generally speaking I think are probably going to each thing individually each literally device independently like do with theme understand what people do with that that's pretty basic right pretty easy and then after that probably looking too Short stories are fast fiction books and then short fiction chin and then my dear for the novel right so I just want not just one Bible it's all universe right anyway I know that's about you've it got to buy it please
