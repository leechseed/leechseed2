- I'll eat shit that you want here I've got somebody from cliff today got some ideas figure I'm actually pretty fluent enough with AI phone enough so the next step is to go back to storytelling and writing and framing and painting so after reading the world of sapperpunk 2077 and the world of division 2 I've realized that what these books provide is a really good Nose to the ground contextualized sort of overview of the world just like I really good template for what builds a world and what I really like about this is that cyberpunk kind of focuses on a city one city within the world a built context around itself while division 2 built a soft around more of an event that's happened and contextualizes around that event of the green poison And it's very interesting is that it's always just like a central point at the sort of hub to the spokes of the world either it's an event a city like to choose one of these things right within the there elaborate sort of list of characters weapons and all that jazz there's 1 thing that kind of like hold it all together the concept I have this idea of wanting to use that sort of hub and spoke sort of mentality like a controlling nature to it and that is for what defines certain story worlds are a sorry I peace that then fit within the contact of what I'm creating So I have this idea that there's always a wide the widest the whitest lens what is the widest frame the biggest frame that I can contectualize everything and and I think the way I have sort of understand it is like there's like several concepts in the widest frame there is theme and SIM will always be like at every single level it's like time itself right theme was present in everything it's the esoteric sort of nothingness that kind of pines everything together there's seen there's a static Then there is feel and the there's time so when you sort of take that into perspective it's it's it's say it's what is it about humans when they 1st dropped themselves into a situation that I don't know it's just like you know where when am I you know those are the theaters of the bottom 3 with the top the theme is a sort of designer's perspective that the idea that this is a Olive it is in is under control of some greater force like God like um And it sort of what it does is it allows the other principles to be able to be flushed out in a way that's contextualized to the eyes and and each of these things have meaning right another concept I want to introduce is the idea of the left in the right brain from a long time ago what I've learned I've realized that using that incorrelation to the idea of humanity and context when it comes to really good stories the idea of dualism humanity in context and left and right so I find my flow what I think in the primary zone of humanity right the idea that I can get very personal with these people in very and touch with these people right but what makes these people so unique is where is the context in which they live in right and that's what really flushes them out That humanity in familiar yet strange places it's it's the 2 things that are really like about story is a cow you have a like how you can be dropped anywhere in time but you can find the humanity and everyone and the struggles are similar and yet what keeps the world so it would keep people as attention and what makes people keep reading what keeps people interesting the story as a context that keeps building around it the strange The obstacles are getting it in the way of these people and echo keeps the humanity keeps the story grounded while the context keeps it creative and imaginative right the humanity needs to be the rock solid connection that keeps peoples that keeps people believing in it and I feel like that is a strength that I have it said that I can hang on to that believability and then I could go wild with the context Whatever it is and I think I'm gonna incorporate that into that sort of wide view of everything right so I'll split each one of those core concepts of the widest lens into 2 different areas right there's to going be the elbow and arm mode or there's gonna be humanity in context humanity we'll be the? That'll be whatever I put in there that's what the humanity's gonna be that's a creativity that's what it makes it human right and then the 2nd part will be the context that part is the right side of the brain that part is the AI part that's the part I'm gonna use My tools to sort of rain in the context and sort of create this format for the humanity to run wild in and I think that's really cool and when you have this widest length set up I think we can then like grab another ones and focal focus in on to what the next thing is right and so this idea of the widest lens is the standard right so when you have this standard of the widest lines you then have the camera yes of the concept right So when I say that I think it incorporates I want to incorporate the studies of literature right these perspectives of literature of we know feminism of modernism all this stuff so we'll take the widest lens and then we'll take the camera off feminism and then we'll look at it from that and angle and that sort of will define the rest of the whatever is coming next after that we had 8 minutes pretty quick about it
- # The class of main character
	- Meant to symbolize the millennial, 'retch' 'tramps' and 'vandals' are the class of individuals who players will start as.
	- Big dreams, big risks.
	- Blamed by the older generation for the degradation of society
	- Blamed by the younger generation for handing them trash
	- Aged 18-38
	- Trauma
		- Promised the world by the older generation, but when their own mistakes ruins economies, they blame the vandals for the decline.
		- Vandals are ones who don't trust easily, even each other
		- What results are personalities that are primarily created to shield vulnerability and attack weakness
	- Success is not defined by vulnerable intentions and listening to the heart, success is defined by materialistic goals that can be used to shore up personality defenses.
	- Vision and purpose is driven by grand acts of revenge, vengeance, and domination
	- Power is wielded by those who are able to command authority of other individuals.
	- However, this does not necessitate weakness of subordinates.
	- Members of this society kind are conniving and calculating, holding their cards close to their chest waiting for the opportune moment to challenge authority.
	- The core tenant of each vandal is their outrageous dream and vision in life and their unrelenting pursuit of that impossible goal.
	- A goal that is meant to either tear down the authority which scapegoats them for issues of society that have been brewing for generations
	- Or to subjugate the youth for their rebellious and disrespectful nature
	- There are two moral classes to the vandals
		- Virtue (Angels)
		- Wrath (Demons)
	- Marked for their heresy, each vandal walks a life driven not by personal aspirations but by the state of society around them.
	- Each vandal's goal is determined either to punish the society that unjustly marked them as exiles or to prove wrong the wielders of judgement.
	- In the end, both are necessary for the reclamation of society. The demons to punish and remove them from the mortal realm and the angels to reconstruct a more just society from the ashes of the old.
	- However, angels and demons are forever at odds, difficult to understand each other's motives they often find themselves tragically at each others throats rather than working together to attack the Gods that damned them.
	- While the demons want an apocalypse the angels want a rapture, will they be able to manifest a real change  in that of revolution?
	- ## GPT 4 summary
		- The main character class, termed as 'retch,' 'tramps,' and 'vandals,' is symbolic of the millennial generation. Aged 18-38, they are blamed by both older and younger generations for societal degradation and the handing down of a damaged world. Traumatized by broken promises and societal expectations, their trust is hard to earn, and they tend to cultivate personalities that protect their vulnerabilities while attacking perceived weakness.
		- Their definition of success is oriented towards materialistic achievements used as shields for their personality, and their driving forces are grand acts of revenge, vengeance, and domination. Power dynamics within this group are complex, with authority being held by those commanding others but not necessarily indicating the weakness of subordinates.
		- Each individual harbors an outrageous, nearly impossible dream, often aimed at dismantling the authority blaming them for societal issues or reining in the rebellious youth. There's a moral dichotomy within the class, divided into 'Angels' symbolizing virtue and 'Demons' symbolizing wrath. Their actions are not driven by personal aspirations, but by the state of society around them, with a goal either to penalize society for their unjust ostracism or to prove their judges wrong.
		- Both angels and demons serve as necessary elements in reshaping society, with the former aiming to build a just society from the ashes of the old one, and the latter seeking to purge those deemed responsible for societal decline. However, their differing visions often put them at odds, with demons seeking an apocalypse and angels desiring a rapture. The key question is whether they can reconcile their differences and instigate a true societal revolution.
