- Alright let's see you at 62 back on the track so oh a lot of productivity today added a lot of testing out this new concept of adding on to these sort of micro habits and behaviors that I've been doing and using that to-do list which actually helps also been adding a timer to my dosing which actually hes my mind up a lot because then I don't think about it at all no matter fully pursue whatever I'm doing are that's probably the biggest A fact that I had like wow multiply this 3 by 5 strategy of 5 or 5 hour blocks of worki feel like I can strengthen myself more and it comes to doing it I definitely see myself fucking like getting real fatigued though at 2nd 5 hour block I think it's because at 1st 5 hour block I just gained instead of Working and I think what I can do perhaps next time is still a 5 hour block of working and then gaming and then when a 5 Bower or just oh hes been at least instead of hard focusing one large project and that 5 hour block I can learn to I mean like explain back in this later like the exercise of muscle love Using the Ace like making up strategic decision to switch to another operation another thing I added do this is actually a implemented a lot today well wow the whole higher RD of the what levels of war of strategy operations and tactics that's it's changes everything it allows me to sort of separate and function along the lines of compartmentalization includes system operating rather than this whole I guess my old movement of open office type shit I mean open office I mean open workspaces and such so much distraction so much bullshit too much stimulation somatic as another way I want to start using pneumatic oh that's what I'm in created a car cracked the crash card again we created that post it and you and started using the corkboard with the schoor did we just go and then I also posted the divide by 5 test sheet on I think I'm what really galvanized me to be the most productive I think I've been in a year is that I know have a lot of the complexities kind of worked out in my head of leech steed and what I'm really trying to conceptualize with that and now I'm able to sort of grasp grasp a lot of the vision values and feeling that I have at this and use chat to be T somewhat as a translator and to put that into words And really capture what I'm trying to say and a very non like mind fucking way it's there's so many revolutions that happen this year it's insane I just feel like I went back and looked at some of my 1st entries and locks like it's almost been a year since I'm using it the term Leach seed I've been on this quest and doing all this research and one thing that also really helped me outlike going through a leadership qualities and Checklist and I didn't feel like I was like a list of 50 that I identified tend that really resonated with me and that's sort of identified me as a type of leader that I want to be and how I want to run this thing because I'm going to it on my own when you get to the later stages of moving towards more of a digital type of medium the whole idea of leech seed pro's works that at the end of the day literature and prose are the core it's like the core competency and the Like a acknowledge set that you really need to be proficient and as well as creating your own see here I guess hes a you know computer couldn't in a way it's to create code or like when it's called on top of that release on top of that like a super flush like auditorium did and using that to then CO drones store the engine which for me is Rita Laria radio area and it's really using all of that as a really solid core foundation what I'm trying to do because I feel like that's what a lot of these Filmmakers nowadays they are like caught up in this rat race too early and in a way it's it's a lot of bking with the prolification of media I feel like when you are inspired by the same things by watching all of the same shit that everyone watches because a lot of people consume nowadays like the barrier of the intelligence of the reader is so much grander than it was before so you can have a lot of references that you pull and a lot of sort of manners and the tiny little things that people do when they're mistaken they're making their filmmaking that really exemplified the amateur quality of even professional film work and writing if there's they lean on yes you know when the key said it doesn't sound cliche and I'm not just a general misunderstanding of froze to what they want it's and it's also it's the heart behind it it's and the sacrifice and the dedication and the hard work and the discipline in the vision and a relent less pursuit and the honor of being an artist you know it's about making money it's about putting food on the table it's about pandering so you can survive and that's unfortunately the state of a lot of entertainment media is nowadays like when people are driven to be desperate Decrease shit that's safe which is isn't art it's then of course it's like I don't even know I'm or bored I was sort of a shit media causing shit driving down a culture and then over and then it drags itself down into just this hole and until you get I don't know that fork in the hammer to pull that nail out and to drive it back in with one strike and tell them this is how it had done you have a chance of saving American culture and that's what I'll lead you to it's about That was a Renaissance crusade proceed and yes it's that the pointhat's about it please

	- ### This is the actual prompt
		- Sure, here's an updated prompt that incorporates cyberpunk and sci-fi elements in a less direct way:
		    
		  "Imagine a world where the lines between reality and virtuality have become blurred, and people spend more time living in a digital world than in the physical one. In this world, the urban landscape is dominated by towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets, where the rich and powerful live in luxury and the poor struggle to survive in the ecological wastelands that surround the cities.  
		    
		  You find yourself trapped in a cycle of overstimulated ennui, where the constant barrage of technological stimuli has left you feeling drained and disconnected from the world around you. Despite this, you are still subject to the pressures of your environment, where success is measured by your ability to project a brand-friendly image on social media and other digital platforms.  
		    
		  As you journey through this surreal world, you begin to sense the presence of powerful forces at work, forces that embody the dualistic nature of the universe. You encounter mysterious deities and mythic creatures that hint at a larger cosmic structure, one that is both beautiful and terrifying in its complexity.  
		    
		  Eventually, you discover a hidden portal that leads to a parallel reality, where the laws of physics and nature are inverted. In this surreal world, you see how the struggle between opposing forces takes on a new dimension, one that challenges your assumptions and pushes you beyond your limits.  
		    
		  As you explore this strange new world, you are forced to confront the tension between the seductive power of technological escapism and the need for authentic connection and engagement with the physical world. You begin to question the nature of reality and the human condition, and wonder what it truly means to be alive in a world where the boundaries between the real and the virtual have been blurred beyond recognition."  
		    
		  Based on this prompt, an AI art generator like DALL-E could potentially create a visual representation of the cyberpunk landscape, the mythic creatures, and the hidden portal leading to the parallel reality. The artwork could capture the sense of overstimulated ennui and the blurring of reality and virtuality, while also exploring the themes of dualism and the search for authenticity in a world dominated by technology.

													- That being, Uranium-235 to a Nuclear Powerplant
													- It is a *fusion* nuclear power plant
													- What I have put into Radiolaria has the potential to power a method of prose for generations.
													- Rooted in literature and academia, open source, it, in fact, will be.
													- But like a Nuclear Power Plant, it is not the shit in it that makes it power the world, its the people who run it, and the *one who built the reactor*
												- The Skipper - AKA
													- Me. And whoever is in charge in absence at The Plant
													- The Plant is effectively the physical space in which LSPW Personnel interact with the Strange Container
													- The Skipper, like the captain of a ship, is in charge when on deck.
													- On deck, as in, physically present.
													- IE: The Skipper basically lives there.
													- Prime creator, contact, and communicator with the Strange Container.
													- All Skippers must earn XXX Rating Qualification with the DCV to properly get gaping hole dug out
									- Brand Reputation
									- Knowledge
									- Organizational Culture
										- The Skipper somewhat believes that amongst his immediate peers he is regarded as
											- a poetic, relentless, clever, coomer, a narrative wundermaester.
											- culture that supports behavior that is: genuine,  gracious, empathetic, optimistic, interesting
											- cultural behavior expressed uniquely by the skipper: enthusiastic, witty, supportive, confident,
											- unfortunately, the skipper can manic, cruel, and shameful, judgmental, and dismissive.
											- At worst, the Skipper displays traits of Narcissism, specifically,
												- Grandiose Narcissism: This type of narcissism is characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, an intense need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others.
												- Collective Narcissism: This type of narcissism involves an excessive preoccupation with the perceived greatness or superiority of one's group or community. Individuals with collective narcissism may exhibit an exaggerated sense of group identity, a tendency to devalue those outside the group, and a belief in the inherent superiority of the group.

					- **Evaluate the resources**: Once you have identified the resources, evaluate each resource to determine its strengths and weaknesses. For example, financial resources may include cash reserves, lines of credit, and revenue streams. Evaluate the strength and reliability of each of these resources.
						- **Evaluating the Resources**
							- **Tangible Resources**
								- Value Chain Equipment Resources
								  collapsed:: true
									- Evaluation
										- When it comes to reaching campaign 2 tier goals of generating income through text publication, I am set.
										- In terms of creating a secondary income stream through publication of screen video, audio, or other creative digital products, I am also set for this.
										- Growth, however is an issue. The biggest hurdle is the barrier to entry when it comes to efficient 3D animation is the hardware technology necessary to research, analyze, and create a system that is robust yet lean.
										- General suggestion to overcome this hurdle is to
											- take advantage of the unique equipment resources to leverage creative knowledge content
											- create value chains/funnels that lead to terminates with youtube content
											- avoid complex funnels that incorporate multiple sources of income such as patreon, courses, ebooks, etc.
											- keep the product simple, cast a wide net etc.
											- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING - 2/5^^
								- Intellectual Property Depth and Growth Resources
								  collapsed:: true
									- Enough resources to manufacture the a robust radiolacra
									- Enough research to stress test/refine Strange Maester Bathala
									- The greatest asset for Leechseed is the wealth of already collected data, tests, ideas, etc.
									- The great hurdle is the processing of all the information into a dataset that correlates with the radiolacra/Bathala
									- As if, with anything, time is the greatest hurdle.
									- General suggestion
										- continue to casually document in the logseq journal
										- ULTRAPROSE can funnel data steadily by learning how
											- queries work in logseq
											- using tags to slowly funnel relevant shit into ultraprose
											- i can solve a lot of the digital legwork such as evernote, lost docs, etc thru background researching using chatgpt
											- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING 3/5^^
								- Digital Asset Storage, Access, and Distribution
									- This hardware will be useful in collecting anecdotal digital resources for Strange Maester Bathala
									- Hardware may also be useful for rudimentary 3D video production beyond the radiolaria such as setting up a homelab server or whatnot.
									- however the barrier to entry when it comes to this is fucking knowledge heap.
									- Current Suggestion, not very useful currently. Should disconnect the PC I have plugged in now.
									- Seriously consider a safe method of deep storage for the one franken PC.
									- **I should probably get a cheap case, refirb it, and store it properly.**
									- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING: 4/5^^
									- **A Media Plex Drive, and a method of organizing all the videos, photos, could be a good background experiential existential toe dip into the wild world of homelabs.**
									- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING: 2/5^^
								- General office Operations Equipment
									- Growth for adding a physical stakeholder/partner or physical contract hire or just anything that has to do with meeting physically with up to ideally max 4 people for business is a primo setup.
									- Unless they're not into the coomer aesthetic. In that case that's their problem.
									- General Suggestions
										- **I should create a stakeholder visit protocol whenever I get the chance, basically the necessary steps that must be executed before any sort of collaboration visit with a coomerphobic stakeholder.**
										- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING 1/5^^
								- Lead Pursuit and Mobility
									- Traveling should be considered a priority strength when it comes to planning anything strategic.
									- While cash is not on hand, I do have the availability of family liquidity injection with good reason and a large gap of notification
									- General Suggestion
										- The  great thing holding me back though is the digital integration of synching information. I at least need to create some sort of rudimentary contingency task list, otherwise travel may instead introduce an unnecessary hurdle in transferring data into a dataset for processing at the least opportune time
										- **I'm sure by now there is something that supports multiple user access to one logseq or something. Or, I just need to create another gitrepo system in which i upload/dl git repos for later processing. something like that**
										- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING 4/5^^
								- Personal Composure and Health
									- I think of this as necessary equipment when delving into 3D motion capture.
									- I really want to explore that area to inform a method that empowers both the efficiency and accuracy of motion capture while also enabling stylistic and creative dexterity in traditional/digital roto animating
									- I mean honestly I should just start hopping on that motherfucking rowing machine
									- [[#green]]^^OPS PRIORITY RATING 2/5^^
