	- D&D and Wizards have something called the Open Gaming License in which people are able to use their system as long as they publish under the same license.
	- **Open Game License (OGL)** is the license in which many game systems are published under open source principles.
	- Specifically its done under the System Reference Document of the 3rd Edition.
	- **Systems Reference Document (SRD)** is the core deliverable white paper report that details all the mechanics that make up a gameplay engine
	- I should look into researching one of these engines, perhaps I can build the universe atop one.
