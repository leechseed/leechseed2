	- This shit is sick. For some reason, cyberpunk and the neon aesthetic still hits hard even two years after the release.
	- This music video really illustrates the kinetic, hyperstiumlating, maximal oversaturated nature of cyberpunk.
	- A grotesque display of naked shameless vice.
	- Colors sear your eyelids off
	- the only dark color is black, and its the darkest on the planet.
	- ## Pedestal Camera Frame motif
	- A lot of the action is filmed like a product display from QVC except perverted till its cool af.
		- The subject and action lie at the center of the 3D stage
		- the camera is anchored on sticks running on rails at 180 degree track.
		- In effect, the camera 'orbits' the subject.
		- During these scenes, the camera is locked off with movements being smooth, slow, and intentional.
		- It adds a total designer exhibition vibe to the video, which contrasts well with the psychotic seziure of the rest of the cyberpunk aesthetic.
		- This works well with the Banglenciaga brand aesthetic.

			- the transitional areas seem to be a rough leather
			- the distinct printed material used as loops for the upper shoe laces
				- there is a pattern present, as well as intention with faded red quality
				- the pattern is yellow and blue, rgb
				- perhaps to represent a theme of transition
				- the end of a generation, and the beginning of a revolution
				- Upper printed material has a markedly different textural pattern
				- little tiny dots
				- functional, perhaps due to the top two laces are ment to be the tightest
				- that would suggested the dots act as a structural reinforcement
				- the pattern transitions a quarter of the way through the heel back to the original print pattern.
				- the air jordan logo, looks like the old one, not the one with Jordan dunking, splat in the middle of the abrupt side by side transition.
				- The logo itself is not in the middle, but spliced a third of the way from the left between air and jordan
				- the detail of the symbolism is incredible.
				- reinforces the value of the shoe, beyond the surface level grindset hustle considerations
			- the stitching
				- the photo highlights the stitching of the shoe

				- its the *patterns* which make the shoe unique.
				- its the intent and execution of the faded pattern which create depth in the design.
		- the 'Next Chapter' shoe represents a clear-headed and respectful understanding of the history of Air Jordans. The visual formic design of the original while also incorporating techniques and motifs of the innovative present.
		- These shoes are not meant to close a chapter or say goodbye, it was a vehicle specifically designed for the present and the past  to take the symbolic trip of transition into the  unknown.

- # A commercial of Commander Shepard's favorite store in the citadel.
	- This can be a series.
	- ## Store 1 - Banglenciotics
		- Hi I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite store in the Citadel.
		- Its called Banglenciotics.
		- Have you ever wanted to bang, ok but are too busy chasing down
			- NIHILUS?
			- The covenant from Halo?
			- Metal Gear Solids?
			- or the reapers?
		- Have you gotten to the end of the universe and wished you had banged more?
		- Did they not have a bang flavor you liked?
		- Did you save the universe only to say 'fuck it, I'm out' and realized too late that the people you're stuck with for the rest of eternity are uncanny inhuman replicants and its too late to turn back now because you've been at mass effect speed for two hours already?
		- Did you never get a chance to actually 'bang, ok?'
		- Was that not an option?
		- Regret no more, Commander Shepard! That's why Commander Shepard's favorite store in the Citadel is Banglencotics!
		- Well, that's why Banglenciotics is the store for Commander Shepards like me.
		-
		-
		- Well, keep your tentacles
	- 'we'll bang, ok?'
- # Division 2 Wall Street Mission, New York Expansion
	- Memorable level inside the stock exchange.
	- instead of a staircase, there is a wide spiraling walkway that winds a massive open area.
	- In the center is a huge bull bronze statue.
	- The most interesting pattern
		- The firefight that ensues requires me to push a riker shield sniper down the walkway because reinforcements are coming behind me.
		- I'm taking cover, pushing down the spiral.
		- The riker, is at a slightly lower and to the left of me, so he has vision of me and understands what I'm doing, but can't fire back
		- So what ensues is this comedic moment that can be really well illustrated visually with the framing and panning of a camera
	- Why its funny
		- The moment itself is serious.
		- Illustrated that sniper is in the way of progressing downward.
		- But he is tough, and honestly in a better position but in an annoying kind of way.
		- I'll have to take my time to eliminate him.
		- Escalation of stakes. Reinforcements from behind me. Several men. Perhaps a whole squad.
		- Much more of a problem than the sniper.
		- *The dilemma* presents itself.
			- Either the squad behind me flank me off and kill me, or I push the sniper and kills me.
			- I have decide an action between the two. Both are the wrong answer to an impossible question.
		- *The gap opens up* and story is created when
			- I decide to push the sniper.
		- *The drama* is created in how I decide to execute that decision.
			- The slow crawling swivel down this excruciatingly long spiral...
			- A rather absurd method of getting between floors.
			- But this is Wallstreet, and things are done in extravagantly absurd ways. Just look at the bull.
			- Its the apocalypse, there's a dude with a shield and a sniper rifle
			- and I'm not here to trade stocks, I'm here to destroy a warehouse full of weapons.
		- Its this moment, the textual, subtextual, and inferred come together to make a moment that is unique, dramatic, creative, and above all entertaining.
- # Value creation and breadth of universe
	- Perhaps one of the greatest design principles of a wide and deep universe is the potential for creating these dramatic moments.
	- Which, arguably, is the core value of what entertainment is--dramatic moments that are unique enough to be entertaining on multiple levels.
	- But what a deep universe provides is a detailed ruleset that is mutually understood by the creator and the community.
	- When this ruleset is robust, one can create intricate, highly unique circumstances that take advantage of the systemic interactions with the rules and eventually pushing those rules to the limit, then finally a recognition, criticism, and critique of those rules till world itself enters *transition*.
	- There are multiple ways to explore a ruleset or formula as evident in two iconic TV series such as Power Rangers and Pokemon.
	- One has a simple ruleset that is easily mutated while maintaining its own unique identity.
	- Pokemon has a more robust and complex ruleset which makes it less mutable. Its value is expressed differently.
	- Pokemon expresses its value through maintaining its identity as a brand while its community evolves rapidly over time.
	- Pokemon strives to deliver the same iconic entertainment value it did in the 90s to children of now.
