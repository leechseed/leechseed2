- Alright let's see 66 nigger so so what do we have here we have a setup 4 transmitted transmediating our concepts into another medium S know it's just whole idea of meaning and how meaning is it necessarily displayed in one form I've really been so obsessed with this textual idea of display of what meaning is and by that I mean I'm taking a book and then turning into a summarized version that a glossary and then turning into another book which in a way helps me understand better but what I want to do is create meaning that's what I make meeting I have understanding connected to other understandings creating ideas creativity and unique entertaining shit and solutintelligence so I after just a scrape that I'm after Look at all those textbooks yesterday about intermediate bullshit my sort of line of thinking when from Oklahoma let's me just write reports about interviews I'm not OK now done with the report that I need to leave text and then law and behold you know stay about the fusion but working on a little bit it's the idea of intermediating by creating meaning and understanding and really by doing that I'm sort of in a way creating meeting and itself recursively it is the whole meta of it from creating a those normal pathways right I need to know if North pathways and sort of creating a depth chart in terms of how certain concepts connect with other concepts and almost really creates that radio are got a mesh of strong fibruce your logical tissue I guess that's very woven dense and very what is it called robust and it's been a lot you know connective thinking We're going to the dentist today had a really tough dramatic moment again I'm like stuck with this idea of schedule schedule and mine and what not but I just don't want to think about that right now I have all that I need that's basically halfway think what I'll do is I won't say I decided Because I can keep doing research I think what I've decided however is I need to pick a concept book concept and turn it into a series or really studying the medium of an ebook release it on one of the more recent mediums I think what I'll how it seems that all you are the more difficult but I think What really helped me demonstrate my craft craft so to speak not necessari lay my literature prowess but my ability to tell a complex engaging modengaging modern narratit's what I would do when I say I want to write a order for streamers However what's great is that I feel like a lot of the space settled and I'm not really cool about this it's now I can actually make it a. Piece it is huh really good strong boand I'm inter contextuality with that is that I can then set other boundaries of inspiration within that period of time within ti see here we'll set birthdates and everything and so the sort of the inter textural I guess data said we'll be that of that of those said years of those kids being alive I like the idea of 911 taking a part I don't think it's going to play big part maybe I'll affect you to win differently I controlling controlling topos would what do be you I believe it is Something I just no I don't want to know underrunning current of everything nowadays to be sold to being engaged to be fake parasocial alienation and the dream perhaps well Indian nation Jim youth and power alienation Indian nation and oupower and redemption power and punishment power and righteousness it's this idea of a decadence and um Um how quickly it falls yeah I'm going to tell her some that almost seems like a gold rush in the end like it needs that as a reference it will be Dick no I didn't search the white what's your name could be taken to path of huckleberry I'm bored I want that she is a poor one you can't even end up observing the side of that she's in interesting there I think it'll be important to see you understand other literary things that are present
