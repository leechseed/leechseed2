- # GPT research with GPT
	- ## What is NLP AI
		- NLP AI stands for Natural Language Processing Artificial Intelligence. ^^It refers to the use of AI techniques to understand, interpret, and generate human language.^^ ^^NLP AI enables machines to understand and interact with human language in a way that is natural and intuitive to humans.^^
		- NLP AI systems are used in a wide range of applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and speech recognition. ^^These systems use a combination of techniques from linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to analyze and process human language.^^
		- Some of the key components of ^^NLP AI systems include tokenization^^ (breaking down text into individual words or phrases), ^^part-of-speech tagging^^ (identifying the grammatical structure of a sentence), ^^named entity recognition^^ (identifying names of people, places, and organizations), ^^sentiment analysis^^ (determining the emotional tone of a piece of text), and ^^language generation^^ (creating text that sounds natural and coherent).
	- ## What are the components of the NLP AI chatGPT?
		- ChatGPT is a language model based on the GPT architecture, which uses deep learning to generate human-like text responses to input prompts. Here are the main components of ChatGPT:
		- ^^Preprocessing^^: ^^The input text is preprocessed to prepare it for analysis.^^ T^^his includes tasks such as tokenization^^, which involves breaking down the text into individual words or subwords, and ^^normalization^^, which involves converting words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").
		- ^^Transformer Architecture^^: The core of ChatGPT is the transformer architecture, which is a t^^ype of neural network that is particularly effective at processing sequences of text.^^ The transformer architecture ^^allows ChatGPT to generate text that is contextually appropriate and coherent.^^
		- ^^Training Data:^^ ChatGPT is trained on large amounts of text data, such as books, articles, and websites. This training data helps the model learn patterns in human language and develop an understanding of how words and phrases are used in context.
		- ^^Language Generation^^: Once ChatGPT has processed the input text, it generates a response using a language generation algorithm. This algorithm uses the patterns and structures learned during training to create text that is contextually appropriate and natural-sounding.
		- ^^Postprocessing^^: Finally, the output text is postprocessed to ensure that it is grammatically correct and free of errors. This may include tasks such as spell-checking, grammar-checking, and punctuation correction.
	- ## How do I develop and design an NLP AI
		- Developing and designing an NLP AI involves several key steps. Here is a general outline of the process:
		- ^^1. Define the problem:^^ The first step in designing an NLP AI is to define the problem that the AI will solve. This involves identifying the specific task that the AI will perform, such as sentiment analysis, language translation, or chatbot conversation.
		- ^^2. Gather data:^^ Once you have defined the problem, you need to gather data to train the AI. This data should be relevant to the task at hand and should include examples of both positive and negative outcomes.
		- ^^3. Preprocess the data:^^ Before you can use the data to train your NLP AI, you need to preprocess it to clean and prepare it for analysis. This may involve steps like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
		- ^^4. Choose an NLP algorithm:^^ There are many different NLP algorithms to choose from, depending on the specific task you are trying to solve. Some popular NLP algorithms include word embeddings, deep learning, and sequence models.
		- ^^5. Train the AI:^^ Once you have chosen an algorithm, you can use the preprocessed data to train the AI. This involves feeding the data into the algorithm and adjusting the model parameters to optimize performance.
		- ^^6. Test and evaluate the AI:^^ After training the AI, you need to test and evaluate its performance on new data. This involves measuring key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
		- ^^7. Deploy and maintain the AI:^^ Once you are satisfied with the performance of your NLP AI, you can deploy it in a production environment. It is important to continue monitoring and updating the AI to ensure that it continues to perform well over time.
- # Understanding Complex Topics Theory Testing
	- ## Tackling the task of developing a comprehensive understanding of AI enough to begin programming is a challenge that is daunting, exciting, and motivating.
	- I've struggled over the last couple years attempting to understand and codify knowledge that is meaningful and productive towards the goals I have for my career/self.
	- Previous failed attempts have consisted of a pattern of errors in which I repeatedly rose to my incompetence.
	- However, ever since I quit my *shit job* working at Hungry Hitler's, I've been able to focus and meticulously pick apart the failures of my past.
	- I am one to dream. I'm prone to grand delusions. I identify with a man like Walt Disney on a level equal megalomanic delusions of grandeur. But I digress.  We  live in the future.
	- More than ever, more than any other time in the goddamn history of man sex has one been able to simply *query their curiosity* to what limitations set only by that of the user.
	- I digress.
	- Back to the point.
	- ### Multi-Dimensional Solution Design Patterns.
		- In the past, failures have often occurred at the same fuzzy step in an undefined sequence of execution.
			- *EG*: I would begin to write a script, follow the steps written by *Pillar, we all know who it is no reference needed*, and would inevitably fail at the crucial point of actually writing the script.
			- *Analysis*: Fear and the overwhelming sense of shame overpowers logical thinking and the breakdown of the next step of a complex system.
			- *EG*: Pillar Alessandria created a design methodology that was easy to understand until it failed.
			- That point of failure lied in the inexperience of Alessandria's locus of expertise. Clearly she has mastered a design pattern which provides all the components to write a film script.
			- However, the lackluster and rudimentary nature of the presentation of key concepts required to write something of substance...something to be proud of...clearly lacked.
			- I can remember fuckin shiddin myself here several times.
			- Breakdown: **The Dark Mentors of the Wicked Craft of Storytelling are Masters of Not What is Claimed but What is Taught**
		- ### Solution - Analyze Problems from Different Perspectives - Modeled Perspectives which should are easy to implement and empower learning and curiosity rather than fearing it. What a bitch
