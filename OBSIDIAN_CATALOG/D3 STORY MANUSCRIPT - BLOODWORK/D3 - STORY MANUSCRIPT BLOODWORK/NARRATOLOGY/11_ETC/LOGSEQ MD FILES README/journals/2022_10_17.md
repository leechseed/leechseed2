- Alright let's see it 18 congratulations self we did it we did it we finished reading all 15 of Bloom's books paint a blooms Box the 3rd summer a little bit of stuff that we need to do somehow escaping I'd like to go back and make sure all of my titles are correct correct that's something I know I feel like I need to deal with the 1st the 1st 3 and after that 2 maybe extend some of the notes for some of the books in the 1st 3 and then after thand then after that you can discuss what's next Big blue the biggest thing that's next is to once again put everything in my own words I've said this before in the last one I think what others are creating a new graph no link it it and what I'll do is I'll just transport or link all of the "that i like or that I'm going to pontificate on to there After that I'll translate it even more until I have something to work with which is hopefully something I can really add to the thematic formula which honestly is better which honestly is about it it'll be a bit more complicated but I can then take the book from that book who has all the terms terms using literary nonsense and I'll just go again with Bloom and see what he has to say maybe we could just finish up a Bloom and just finish reading what he wrote and then maybe then after that go to I'm Campbell and then you know we'll see where we go from there really I think the thing that do is to find somebody else just as prolefic as blooming camel and it's one more person and I have 3 of those people down and I think it's good to move on and get into more in depth research and writing perhaps I'm very good and pretty solid I wonder how much else to say yeah that's really good I guess maybe but there's a lot more work to do a lot more work for work but this is the 1st time I've ever come in anything I think maybe thing 11 I should do I should write one short story Just to see where I've come from what I wrote the gumtree story and the now T05 come from then I need to read a short story book which got a published prioritize next alright alright
