- Alright this is a leech seed 23 I've been done one of these in a while but what I've done is I have completed reducing each concept of the themes until it was fine I think I possibly can to each 1 of these concepts very small ones the next step is to then take these names conceptualizations a small and organized them in a way that I can them and then apply them 2 to certainarrative devices go thinking I'm having to of having 2 kind of caterpillarized each one of these items and to certain types but I don't think that's necessary because I realize that defining a theme can also be part of a characterization or because that's definitely a part of the writing process whether its incorrector or in the Use of it in what's a nature or the environment or what they're wearing or an events or language like or could be a choice to define it or it could be choice not to definebut then you get that as a choice right I don't want to hear I was thinking about how separating the definition of a theseparates it from being able to be used in The process of the writing which I don't think I know I don't think I'm gonna do that I'm just going to these conceptions and then just put them at the beginning of each one of these like put him back in the original the magic like a theme study that also have a translated version where it's just those that way it's a lot more like easier to read Yeah I'll just have 2 maybe 3 versions of it I'll have the you know thematic outline and that's what I'm really going to be reverenting most and then I'll have it's like the final one and then I'll have the like thematic the thematic page and then I'll have these other things I don't have to like reference the other ones because I can basically part it out I think the next step is just to go back into I wanna see if actually I wanna apply all these things into let's say other forms of writing let's say like the methodological methodological method the way Pilar does it auto apply it to that and I think what it'll do is will help really understand what exactly I'm trying to do you know really apply it to the method cause if anything it's massive a step I think then after that what I'll need to do is somehow somehow visualize all of that I know people do these giant boards I feel like there's a digital way of doing it negative that might not be the best way so um yeah I think that's it
