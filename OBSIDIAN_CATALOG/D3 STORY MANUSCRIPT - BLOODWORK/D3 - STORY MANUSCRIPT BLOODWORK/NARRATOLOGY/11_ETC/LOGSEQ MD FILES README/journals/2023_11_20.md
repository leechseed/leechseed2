- **OK -  tips for noobs that don't want to read a fucking BOOK.up front  **
- First and foremost: There are any number of anal or vaginal training 
  toys and plugs and ideally you should get into a sex shop if you can so   
  you can 'eyeball it' and touch and feel things through the packaging to   
  get an idea of what you are dealing with. **Don't buy your very first toy on amazon.**  
- This article presumes you have already bought yourself a toy or 5 and you know what's what.
- If all you trying to do is train so that your significant other can smash your butt, [A dialator set like this](http://www.amazon.com/Trinity-Vibes-Blue-Anal-Butt/dp/B00973AL8W/ref=pd_sbs_hpc_7)
  which goes to 2.0 -2.5 inches wide or a little more is a good start and  
  PLENTY and ALL YOU NEED for most noobs to train. Add ONE 'cock like'   
  toy that's about the same size they are using or even just a little bit   
  bigger and you're all good.  
  The logic is VERY SIMPLE: Once you can take the plug or toys that is   
  approx the SAME SIZE as your wiener life support system/ dick   
  appointment / toy in the strapon harness - you are (almost) ready.  
- That's right. ALMOST. Just slow your roll, Satan.
- Bear in mind that all your nights of solo playtime experience does 
  not really equate to the real world throwing down with a living   
  breathing fuck machine.  
  So JUST BECAUSE you can take the plug alone and on your own (but it   
  still takes you 'warming up' with some of the smaller ones and it still   
  takes you 10 minutes to get to the big one) does NOT mean you are ready   
  for that first fucking - without it, or with the same amount of warmup.   
  No. You need more.  
- Do not make the mistake of going in cold to your first dick or strapon appointment.
  You have to do the same prep you do and maybe even a little more -   
  especially if it's a kinky scene where you are facedown - assup cuffed   
  to a spreader bar and ballgagged. .  
- Why? I am going to tell you. You will absolutely  CLENCH DAFUQ UP in 
  response to that first penetration that is either too quick (and   
  compared to what you do, it's ALWAYS  too quick unless they are super   
  pro) or the whole rapid BANG BANG BANG right off the bat. Once you   
  clench from fear, **it's all downhill from there.**  
- If your dick appointment is still but a Padawan learner in the ways 
  of the ass force, do not let them run the **ass smash** show right off   
  the bat.  
- NOOB ANAL SEX FOR FIRST TIME BOTTOMS.
- Lay on your sides as if spooning. Whoever is receiving, scootch your 
  butt back into you feel something poking you in teh buttocks, Now GRAB   
  ONTO the weiner/toy  WITH YOUR HAND AND SQUEEZE at the base and now YOU   
  BACK INTO IT.  
- THEY DON'T FUCKING MOVE until you have it fully inserted and have done your 10 count or whatever you do and start rocking on it.
  Once you are out of first gear and release your DEATH GRIP at the   
  base of the wiener ( and this is recommended if it is a living wiener   
  because it keeps them  hard during those first few awkward moments. If   
  they feel themselves starting to go soft, the natural response is what?   
  THRUST. But if you are not ready - that's when the ASS TRAIN leaves the   
  rails. So you squeeze them off at the base and things stay hard enough   
  to git er dun.  
- Once you let them go, that's the signal. TIME TO GET YOUR FUCK ON.
- Then they can go all fucking PORNSTAR RAWR on your ass.
- Of course those that are doing the strapon thing do not need to worry
  about keeping the wood going. You literally have the rest of your life   
  to get it done. So why rush?  
  Once you are able to insert a trainer or toy that is the same size as  
  whatever's coming next in 15-30 seconds or less and **bang away for a 
  solid minute straight at 120 beats per minute** - you are ready to move   
  on.  
- Once you get beyond that you are getting into hardcore Pro/Power 
  Bottom territory and no longer just 'practicing to make it easy for your  
  partner to get all up in you gutz'  
- WHAT ABOUT LUBE?
  If you are newish to doing anal and pushing boundaries - [This is the best stuff for noobs][[https://amzn.to/39K6jBo](https://amzn.to/39K6jBo)]  
- PJUR "Back Door' or 'Analyse Me'.
- I have used all the water based lubes (weak and dry up in a minute) 
  and most of the silicone lubes are very thin and do not coat well so you  
  get a higher friction than is optimal.  
  This stuff is thick, slippery as fuck and has an extra ingredient   
  (jojoba oil) that is a natural relaxant (note: not a painkiller - just a  
  muscle relaxer which is why it's used in massage oil)  
  Apply liberally to yourself inside and out with a finger, small toy   
  or a lube 'syringe' type 'shooter' device and use fingers to spread it   
  around and let it soak in for 10 minutes and then do your normal stretch  
  and warmup - prepare to be surprised. It really does make a difference.  
- For those that are serious about it and have been trying to take that
  toy or your SO for the first time... this is the difference between   
  OOOH and AHHHHHHH.  
- OKAY! That's the short version. For about 99% of you that's enough. You're done.
- Buh bye. Get the fuck outta here before we corrupt your ass. Literally.
- **Looks around** . . . It sure got quiet.  We got rid of all the noobs. Yeah?
- Ok. **Freaks** ready for school? Come the fuck on.
- PREFACE: The first thing you learn when you go from noob to a PRO is how to
- [CLEAN DAT DIRTY FILTHY FUCKING ASS OF YOURS](https://howtocleanyourass.wordpress.com/) <---clicky
  (OK - you NOOBS that didn't run and are still lurking - if I am being completely honest, you ~~should probably~~ **absolutely have to** read this. Nobody likes playing with noobs that DON'T KNOW THIS STUFF.)  
- **SIDE STEP:** FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE BIGTIME CRAMPING ISSUES WHEN CLEANING OUT.
- I ran into a post in one of the groups that took me to this website 
  where a colorectal doctor developed a scientific approach to creating a   
  proper anal douche or enema for sexytime purposes.  
- Apparently he thinks good old water is not good enough and can 
  actually damage you if you are a frequent flier sticking a hose up your   
  ass and using quarts of water or a firehose (aka showershot) to clean   
  out.  
- I have not tried it myself nor can I vouch for it [but a quick read of it](https://futuremethod.com/blogs/the-future-edition/how-to-anal-douche-clean-for-anal-sex) says it might be worth a look if you are a hardcore player and have had prior issues with cramping and such.
- Now, to be completely candid, it sounds like a product in search of a
  problem to fix but I included it here just in case you have been around  
  the block and have had issues and try as you might, can not seem to fix  
  them.  
- Maybe give it a shot and see if you get some relief from what ails 
  ya.  I don't have a promo code or an affiliate link and I make no money   
  on it (or anything else you see and read here or any other link you   
  might click)  
  ANYWAY - YOU FILTHY FUCK - NOW YOU'RE (Somewhat) CLEAN. NOW WHAT?  
- NOW, for those of you who are not beginners and can already take a 
  decent size toy and BE ALL YOU CAN BE and want to work up FAST to take a  
  BIG TOY like BAM, TACALL BLACK BALLED, XL Jumbo Jacks Bad Dragon , Mr   
  Hankey etc or even a fist or DOUBLE FIST and beyond without hurting   
  yourself?  
- PRO-TIP #1: [Buy the Biggest Plug you can just sit and camp on for hours](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007GFR848/ref=twister_B00QI1GM5W?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
- I would just camp out and sit on it as you would sit with your butt 
  touching the balls of your feet so you can control the weight you are   
  exerting and just slowly rock and grind on it while watching TV.  
- Do your normal warm up or play and then hop on.
- When you get as far as it goes, back it off a tad and simply slip a 
  finger or a skinny toy in alongside. I would go with fingers for easy   
  control.  
- Now wiggle around and push, pull, stretch. FISH HOOK that ring and 
  PULL the ring out and to the side and away from the center. one finger.   
  HOOK AND PULL.  
- **It's surprisingly pliable when you work on little sections**
  and not try and turn a 2" ring into a 6 inch ring in one session by   
  stretching in 360 degrees and all directions AT THE SAME TIME. You just   
  focus on and work on little sections.  
  **PHYSICS 101: WHY THIS WORKS:** If you ever had to take  
  a tires off a bicycle rim - no way could you just stretch the tire out   
  in all directions and pull it off right?  
- NO. Instead you get out the little lever-tool to focus your leverage 
  and stretch on small sections and then just rinse/repeat and go around   
  the rim and the tire would pop right off, yeah?  
- **Same principle**
- Except in this case, the tire IS YO ASS and the lever tool is your finger or small toy
  Anyway. ONE LITTLE SECTION AT A TIME. GO AROUND AND AROUND. TUG.   
  Stretch. Wiggle. SEESAW - fish hook and pull. Just MOVE THINGS AROUND.  
  But you go slooow. Seriously - you camp in front of the tv and watch   
  Arrested Development reruns. Just stretch a little bit and go around the  
  ring. Over and over. dozens of times.  
- Start with one finger and then if it feels ok, go for two. If it 
  hurts, back off. If things dry up, drench everything with lube Once   
  you're gone around a few times and can no longer refuse the calling of   
  the dark side of the Force,  pull finger or toy out from alongside and   
  now just allow your weight to slowly drive you down ...impaling yourself  
  as deeply as you can manage.  
- Feel that stretch? You got a little further than before didn't ya? 
  Yes you DID you filthy slut. Rinse/repeat 3-4-5 times and then move on   
  to the real reason you play and resist the urge to push it in your first  
  / second/ third session.  
- But if you are trying to get a slightly larger toy in for the first 
  time and want to know if your force training to become an ASS JEDI is   
  working, then this is where you grab it and try and get the tip in.  
- Nope? s'ok Rome wasn't built in a day, you go back to the smaller toy
  and slide something in next door that's a little bigger and you stretch  
  some more until you CAN get the next bigger toy in.  
- THAT'S IT. That's all there is to it. There you go. Rinse. Repeat. 
  With a little patience, You will start to see results without pain. It's  
  really that simple.  
- PRO-TIP # 2: Stop touching your wiener during these stretch-armstrong
  anal training sessions. Stop trying to get hard and enjoy yourself at   
  the same time. Period. full stop.  
  Let me rephrase for the *Fellas - don't touch your cock at all.* NO PLAYING WITH YOUR JUNK. HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD. ANYWHERE BUT THERE.  
  I can only speak for myself on this and have to separate the fairer   
  sex for the moment. Girls, your experience may vary. We clench   
  everything to keep our wood going and fellas - we're gonna talk about   
  this again further down.  
- DEPTH TRAINING
  Very deep penetration above and beyond the rectum and through the   
  inner sphincter around the corner and through the woods to grammas house  
  primarily involves training that inner/upper sphincter to open up with   
  soft, flexible and skinny-ish toys. Or a skilled top if you have the   
  girth thing down pat - or have a very skinny human of slight build to   
  shove their fist in you and slip a finger or three through and open you   
  up that way.  
- The below presumes you are (forever) alone. =)
- Couple things before you really start fooling around with depth.
  Above all - it can be dangerous if you don't listen to your body or   
  have ingested anything that would interfere with said senses. Dont' do   
  it.  
- You have to REALLY Clean out the works. Enema bag. The whole bit.
- no REALLY, a fuckton of lube (ok, at least a few ounces - can use 
  the enema bag or syringe or lube shooter device) poured into you in the   
  face down ass up position.  
- Protip: jojoba oil by itself first or Pjur Back Door lube has jojoba 
  oil and extract incorporated in the product . Pjur analyse me has   
  another relaxing ingredient as well.  
  Also - there is something about JLUBE, properly made, it's about the slipperiest stuff on the planet.  
- (BTW -HEADSUP ON VAG FISTERS: Jlube may not be a good idea for vag 
  fisting unless you are going to do do the full douche clean afterwards   
  as the product is mostly (75%) sugar and sugar in the vag can lead to   
  massive yeast infections and other issues.  
- To train for the deep anal stuff, you need to start with a specific tool.
- If you are just looking to spend money, Square Peg/ MR. S makes a very specific type of toy [called a slink for this type of training](https://www.mr-s-leather.com/sex-toys/square-peg-sex-toys/square-peg-depth)
  For those on a budget, you don't need to spend 100 bucks (or more) on  
  it when a long skinny jelly dong or double dildo (1.0 - 1.5 inches wide  
  or LESS) is a good fit.  
- [The inexpensive version is here.](https://www.amazon.com/Seesee-Double-Headed-Pen-NIS-Simu-Lation-Purple/dp/B085T28N5D/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B085T28N5D&qid=1624806872&s=hpc&sr=1-1)
  Now you just have to take your time and mess around with insertion   
  angles but ideally you are looking to thread it up (kinda aim towards   
  the back of your belly button) and then push it over to YOUR left (the   
  person feeding it into you - would be their RIGHT)  
  PRO TIP: Laying on YOUR left side with your right knee pulled up may   
  help you thread the needle - it's what the Docs do when you go for a   
  colonoscopy and thread the scope up and through the upper ring so they   
  can see whats going on up there in your guts.  
- [Here's a pic so you can sorta visualize](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-colon#1) what you are dealing with when you thread it up in there.
  When you see fisting pro anal bottoms that can take it elbow deep and  
  beyond, that is what is going on - they got straightened out in a   
  process that takes a very long time (years to really get into the upper   
  arm and shoulder deep penetrations with larger full size humans)  
- It's fairly easy with a skinny and floppy toy, and you can do it easy
  in a few sessions of trial and error and some patience and then you   
  work up from there.  
- A good top knows how to very slowly nudge and move things around and 
  'straighten you out' over the course of many (dozens, hundreds) of   
  sessions so that your tunnel no longer hangs a hard right, it just goes   
  straight in.  
  If you REALLY want to do the rectal rooter snake bit - something like this might be a good fit:  
- [https://www.amazon.com/Hosed-Inch-Anal-Snake-Beaded/dp/B07DQCYTSP/ref=sr_1_23?dchild=1&keywords=The+Bump&qid=1598860732&s=hpc&sr=1-23](https://www.amazon.com/Hosed-Inch-Anal-Snake-Beaded/dp/B07DQCYTSP/ref=sr_1_23?dchild=1&keywords=The+Bump&qid=1598860732&s=hpc&sr=1-23)
- **PROTECTING YOUR TOYS:**
- You generally want to put a rubber on your toys if there is ever any 
  possibility that they will ever be used by others. Most toys are porous   
  and do not wash up completely sterile and cooties grow. The toy may LOOK  
  clean and FEEL clean, then you hand it to a girl and she comes down   
  with a very nasty UTI at the minimum and land her in the hospital or   
  worse.  
- Finally, a lot of the popular toys are made in China and have all 
  sort of chemicals that can burn and cause problems. My Rascal Black   
  Balled turned into a whole lot of burning love after a few months after   
  the coating they spray on it to make it shiny (and protect you from the   
  chemicals that burn ) wore off.  
  So you put a condom on it. The Magnum XL's are good for most toys up   
  to 2.5 inches wide or so but will often break on a 3 inch wide toy on   
  insertion - you might have a look at something like a **[FEMALE CONDOM](http://www.condomdepot.com/product/detail.cfm/pid/2651)  
  which is 3 inches wide and will handle about anything from a BAM , XL   
  Jumbo , Great American Challenge , Bulldozer, the bigger TSX stuff like   
  the GigaDong and MegaDong and everything in the 3-4 inch range.  
- Which brings me to ....
- **FISTING!**
- Gloves: Yes or no?
  It's up to you but I myself have had a bad episode as a top and she   
  ended up getting nicked which turned into an infection and an abscess   
  the size of an orange and had to have surgery. (yes, scalpel on Vag -   
  catheter, the whole bit)  
  So for me, it's a no brainer - NOOBS USE GLOVES. If you only knew   
  what's under your fingernail beds and if you touch doorknobs and handles  
  and shake hands - it just gets crazy.  
- I'm not trying to tell you what to do but there are too many bugs 
  running around that do not respond to anti-biotics anymore to take these  
  chances.  
- Plus the right glove knocks down the friction and the drag. Big things go into little things easier.
- When it comes to NOOBS doing VAG or ANAL Fisting, if you are a bit of
  a germophobe and looking for 'above and beyond' I might also suggest a   
  antibacterial lube like [THIS](http://www.amazon.com/Soothe-Anal-Bacteral-Lubricant/dp/B003N9J4MU)  
- **GLOVES**
- Some (most of) of the latex drugstore kind are not ideal for insertion and that was not their intended function.
- They may be textured to allow a greater tactile sense for those in the medical profession actually handling scalpels etc.
- They usually have baby powder or talc of some kind on them.
- Tip from Waterwagon: Try [Black Dragon gloves](http://www.blackdragonglove.com/) Powder free. [Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_13?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=black%20dragon%20gloves&sprefix=black+dragon+%2Caps%2C216)
- Tip from Mistress D: *I did notice the mention of sharp/ hard 
  nails. the best way I have found to take care of that short of cutting   
  them is to put cotton balls in the finger tips of the gloves. works for   
  me. :D*  
- For casual players and NOOBS you are pretty much set. Just add lube.
- For pro handball players there are other resources on the web such as [Twist My Arm](https://www.twistmyrubberarm.com/index.php?info=search&k0=him_gloves_mitts)
- NOTE: I recently answered a post on this subject and one Domme who is
  well versed in using her fists lamented that she doesn't like to glove   
  up but kinda has to because she refuses to cut her nails.  
  They make a tool for that and it's called fingerTIP gloves. No, really - [it's a thing](http://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Finger-Gloves-Versatile-Coverage/dp/B0002NYPGU/ref=zg_bs_705321011_3)  
  You can cut them down to fit as you like - use the tip from Mistress D  
  (Cotton balls) on top of your fingernails - wrap in gauze or tape - add  
  a fingertip glove and you can go right in - the water's fine. If anyone  
  needs a crash test dummy for this - I'm available and willing to do it,  
  you know, for SCIENCE. Inquiring minds want to know.  
- LUBE: Everyone has the thing they swear by. From WET or EROS to 
  J-Lube, Fist Powder and there are probably 50 brands now and (with the   
  exception of Jlube and Fist powder and others of the ilk which you mix   
  yourself) they tend to be expensive which may inhibit their use because   
  you really need a LOT and squirting 1/2 a bottle of some $30 dollar lube  
  gets crazy after a while.  
- I like J lube just from a economic standpoint. You can whip up a 
  quart of the stuff for a couple bucks. A lot of people swear by JLube   
  and it IS slippery as hell but being water based, tends to dry out   
  quickly. Keep a spray bottle/mister with lukewarm water for re   
  aplication.  
- A new product of this type is called [FIST POWDER](http://www.fistpowder.com/fistpowder/en/lubricant-fistpowder/)
  which is supposed to be JLUBE on crack, less stringy and approved for   
  human internal use. (Jlube is actually a vet/farm product)  
- Have not tried the fistpowder but have extensive experience with Jlube and if it's all that, it's worth the [25 bucks at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Powder-Natural-Water-Lubricant-Concentrate/dp/B0084ENVLO)
- For strictly anal Fisting, lots of folks SWEAR by CRISCO. YUP it's a 
  very thick and greasy sort of thing and actually has a lot of drag and   
  tends to slow you down but it also smooths things out a bit which can   
  add a layer of comfort and knock down the edges and corners a bit.  
  If you don't feel like running out to a sex shop or waiting 3 days   
  for the UPS truck - it's old school and if it's not in the house, it's   
  on the shelf at about any grocery or corner drugstore.  
- Other popular lubes are EROS, GUN OIL , [Boy Butter](http://boybutterlubes.com/product-info), and the list goes on.
  **BRING YOUR 'A GAME' - HANDBALL EDITION**  
- But when you go 'all in on the handball court', you have to gear up. 
  Some of these links may be dead but now you know what to search for.  
- From Mr S Leather : [Elbow length gloves](http://www.mr-s-leather.com/R320/latex-gloves-elbow-length.html)
- [MEO](http://www.meo.de/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=66_65&products_id=8238)
- [SLAM DUNK LUBE](http://www.mr-s-leather.com/D068/slam-dunk-lube.html) is one you hear a lot about. Has clove oil in it which is another oil with relaxant properties without numbing you.
- Jojoba oil is another relaxing oil. mix with your lube , open up and say ahhhhh.
  For the folks going 'ALL IN' on the handball court , you really need to check out [Chris Ward's guide to fisting - it's a must read](http://web.archive.org/web/20101104091444/http://www.ctfistersnet.net/Fisting_a_Virgin.php)  
- Also check out [XOF FISTING WORLD](http://xof.ff.online.fr/guide.html)
- FOR FISTING TOPS WHO CAN'T QUITE BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE>
- I find that once I have pushed my four fingers  (stacked vertical) 
  and those fingertips hit the far side, then I allow them to curl into a   
  fist (keep thumb out) and just use that to stretch . I will rotate those  
  fingers 90 degrees left and right (imagine TURNING A DOORKNOB) to OPEN   
  THINGS UP.  
- bring all your fingers to a POINT TUCK YOUR THUMB INTO the 
  middle so that your thumb just about touches the last joint of your   
  fingers before they meet your hand. [Look at the toy Sasha Grey uses on   
  Belladonna in this clip][[https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=293787302&t=1488](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=293787302&t=1488)] OR watch Bella teach Jenna Haze all about angles in [THIS CLIP][[https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=140191713](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=140191713)]  
- NOW. USE YOUR OTHER HAND to SQUEEZE and COMPRESS your bones in your 
  hand by PINCHING the sides of your hand right about there your knuckles   
  form a line across your hand.  
- Slowly screw your fingers left and right until you are buried to the 
  hilt and you are 'hung up' on the fattest part of your hand. You are   
  feeling for the point of least resistance. There is a BONE up top at 12 o  
  clock but the rest of the ring is just skin.  
- Try to find where there is a little slack and put your weight on it 
  and now USE YOUR OTHER HAND TO REALLY SQUEEZE and COMPRESS all the   
  fingers and bones in your wrist closer together. Try to squeeze and PULL  
  your outermost knuckles INWARD towwards the palm of your hand and then   
  sueezer them up and own and towards the CENTER of the INSIDE of your   
  hand.  
- You will feel the bones in your hand actually move and realign THIS 
  REDUCES THE CROSS SECTION , MASS and CIRCUMFERENCE of your hand. We are   
  dealing in 1/16th and 1/8 inch increments.  
- There is usually about a 1/2 to an inch or more of circumference that you can 'steal back' with this move.
- Now, BRACE your penetrating arm and slowly lean into your bottom and 
  put YOUR WEIGHT ON IT (ala Dolamite) and let your bottom feel the   
  inexorable force pushing down at them as they start to crack open,   
  COMPRESS YOUR FIST with your other hand and stabilize yourself.  
- Finally, back off and just SOAK YOUR HAND with lube, slip it in and out several times. now soak it again.
  Now it's up to your bottom to run the show - all they have to do it   
  push back a little and/or guide you - feed back to you on HOW MUCH   
  WEIGHT TO PUT BEHIND YOUR FIST BORING INTO THEM.  
- You can alternate between using your other hand to squeeze the bones 
  in your fist and trying to go in alongside and stretch that last little   
  bit of the ring that need to give just a wee bit more before everything   
  slides home in a rush of AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  
- PROTIP: some tops are scared to really bring it and some bottoms get a
  little too ouchie with the mouthie and you chicken out and don't get it  
  done.  
- Some bottoms can take it but being a fist ornament and not in control
  does not allow them to push through. I can ride a road cone but the   
  first time I got put in a sling with no warm up and my top punches her   
  fist into me without breaking stride, I flipped out.  
- Moral: Sometimes you are better off letting the bottom run the show and you just provide the FIST.
- FInd a bench, chair or stool of the right height so you can lay your 
  arm flat across it , and bring your hand up and aim it at the ceiling so  
  your bottom can STRADDLE you and have their opening just above where   
  your fingertips end so they can just DROP and use their own WEIGHT to   
  bring it down on you.  
  I bet if you can't bring the power to break on through - your bottom CAN.  
- And that, my friends is my advice as a top when you get hung up and just can't seem to push though. Added to the material.
- RANDOM THOUGHTS.
  [POPPERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppers) - (wiki)  
- I myself have never tried them. I understand they are popular with 
  the cool kids on the hardcore underground playgrounds because they are a  
  shortcut to relaxing and opening up when you don't have the luxury of   
  just laying back and putting on a Earth, Wind & Fire album in the   
  privacy of your home and running through your tantric routine. You're in  
  a public playspace and folks are waiting their turn. You don't have 30   
  minutes. So you do your mini-workout , hop up in the sling or the crane   
  HUUUUFFFFFFFFFF your bottle and prepare to get hollowed out by Godzilla.  
- I'm not that cool or that hardcore. I learned the way you just read 
  about and by the time I heard about poppers, finding good poppers was   
  such a pain in the ass that I took a pass.  
  Oh - One obvious NONO while using poppers is Viagra. You will end up in an ER.  
- ** The Elusive 'ANAL ORGASM'**
  2nd most popular question on fetlife = Noobs asking about the 'ANAL   
  ONLY ORGASM' and the simple truth is - at least in my humble opinion, it  
  doesn't exist in most men in any degree of force, frequency or   
  attainability that registers on the meter.  
- Sure, you get turned into a dildo or fist ornament for an hour 
  including a few jackhammer sessions, you may feel something and you may   
  even feel strongly enough about it to CALL IT an orgasm but it's not the  
  usual 'POP' that you are accustomed to and it's not a POP that   
  satisfies you.  
- IMVO, your entire learned climax response is based on the 
  evolutionary requirement of your penis being inserted into a vagina and   
  thrust until orgasm and ejaculation.  
  While the stimulation from the prostate does add a LOT to the party -  
	- but by itself you are just banging a gland until it oozes (or maybe 
	  you do get a spasm but that's not a 'POP -ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh'.  
	  Wheres my smokes?  
	  That said - if it has been long enough, anything is possible.   
	  Especially if you are young and healthy and it's been a while. If you   
	  don't believe me, [watch this video from TS Fluery](https://twitter.com/i/status/1412561438770671621)  
- That is a load of jizz squirting out the top in response to (as far 
  as I can tell) nothing more than being pounded in the ass by a fucking   
  machine on BLAST). Looks like a smallish dildo that hits the spot   
  perfectly on short strokes and just BAMBAMBAMBAM until she clenched down  
  and nutted up.  
  For most folks - the presence of squirting white sticky stuff is enough proof of concept for them.  
- Don't have a fucking machine to pound you into a pool of cum glazed filth?
- THE KEY IS TO ABSTAIN AS LONG AS YOU CAN
  If you abstain from all sex, all fapping or climaxes for say, 30   
  days, you may discover that you can stick the tip of a hitachi magic   
  wand up your ass, flip it on and watch your DNA splatter the wall but   
  make no mistake - you were hard as a fucking rock and the vibration from  
  the hitachi on HIGH also fills the need for Mr. Happy to have some   
  stimulation as well. It doesn't take a helluva lot if you are on the   
  young side of 40 and have not popped in 30 days.  
  But just to be sure, before you insert - do as much edging as you can stand to get the pumps primed good.  
  When you get to the point you can HEAR your pulse in your ears and   
  watch your cock JUMP with each beat - you're probably about there - but   
  99.9999% of you will give in and KAPLOOEYEYYY long before you get there.  
  If you CAN actually abstain for 30 days , edge for a day or two after  
  that and then stick a hitachi up your butt - do yourself a favor and   
  once you have proven to yourself that you CAN do it - right before you   
  go over the edge , do yourself a favor and don't waste what is sure to   
  the best orgasm of your life.  
- FAP THE FUCK ON and launch your swimmers right off the face of the planet.
- This is how you colonize other worlds. It's all about protecting humanity, science and furthering our species.
- But for other 99.9999% of the population that isn't about to wait a 
  fucking month and already desensitized by internet porn and already   
  fapped 5 times this week and it's only TUESDAY......... if you WANT to   
  actually pop and squirt and say AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH and reach for your   
  smokes after, you have to include Mr. Happy.  
- So let's talk about that. Reality. The 99.999%
- So HOW EXACTLY DO YOU BLOW YOUR LOAD RIGHT OFF THE FACE OF THE PLANET with your ass being rammed at the same time?
- Because for most of the noobish folks, it's a problem. Most dudes 
  simply can not get and keep their wood while getting railed. It's just   
  too much and without wood, it's very difficult to pop at all.  
- **HOW TO CUM DURING FUCKING***
  First time you try this- I really suggest you WAIT for a few days, if  
  you are 40 or older ...maybe a little longer....a week or 2 or whatever  
  it takes so that you are just DYING to pop. Just backed up.  
  So step one - get whatever it is that you are using for penetration IN.  
  Do your normal warmup and insert whatever you normally play with - your mainstream "GO TO" fucktoy.  
- Once you've got it in. STOP. DO . NOT. MOVE.
- I MEAN, FORGET ABOUT IT.
- You fucking lay there for 5/15/30 minutes or whatever it takes until the feeling you are being torn in two goes away.
- Read a book. Watch a movie. No kidding. Take your mind off of 'it'.
- Wait until the feeling of urgency goes away.
- Now. Squeeze your KEGELS. CLAMP DOWN ON WHATEVER'S IN THERE.
- CLENCH AS HARD AS YOU CAN.
- First few times it feels like you're crippled. It hurts if you PUSH 
  IT TOO HARD doesn't it? It's counter intuitive, your're already out of   
  sorts and now you want to FLEX those muscles already stretched to their   
  limit? Are you out of your mind?  
- You just have to loosen up a little and give the muscle some room to flex.
  Slide a finger or something small as discussed above in alongside the  
  toy and stretch around until you have 'created' a little slack - so to   
  speak. LOOSEN THINGS UP A LITTLE. Remember the 'changing a bicycle tire'  
  reference ? Same idea.  
- Get things nice and loose.
- Now squeeze your Kegels again. CLAMP DOWN AND COUNT TO 5. (as you get better you hold for 10 and 15 and 20)
- And again. And Again. And Again. KEEP GOING until you know you've got it.
  My whole point is when you get to the point that *it no longer hurts   
  at all to clench down on whatever it is that's in there * - you've got   
  wood naturally.  
- *Because that's the ONLY thing that was holding you back before.*.
  Let me repeat - THAT WAS THE ONLY THING that was getting in your way.  
- Now that you can CLENCH DOWN ON IT AND GRIND IT OUT + GOOD WOOD,
- That's the ballgame. Your only problem now will be lasting long 
  enough and not blowing your load in 5 strokes to do a little edging and   
  really popcorn the ceiling when you let the little swimmers fly.  
- TIP: KEGELS
- The stronger they are , *the harder your WOOD, the harder you bust and the harder and farther you squirt when you POP.*
- It's THAT SIMPLE.
- You can do [CLENCHING EXERCISES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise) sitting at your desk looking at your computer screen, driving, waiting in line. Anytime.
- You should be doing clenches until you can do 100 fast ones and then 
  clench and HOLD for a 5 count x 10 reps and work your way up to a 10   
  count and 25 reps.  
- DO THAT and you will be amazed and what a huge difference it makes how hard you BUST in as little as a week.
- Now it's time to get lubed (Mr Happy) up if this is a solo thing.
  You could use whatever lube you already are using for your ass - but   
  here I am going to tell you the single greatest jackoff lube on the   
  planet.  
- **There is nothing better. TRUST ME.**
- And what is this wonderful lube you ask?
- [HAWAIIAN TROPIC DARK TANNING OIL](http://www.amazon.com/Hawaiian-Tropic-Dark-Tanning-Original/dp/B0009SV1XS/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1320631007&sr=8-1-spell)
- Not lotion and not that dry spray crap. Get the exact stuff I linked to. NO SPF , JUST OIL.
- BEST JO lube on the planet. It's slippery but it's not *slick* where you lose all the friction and fellas, you know what I'm talking about . FRICTION IS GOOD.
- It warms to touch and scented.
- Squirt a little in your palm and just surround yourself with your hand.
- Relax. Take your time. Pop on a video now or think happy thoughts ;-)
- Now gently squeeze tight and pull your hand and wiener OUT AND AWAY FROM YOUR BODY.
- What just happened? Your kegels just flexed didn't they? Automatic.
  It's like you're body saying 'Hey - where the fuck do YOU think you   
  are going? GET BACK HERE!' and you clenched up and pulled back a tad.  
  Just keep squeezing and a little PULL or PULL so you get a little bit  
  of friction - not a rapid up and down. Just SQUUEEEZE and PULL.  
- Think. SLOW, WARM, FRICTION.
- Not fap fap fap fap fap at 120 beats per minute.
- SIMPLY SQUEEZE TIGHT and GENTLY PULL OUT AND AWAY.
- You can allow just a little 'slippage' to get just a little friction 
  going where the nerve endings are most abundant but the idea is just to   
  SURROUND YOURSELF WITH WARMTH AND SLIPPERINESS AND SQUEEZE AND PULL AWAY  
  JUST A LITTLE SO YOU GET MAX FRICTION.  
- Take your mind of of it and enjoy what you watching on screen or the 
  back of your eyeballs. Relax. No worries. Keep going until you feel   
  things start moving down there.  
- LATER SQUEEZE YOUR KEGELS AS HARD AS YOU CAN AND HOLD THE CLENCH WHILE 
  YOU DRIVE YOUR HIPS UPWARD OR FORWARDS SO YOUR WIENER PUSHES THROUGH   
  YOUR FIST.  
- THIS IS THE CRITICAL 'CONNECT THE DOT' for your brain. YOU ARE 
  CLENCHING UP AND DRIVING FORWARD AS YOU USUALLY WOULD IN VANILLA M/F   
  PENETRATIVE SEX.  
- The first time you might feel a little silly. Don't. You are retraining your mind.
- Keep going until you feel things perk up and keep working it up until
  you are hard. SQUEEZE with your kegel muscles HARD and you will feel   
  things fill a little down there. Now CLENCH AND DRIVE FORWARD through   
  your hand. KEEP CLENCHING as hard as you can. DO NOT move the toy yet.  
  If you prepped right and you are actually COMFORTABLE with whatever   
  you have in being there - you will watch Mr. Happy perk up and in a   
  short time you will have as good of an erection as you have ever had.  
- LATER you can start the thrusting toy in and out and NOW it doesn't 
  FEEL CRAZY when you try and CLENCH DOWN ON IT as you normally do to get   
  and keep your WOOD so you can POP. You'll know it when you've got it.   
  The feeling is intense as you more or less 'lock up' on the toy. It may   
  feel like you are slamming all 18 inches of Rambone up in you, but it's   
  really only an inch or 3. Remember if you are laying on your back to   
  ramp the angle 'up' and aim for the back of your belly , angle is   
  important to really hit that spot.  
- LATER YOU CAN TAKE YOURSELF TO POUNDTOWN.
- Now, the TRICK to being a GOOD LITTLE FUCKTOY and keeping your wood 
  GOING WHILE YOU GET FUCKED is you CLENCH on the OUT STROKE when she's   
  pulling out.  
- PRO TIP: it's EASIER to CLENCH DOWN HARD when it's going OUT than the INSTROKE.
- When it's going IN, you want to be all nice and loosey goosey and wide open.
- Then when she goes to pull back CLENCH DOWN HARD, squeeze your weiner
  (you're fapping like a fucking MADMAN obviously of course) and thrust   
  UP and THROUGH your fist -mimicking that regular PIV penetrative sex we   
  talked about.  
- Continue SQUEEZING AND SQUEEZING those kegels *because this is how you keep your wood hard*.
- You never even realized you were doing this with normal sex but once 
  you have something the size of a soda can buried in your ass (it doesn't  
  have to BE a soda can to FEEL like a soda can kids) you becomes ACUTELY  
  aware and if it HURTS just BEING in there, there's NO FUCKING WAY you   
  are going to clench down even HARDER on it and THIS is WHY it's so hard   
  to get wood and keep wood while you are being fucked. This is how you   
  train yourself to be immune to it.  
  I've seen a lot of strapon videos that are usually straight(er) dudes  
  that have not learned this trick - they have no wood and totally soft.   
  The whole time.  
  Once you learn how to really RELAX so that is is no longer   
  UNCOMFORTABLE to clench down HARD and SQUEEZE whatever's in there WHEN   
  YOU HAVE TO - THAT's the key to getting and keeping your wood and   
  blowing your load during your fucking.  
  The first time you actually do it and get a hard on and the realization YOU CAN DO THIS DAWNS ON YOU - that's the ballgame.  
- REPEAT TIP: It's a lot easier to BUST on something that is a little 
  smaller than the one you had a minute ago so bust as hard and fat as you  
  can all you want, but when you are ready to bust, swap for a thinner   
  and skinnier toy.  
- I usually use a 13 x 3 for stretching fun and then when I am ready to bust, I swap for Rambone with is 2.5 x 15 or so.
- Using the fatter one and then dropping down to a slimmer and longer toy helps you go deeper.
- **STRAPON Harnesses.** I've always loved Stormy Leather.
  The Terra Firma is a popular model and you can do pretty much whatever   
  with different sized rubber O rings.  
- Stormy made a 3 inch rubber ring which could stretch to 3.5 that 
  handles the common big rubber like BAM, Great American Challenge, Super   
  Ballsey Cock, Black Balled Cock, and XL Jumbo Jack.  
- You can also find STEEL rings in 2.5 and 3.0 at [Mr. Hankey](https://www.mrhankeystoys.com/shop) along with some unique homegrown strapon dildos as seen on TV. Carmen Rivera, etc
  Oh - you want bigger? We can do bigger, they make a tool for that. It's called HOME DEPOT.  
- Something like this [Danco 119 which is 3 and 7/8](http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&langId=-1&catalogId=10053&productId=202071000&R=202071000)
- Or the Danco 120 which is [4 inches](http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=202071001&storeId=10051&langId=-1&catalogId=10053&MERCH=REC-_-product-2-_-202071003-_-202071001-_-N)
- That should do it for anything you intend to throw at some ass.
  Now if you get Amazing Ty yelling 'Give me 20 pounds of rubber cock   
  thats 20 inches long by 6 inches wide and make it HURT' - You break out a  
  122.  
- The 122 is [5 and 7/8ths wide](http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=202071003&storeId=10051&langId=-1&catalogId=10053&MERCH=REC-_-product-1-_-202071001-_-202071003-_-N)
  The 119 or 120 should handle anything you have to throw - most of the  
  big stuff is really only 3 - 3.5 thick and Stormy sells a large ring   
  set that handles that easily - this is for stuff like Super Lance or any  
  of Creative Moulding's 'Super Dildo' line  
- **PREPPING** for an anal session. Diet and Hygiene CLEANING OUT.
- 'THE ANAL DIET'
- It's a joke in the porn industry because there *really is no diet* when you are doing 2 or 3 scenes a day and just getting your little ass fucked right off.
- You simply DON'T EAT. Period.
- They do water fasts or juice fasts. Maybe a *clear workout or energy drink* with protein (no fucking dairy).
- They will book anal scenes for a couple days or as many days as they 
  can stand and then take OFF a couple days and go pig out at MightyTaco   
  which is DEFINITELY not on the to list the night before you are getting   
  your ass busted wide open.  
- Usually a performer will lose 10-20 pounds once they start doing lots of anal.
- That's  why it's called the anal diet. You lose 20 pounds the first month. Because you don't eat. Meth helps too. (kidding)
  That said - for the rest of us non-professionals? ?  
  Eat lot of fiber and add things like psyllium husks and before you   
  know you are getting some - you clean out with an enema until the water   
  runs clear.  
- Yep, you go and get the little [10 dollar rubber bag and hose kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BH8BL2/ref=oh_o00_s02_i00_details)
  and you get down on the floor and stick your lilly white ass WAY up   
  high n the air as vertical as you can get and pop that hose in and fill   
  er up.  
- For pro players you get something like this [STREEM MASTER](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R8MSH6/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or if you don't mind doing a little work you get a [SHOWER SHOT like this](http://www.amazon.com/Cleanstream-LE776-Shower-Enema-System/dp/B002FCN7Y2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365269472&sr=8-1&keywords=shower+shot)
  **HOW FAR CAN I REALLY PUSH IT - That Volkswagen looks like it might fit....**  
- There is a hard limit for girth AND depth for everyone. Don't be in 
  such a fucking rush. It's not a race and if you want a girl to   
  participate, there is a boundary among most the civilian chicks between   
  'Oh kewl you're KINKY!' and 'ZOMG YOU FREAK! GET AWAY!'.  
- IMHO it gets exponentially more difficult to find someone that can 
  keep up with you once you get into the really big stuff. But back to   
  YOUR limits.  
- For many folks it's going to be somewhere in the vicinity of 3.5 -4.0
  inches in width(males). I've seen some dudes that can go over 4 inches   
  wide and even FIVE inches wide. No really. See below. To be clear, not   
  condoning this. He has taken this to an extreme hat even makes me   
  cringe.  
  Dude is north of 5 inches wide. He's riding two dildos that range 2.7  
	- 2.85 something inches wide and he's like: [FUCK IT - DO EM BOTH SAME 
	  TIME][[https://www.xtube.com/video-watch/double-ass-fuck-with-huge-dildos-and-a-fist-9815651](https://www.xtube.com/video-watch/double-ass-fuck-with-huge-dildos-and-a-fist-9815651)]  
- Bottom Line, at some point you will hit things that do not yield. If you are super skinny, that helps.
- Little things like the angle of attack or which way is facing front 
  can matter when trying to get a bigger toy in for the first time ever.  
  I have found to get the really FAT stuff in it's easiest for me if I   
  do a a 'squatfuck' or sort of 'impale yourself from above' sort of   
  operation. I theorize that the simple act of squatting as humans did   
  until modern toilets made us sit instead of squat - but for thousands of  
  years we squatted to poop and the simple act of doing so sends a signal  
  to the brain * open doors*.....  
- You also need to be aware of the shape of the object. Many dildos are
  molded to present like a very large penis. In the case of the [Rascal Black Balled Cock](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SN7TRA/ref=oh_o03_s00_i00_details)  
  , I found I was having a hellish time getting it in using my tried and   
  proven 'impale yourself from above' approach and realized that it may   
  just be the shape of head and the fattest part of the ridge combined   
  with the angle of attack.  
- I seemed to keep getting 'hung up' *right on that last teeny bit*
- So I turned it 180 degrees and BOOM. And I learned. What may seem 
  insert-mountable oftentimes boils down to a fraction of an inch. And I   
  know it's cliche but that final little bit can often be overcome by   
  simply backing up, dumping a fuckton of lube on both the tip of the   
  dildo and the opening it's going into, taking a deep breath and putting   
  some GRUNT into it.  
  Hope this helps. Report back with your findings - for science!  
- Thanks!

- And finally, [a tongue in cheek (heh) summary](https://fetlife.com/users/1054352/posts/6255989) of how to live with yourself after you give up dat ass like a slut to the strapon wielding woman in YOUR life.
- Hint: It involves Superman.
- PS if this is more than just a passing fancy for you, you might check out our **Fetlife group WOMEN WHO LIKE TO WATCH MEN GET FISTED**
- **PPS: WHAT ABOUT VAGISTYLE TIPS AND TRICKS AND FISTING? CAN A GIRL GET A LITTLE LOVE ROUND HERE?**
- **Yes, my love. I am EEOC compliant. While a lot of the content above is unisex, This section is just for you.**
- The first thing you want to read up on, is the the A-spot also known 
  as the anterior fornix erogenous zone (AFE zone), or “deep spot.”  
- Like the G-spot, it’s located on the front wall of the vagina—the one
  closest to the belly button—but it’s situated a few inches deeper,   
  right in front of the cervix.  
- While the cervix itself is known as a 'spot' (any girl who has 
  climaxed like a screaming banshee getting railed just so his bits are   
  touching your bits in the cervix "just right" knows what I mean.)  
- Some girls like a battering ram, but most prefer a lighter touch and 
  very deliberate touch. It hurts getting cock essentially rammed into a   
  STOP SIGN.  
- By massaging the cervix itself, they are also stimulating this A spot
  which is thought by many ( I myself have no idea, I'm just here for the  
  1/2 price drinks and the buffet) to be the precursor to the 'deep   
  vaginal' type orgasms vs the lighter clitroal ones.  
- PRO TIP LEVEL 1 : For girls who get super sensitive after they cum 
  clitorally, you can keep the party going and even kick it up a notch or   
  three switching to that deeper style and go for the A SPOT.  
- Some girls have discovered they can, in fact, cum from ANAL in 
  certain positions because teh weiner is hitting the A spot FROM THE   
  OTHER SIDE. Yes! Tis true.  
- POSITIONS Think: reverse cowgirl and she's leaning all the way back so the cockhead is aimed at the back of her bellybutton.
  Also - that porny looking 'face down and ass way WAY UP - like,   
  POINTED AT THE CEILING ' and he's squatfucking/piledriving from above   
  and pounding hard.  
- This is also the fisting secret some women have realized as well, 
  just by organic presence, a fist deep in your vag is almost surely going  
  to apply pressure and stimulation to these spots but an artistic   
  practitioner can just wipe the floor with a girl out if he knows exactly  
  what he is doing.  
- I like to rotate my fist like I am holding a doorknob (cervix being 
  the KNOB in this equation) my knuckles are just raking all these spots   
  repeatedly and I can even tease the cervix opening (don't try to   
  actually penetrate especially ungloved or if there is any chance she is   
  pregnant) with my fingers and thumb. just tease a little.  
- PROTIP 1.5 Absolutely wear gloves, trip your nails you savages and 
  use a antibacterial lube. Do not use JLUBE for VAG FISTING. It's a bunch  
  of plastic polymer suspended in SUGAR (75% of the product is sugar).   
  Sugar + yeast = yeast infection. No bueno amigos yu amigas. Senors y.   
  Senores.  
- When her clit is all fucked out and too sensitive, you can also get 
  some additional stimulation by either swiping a finger or thumb from   
  your other hand across the actual urethral opening (peehole) .  
- There is a little bundle of nerves there, that if properly 
  manipulated, can add A LOT to the overall party. Fellas, you have this   
  as well, next time you are fapping, use your THUMB and WINDOW WIPER the   
  very tippy tip of your weiner and WHOA! where did THAT come from? You   
  never knew.  
  PROTIP LEVEL 2. A slim metal urethral vibrator (carefully) inserted   
  BEFORE the fist goes in and turned on LATER after everything else is   
  firing on all cylinders and you are in the home stretch will make just   
  about any girl go to pieces and squirt all over you - sensation is above  
  and beyond anything any girl who is not insane has ever tried on   
  herself except for maybe AMAZING TY or DIRTY GARDEN GIRL .....the   
  urethral vibe, inserted,  has bisected an area that includes her clit   
  which actually travels several inches into the vag from the surface -   
  and her G SPOT. It runs right THROUGH THEM. Right up the middle. You are  
  VIBING FROM THE INSIDE. Comprende?  
- So now you have a situation where multiple spots are being directly 
  manipulated from above, below and right up the fucking MIDDLE at the   
  same time. Don't snicker, don't fucking judge me, just GET ONE (or two   
  incase the first one FAILS mid coitus) .  
  [TRUST ME, she will thank you][[https://www.amazon.com/German-Diagnostics-Beginners-Urethral-Vibrator/dp/B088LQ3Z48/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=steel+urethral+vibrator&qid=1599249446&sr=8-5](https://www.amazon.com/German-Diagnostics-Beginners-Urethral-Vibrator/dp/B088LQ3Z48/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=steel+urethral+vibrator&qid=1599249446&sr=8-5)] (if she can appreciate this type of stim - not all girls do)  
- PROTIP: Have your biggest and densest beach towels under her ass to clean up the squirt. You will need it.

- # worldbuilding
	- ## origin
		- be 2370. Humans have colonized the entire solar system. Quadrillions of humans exist. Millions of businesses. Thousands of Countries. But only a handful have power.
		- Earth is a unified world government that is maintained by a quantum world intelligence known as Ayanami.
		- Ayanami is benevolent and *truly* operates on the objective of keeping Earthlings happy.
		- That is at the expense of all other humans in the solar system.
		- For Earthlings, life is grand. Heavenly in fact.
		- A cult that is without consequence if an Earthling.
		- be 2420. The solar humans declare war on Earth. Tired of being manipulated by Ayanami, the solar humans invade earth to destroy Ayanami and construct a democratic form of government.
		- Ayanami predicted this. And the earthlings have prepared for this. She enacts a plan of self preservation where every earthling uploads their soul to analog tape decks.
		- The process for each person is a violent and painful proceedure.
		- Each person basically 'jacks into the matrix' and their soul is uploaded to a tape.
		- However, someone has to stay behind to press record.
		- The person who stays behind, must then take the tape to a 'repeater'
		- This repeater is basically a giant switchboard, like those old telephone operator stations or even an analog synthesizer.
		- As the world is destroyed around her, Ayanami creates a micro black hole on the surface of earth, sucking the contents of all the matter into it.
		- Somewhere in the blackness of space, Voyager I turns on, and serves as a quantum entangled worm hole exit, blasting earth's unmangled data at its location. The furthest humanity has ever been.
		- Meanwhile, on Earth, the black hole collapses, creating a massive gamma ray burst, ending solar humanity.
		- Be sometime lightyears in the future. Voyager I is actually used as a relic and source of all enligtenment for a species of space faring elephant.
		- Alerted by the gamma ray burst, as well as the movement of Voyager I, the elephants see it as the return of the great ones.
		- Far more technologically advanced than the earthlings, the elephants are able to synthesize 7 earthling avatars as well as 'geneseeds.'
		- In the practice of good samaratinship, the elephants do not impart any of their own technology in the synthesis of the earthlings.
		- Each of these avatars are a smorgisboard of whatitstits of humans and technology.
		- The elephants create 7 arkseeds, basically mini-earths inside of a artificial biome with thrusters.
		- Before embarking on their quests to seed the galaxy, each avatar meets the leaders of the elephants, they thank them, as gods to gods.
		- As soon as they leave however, a dark force known as the Headmaster appears at the elephant domain.
		- They seek to destroy the earthlings, that which folds time and space.

- ## Original Speech to Text to Clarify
- there's also a character I created where who is a starts off as a within Macs. Her name is Evelyn.  Like basically her father is a military hero. And she's served herself as a Marine in the military. And what she does, after her contract is up, is she starts her own streaming channel where she streams as a 2D anime avatar that focuses on military history, guns, tactics, etc. Her audience believes that she is a military psyop, designed to get young kids to sign up for the military.  Instead of defending herself against the onslaught of criticism, she leans into the accusation and makes a meme out of it. She wins over her audience for her humble yet disciplined attitude. What's interesting about this character, is that she kind of spends a lot of time cultivating an alternate personality. Her 2D streaming personality character, from her real life character. In both worlds she goes by Evelyn. She struggles between separating the two identities. A lot of her content is focused on real world applications such as disassembling firearms or even shooting at the range, so in an effort to separate her real identity from her work, she wears a tech mask which interfaces with her PC software that replaces her real face with the anime Evelyn. Now, this hidden identity is a point of contention for her community and the way she reconciles that is that she needs to protect herself, really, because what she's doing is very controversial, right?  A lot of inter-textual thematic stories are brought to the forefront here such as identity, and dual personality such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In a way, it reverses the typical theme. Evelyn desires to separate her two halves, but struggles to split her identity. As a result, she wears the mask more often than she does not. The mask, for her, represents her 2D avatar while without the mask, she is her real self. However, over time Evelyn realizes that she has no 'real' identity. Without the mask, she is at square one, zero. Here Evelyn presents a moral dilemma: In modern society, we are driven to share our entire lives on line. To almost, upload, our entire lives to the net. However, what happens when there's nothing to upload? What if there wasn't a life worth uploading to begin with? There are so many instances of people who take advantage of this notion for grift. They learn the bear minimum of what it means to be interesting, knowledgeable, or entertaining but the reality is that they simply want a payday. What of the people who's whole life is this networked identity? Those who have a nuanced life that is interesting and truly meaningful. If they are not seen by others, is their life worthless?
- Two popular streamers named Emiru and Watsit visit Evelyn to do a collaboration stream. And they go and meet her. And they open up the door. She's there. And they say, you don't have to hide your face in front of us. We're industry. We know what it's like. And we won't out you or anything. It's OK. And Evelyn's like, but I already covered all the pictures in my house with my face. And they look inside and all the pictures are covered.  They want her to move out to LA. They want her to be part of their streaming house. They want her to build a streaming empire with them. They even say you can keep the mask on.
- However, here's the existential catch. If Evelyn choses to move to LA, she completely will be enveloped by the mask. The past and the identity of herself without the mask, eg: with her father, in the military, with her boyfriend, will disappear.
- Evelyn's boyfriend comes back from deployment.  She's wearing the mask. And there's 1 ,000 people around. Her boyfriend, James, is annoyed by all the attention and is having PTSD episode. He's like, what the fuck is going on? And he's almost losing it. And the MPs come around. They almost have to disperse everything. And then it's her there. And she's like, who are you? I don't know. It's like, it's me. And then he doesn't know it's her. He doesn't believe it's her. Until he hugs her and she smells her. Oh, that's her. They kiss. And then they go in the car. And they're in, let's say, a convoy, a protective convoy. And he's wondering, did I ever, and did I just hop from one war zone to another? And he says, why can't I see you behind that mask? James wants her to take off the mask. ask, and then she's afraid to do so. This is a moment where he finally see her face, because he removes a mask for her, and we actually see her, and she's fucking gorgeous, of course.
- The great dilemma is for her to either chose a life that she's built that brings her value simply in the digital world, that influences millions of people or to chose a life that is real, personal, and private.
