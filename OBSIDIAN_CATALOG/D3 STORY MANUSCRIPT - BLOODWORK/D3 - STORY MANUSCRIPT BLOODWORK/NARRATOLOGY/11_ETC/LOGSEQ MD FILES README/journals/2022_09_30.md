- OK uh leech seed research log 13 aint so today I finished last 2 days I finished blooms the grotesque and and shit I forgot the last one I did after before that ABCD GAGH EFE the amount of no no success at what I'm writing we're shedding anymore so I'm 99% sure I did some research more research on Bloom trying trying to find some like the direction I should take theme or my study's next after this cause I can't go I can go and explore other or other academic academics work and narrow the literature but literature but I feel like blooms themes is just an incomplete an incomplete like conceptualization conceptualization of Of his whole life theoretical or like his whole body of work and I found out that the West he has this whole thing I've called the Western cannon and I'm pretty sure all of the things these universal themes that show up of these 15 directly correlate to the 26 authors who make up the Western cannon according to blown now what this does is For one I feel like i can take the research into different directions 1 where i try and drill down the sort of my interpretation of each theme according to according to the what are the variations of the theme the topos of the 20th each 1 of blooms theory of themes and this is more of a structural mistake to where i can Once I run all of this through the model of theme I can then have these sub themes to associate with and I can continue by the model and then beyond that I can build more experience and understanding by I cross referencing the the blooms work with the cannon and the themes specifically looking at bodies of work as a whole including the themes And I think there's a 3rd way 3rd way which is simply understanding it through my understanding of myth ending up myth and mythologizing mythologizing I guess with my generation of now here now So there's 3 ways there's blue there's like blooms cannon delete seed myth and and the starthe structuralist model I can do that after I oh I think it is her that reflection in of my voice scared me OK OK what's after that I'm starting to understand that these themes aren't necessarily thecertainly theme is one entity entity like a thing like the American dream is a thing argue it's a concept but then the road task is almost a style For a method of interpretation right I feel like themes can be broken down and thand the dead shit I'm gonna go types of themes and fucking fuck you're me categories gonna of themes or I don't know what fucking flavors a theme and there should only be like 4 Like a theme's palate like no salt sweet you know salt fat and acid basically right nursery types of methods of themes that can be used throughout the storm maybe these 3 types of themes create a robust theme for the flavor where Shakespeare is a fucking bitch ton a theme that flows throughout his entire lexicon like multiple like 10 or 15 and 1 fucking play which is kind of wild to think about it it was the one thing I really stuck with me and I think I'm gonna carry with me Is a blooms theory of the school of resentment and that literature should should be be consumed and for it's us and enjoyed for its esthetic pleasure and that's it did not necessarily as a method to change the society that you currently live in that's not what literature is supposed to be And the way I'm going to take that is that I'm going to write my personal story like my personal perspective and my interpretation of things and if it and you know that doesn't mean I that I don't put a an exhaustive amount of research into certain things into everything I just want to be published because I'm fucking Brown I'll be published because I'm a great author my Angelo was published Though she was a great author she shut her own livid experience what it means to be black to be assaulted and to recover you were covered she isn't published because she was black or woman she was published because she was able to bring to light to to show eloquently and esthetically esthetically and convincingly Portray her own live experience not to pander I think that there's a lot of disservice to her as an author or the way certain things have started to take shape in colleges colleges but anyway that's right another day the day that's about it
