- # Father-Son Bond Over Soviet Military Aircraft Book
- The summary discusses a father buying his son a book about Soviet military aircraft which became the boy's favorite book. The father was actually a MiG-23 pilot but was bothered that the illustration of the MiG-23 was inaccurate. For the boy's birthday, the father took him to meet the author who had a museum of Soviet aircraft. In the bunker was an actual MiG-23 with the accurate pointed nose design. This thrilled the boy. The author and father discussed how the inaccurate drawing was to showcase the failure of the MiG-23 to match the American SR-71. The author suggests the Americans have advanced technology that could cure the boy's poor eyesight and allow him to become a pilot. The narrative explores themes of father-son relationships, Soviet vs American technological competition, and overcoming adversity.
