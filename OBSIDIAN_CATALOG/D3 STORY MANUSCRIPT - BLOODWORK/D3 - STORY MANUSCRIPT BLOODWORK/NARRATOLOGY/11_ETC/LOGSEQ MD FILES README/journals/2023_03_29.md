		- There are 4 distinct authors of the Torah.
		- Documentary Hypothesis
			- The Torah was built from 4 scholarly sources
				- J - Jahwist
				- E - Elohist

			- Leviticus is entirely E
			- Deuteronomy is entirely D

		- Modern Archeology suggests that the bible greatly exaugurated the reign of Judah and a unified monarchy. Theory 2 is an updated understanding.

			- D is the first of authors
			- JE are combined

		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1680133570387_0.png)
			- Theory 3 supposes that the Three Patriarchs and Moses are two separate literary traditions.
			- At some point, Priests decided to combine both.
			- Redactor, R, took the mantle and added Duderodomy and did what he could to make it all make sense
