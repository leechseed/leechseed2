- It's leechy 21 it's just been a while since I've made 181 I'm great I smoked all the weed so that's good it's so that's good so right now we're doing we're doing and and I guess processing the notes I've taken from balloon just to keep you updated I went back and bolded I forgot what the fucking is that his name is like I like Tony something it's not Tony Robbins or something like that but it's part of the tea yes a method where he takes his notes and then he bolden them and highlights them And then after that I think the goal would be for me to summarize them and by summarizing I have I don't mean summarizin no Los Angeles but then I guess my summarizing I will inevitably also be adding my own interpretation as it is to it as well after I summarize them after that will be to go back and recognize trends and identify trends within each one of these note of these summaries and find certain ways to Categorize them in some ways and fine patterns I think the best way I mean there's gonna be several different ways both different ways to organize these things right it would be somewhat of a would you call a non structure database of some sort I think the best way to do it though but I'm looking at it's too kind of attack it as a method of cards of as plain cards as by plain cards I mean like Using magic as in the card game Magic the Gathering as a reference lands types of damage all that shit characters characters and an interesting prospect would be to shuffle these cards and then after that use after that use terror as a way to to draw the cards and unlay them on on a desk to see thematically thematically how how I could thematically create a story through theme right And hopefully through patterns I'd be able to and different sort of different ways of drawing I can yeah create basically to say this is a story and then through that in different methods of displaying those cards and then can go through time that way right I know I would be completely random right possibly I mean But say no 15 books and there are 20 I guess on average fuck it's on average fuck 19 on average are 19 stories per book purple and and um in a way the randomness of it all with all can actually create something and be interesting to do this through for each character right i know here's i think i think theme is probably the most malleable Of each one of the narrative devices like a character almost has I can probably make it that way character has its own formula in a way according to each and you know for each thing you create you can create a new formula for some understand what character is and then you can create the formula and then same thing with location you can understand location and create the formula for location when to create the formula for location then you can plug in the theme and how it represents solving that formula the 1 thing I think I don't want to reduce the formula as my prose and the actual act of creating the art right right the act of making the film right right are the United States I know the recipe for your cooking now the recipe for it but it's not gonna be to say that you're gonna make it exactly the way the book does is bullshit cause when you're cooking shit happens and that's a real life isn't that representation of it like I'll understand what phone making is and I'll have all the tools I know I'm not there yet but anyway that's what I've been doing right now things have been moving pretty fast I mean what's it really just do this whole thing in one day for each of these moves I'm not too sure what What that old until how long it'll take for me to do the summarization parts of it but but I got to take some thinking I still need to figure out how exactly I'm going to display that in log set probably more than overview review then as AA summary at the bottom right there's a thing What I can do is I can classify each type of theme or each type of knowledge of gotten each book as a type of nof acknowledge right go back to what book like there's sequences and there's all that other jazz that's all classified them inferno and for the beyond that I can bring it back in a literature
