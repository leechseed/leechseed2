- Alright let's see it 4124 hours in talk way too much I don't know better all but fuck it I'll sleep for like the next 2 days or something so 2 things 1 I went on github and I think I found a solution for making a dashboard as well as using a note based editing agnostic script I can use anything called dear I'm UI there New a Year million remind dear you a what it's something like that but that I can create these dashboards Relative to what I'm trying to do right because at the end of the day what leech seed is all about is 1st mastering what story is and then automating the bullshit like it's basically just coding and one point and automating it like this it's like almost the unreal engijen for what I'm writing right we're just gonna crazy to think about holy shit it is basically what it is And I think like I can just I'm imagine this timeline at least for plotting a development cautious one Africa who it was is like just called like Tracy something and was she was able to zoom in-and-out like mirror timeline and frame by frame bike Jesus Christ like from the story right I think we're gonna have to do as I went out to figure out like I'm gon to have to have like medium medium module I'm writing a store if I'm writing a novel or accelerate and I'm going to use the figure out what exactly the medium structure so for novels it'll be the fiction textractor I'll be using and I'll have to find a have to use the fucking voice at the knowledge base for that gosh the design design language of this And then and then you know what I can do as I can just once I didn't finish of all the study I can create my 1st thing I probably would do is to create a sort of proto program leech seed to do short stories and from short stories to navellas and navellas to novels and then Once I have the design parameters I can just hopefully plug in whatever narrative medium I wanna put in and plug those in on top of the short of the general paradigm and theory of leech aid which is sort of rooted in reading comprehension sdory I need to start using their names Bloom Hennessy shit McKee Design narrative design guy Alexandra I know I really do want to go into each one of these modules of character theme and all that and just I really needed it like study design theory of where how all these modules sort of like interact with each other and how I can automate that and program that and then display that right and I need to view there's so much interactivity with all of it though it's fucking wild I think we'd mentally I can just 1st do it in excel but it's probably the most relevant or graphical representation of it before putting into this UY before even touched as you are I'll probably want to do it in excel it's only when I start to have like these databases of glossaries and terms and meanings I'll have these modules that I'll be able to put in with it No I think the biggest issue with all this that I'm kind of loosen your femoral part of stor am I or Amy enabling it because I knew what a focus on the creativity and the real part without having to worry about plus positive and negative charges are character Alignments and continuity and I really need to writ like if I can just write it like one of the biggest things that overviews I need to write the trajectory of each film or like my stories and it's understand I need to consistently be aware and self analytical sort of where I am and historically in process because you know I feel like the 1st thing I wouldn't want to do is establish authority authorship And whatever it is like that alright a novel or something or a series even then once I do that is it's as long as I have something to say as McKee says I just need to keep having something that's as long as there's something to say everything else comes from to tell the truth have a truth everything else was behind uh falls behind that I don't even know if I'm I'm not even manic now I'm more like I'd like I don't know if animals just influencing these doubts of Eureka moments you know perhaps perhaps I need to try this withouthe substance more complex than nature what I'm doing I feel like the more stability I need in the real And as scary as it sounds I feel like I don't know what part of it's I have the whole power to do it oh my God even hopefully it's like it's coming together if anything there's a path through the darkness if I do these steps there should be a life and here's the thing Can't give in to early we can't sell to early we've got to hold and hold and give them the final random project because there are so many people who are I feel like with open source the whole point of this is to share and generate information Cathy's really great concepts and ideas but that too often I run into these fucking for profit ventures who take advantage of open source and just buy license and then force people to pay for it and it's just another tool it's a product It's crazy to think about but I feel like a lot of people have no idea what story I don't need to keep that in mind to keep the truth to tell the truth

- Leech seed 440 OK so I finished doing the vocabulary on story and gotta all the way with stuff in it got all the vocab done but I know I just need to write it down and do that vocab pass for a little highlighting I think I'm gonna try and do right now as really trying nail down a sintroductory system ai initiating system to inflow sort of I don't know stories that I want to develop right so I've already got the kind of idea concept it out I know the topos like there's topos and then there's a controlling idea and then the idea of the values plus and minus and then inciting incident and then the climax I think I want I feel like I'd be really easily jotted down what those negative once I got those opposite negative values And then on top of that I also do the arch the surface text and the body text body butt air but a certa surface text and yeah the body of the text text Bobby my intent right I think what I what's good to do is then what once I take actually I'll take those 3 levels at The topos and the controlling idea and the character I guess I'd have been protagonist also practice controlling idea the 3 of those and then I'm then I have to run those 3 in the system of the comprehension matrix whatever you call the 3 levels of comprehension the surface text this subtext and the infrared so it's basically what is written And understood literally what it means and the interpretation or what they think it means of the audience or what the reader thinks meand in my intent so I need to do a different perspective of me writing of the again it's just like authorial in tent is a very odd thing to me because I don't really know what I'm telling this I'm a theory that there is a story in the truth And do I think Mickey put this on well to start out with the intention that you're going to say something as wrong so instead of saying I need to attack it like not showing from my perspective as an author when I is a reader and an observer to the story itseoff I just came up with a really cool title and subtitle for MX86 finding MX86 Cullen finding the shame in the pleasure machine And I don't know if I want to go back and see my previous notes on the mixed 86 where do I want to attack a kind of from a new fresh respective I know it's more just like an exercise sort of wbut the idea of topos controlling idea and yeah this is temperature controlling ideand then the controlling ideas broken up into the positive and negative charges right Different characters also represent from the topos there is different characterizations I can take that from Bloom and each one of those characters are represented in the universal themes God damn it all these fucking vocabulary so here's my thing I think the topos can be split into 3 as well right cause I've already done that way cross reference ring comprehension book is that the tuppos has 3 layers as well it has the overt Literal text that is written and a sort of understood which is the end the connector where the connector where the conjunction of and so would be sin and redemption or and one of those and then tsecondary the subtextual theme the subtextual theme is sin and redemption they the the conductor that the conjunction theme and then above that is the Service text which means grotesque et cetera the I've have it in the thing right and I've been can give me multiple I think and it's a sort of this layered idea of when you have cause it's almost like John ra and there's not OK and John wrote a kind of encapsulates the whole thit's really interesting actually don'tobos yeah I want you to illustrate where tobos is coming from tobo's controlling idea I don't I need to define the 3 layers of topo or the 2 layers of tobos Jesus Christ fuck do you just gonna be I just want to use vocabulary already Built-in so I want to use vocabulary so I can tie it in to rain comprehension so it'll be send text topos in the sub topos And then after that we will then take that and then consider a controlling idea the controlling surface idea of that with consideration the esthetic almost the controlling surface idea is grotesque assorted so-and-so and then the sub tobos would be it controlling that idea would be whatever the protagonist is What to do
