- Alright let's see you at 15 in sin and redemption was the last blue book I did I did also did some research on how to get published just because I was bored I needed something to assist simulate me just some lay person bullshit and how to write a proposal letter or whatever one page bullshit bullshit I believe the best thing to do is to get some recognition 1st maybe do some trying to get published in the journal Scholarly bullshit win some awards then maybe get an agent because it's just really fucking hard to do an open call you know you're 01/01/2000 as lady said and of all of them shipping one out of 2000 dude and after she publishes this in a book how to do it I'm just gonna make the difference it's a different so what you do you put odds in your favor generate your recognition anyway send in redemption Very interesting thing that Bloom said is that blooms said is a synonym redemption are theological components and not themes what is a theme as error and recognition basically doing something wrong or that was bad and then recognizing you made that error and how that character moves on beyond that there's a lot of fucking theological bullshit that he Springs around in the novels of so much Western literature is influenced by Christianity it's my Christianity it's crazy The idea of Adam-and-Eve and God original original sin and AAA lot of um really how do I put it a dogmatic works in the past that I don't think necessarily would fly today which is crazy to think about because a lot of things should fly today you're certain things you're just not allowed to talk about and if you do don't be God that judges you are smart too It's everyone it's people I think I'd like to learn a lot about what similar redemption is in legacy today's modern societies that you're so fickle fickle when you ever have to create something or put yourself out there especially something else especially controversial but you know people will be you know people will be bipolar on Leader love you although call for your head on a Pike I don't think I'm trying to be and rander anything but there's just nothing of substance it makes you feel a little more emotion rather than hate unhate or infatuation there is no common ground what did you do Appeal to one side simply except the fact that yeah that you would people will call you a grifter because you write about something that's obviously polarizing basically polarizing or you brave at that point you'd have to put up the argument of the argument of if you're learning to learn if you're learning too amazing books Fiction deliver everyday life or to interpret the real world then I think there's something much more uncomfortable uncomfortable with that conversation Tennessee Williams has this idea of the anti hero the modern anti hero where he struggles Not like the Aristotelian which he sees as a it's a artifact of what the hero is because the rest of town in heroes vary outwardly acti will leave action and doing an appearance while anti hero is more concerned about his place in the world and in pain while one hero is is looking for or an appointment the other 1 is Coping he also said something abouto say something about a characters are er a character is a I'm scared of Ava pieces pieces of characters one character is never a whole it's always a collection of multitudes enough multitudes of character types that's what the whole life that's mask thing is everyone it's all masks dumb-ass different masks they're wearing it isn't necessarily how The character is more of the psycho vessel of humanity at homenergy how we felt in certain situations and and how I we feel that we should act not necessarily what this character would do in terms of tension what not it's more of an honest interpretation Asian what's the embodiment of theme and what like that purpose of that character is and what they're embodying they're like that vessel again they're embodied at the aren't people are so perracted by the vessel that told the soul for the soul It's what true character is you can tie that the theme controlling idea and all that jazz I don't know what else to say other than tomorrow is the sublime which I think is the one thing that I've heard fucking everywhere and each 1 of the books previously he has mentioned the Herald Bloom has mentioned the fucking sublime so I really need to fucking take that And dove deep into it and I hope it isn't too dense hope there's a lot more descriptive what authors believe supply is not necessarily how they used to supply I would like you to sublime and everything that's it
