	- so there's a concept i've been fuxxing with
	- the idea of using dualism as the cornerstone of my research methodology
		- also the idea of quantum states of research
			- (perhaps stretched to the concept of the mind itself....being a corporeal yet ethereal entity at the same moment...the instant thoughts, actions, ideas, etc are expressed in the corporeal realm of  reality they become existential in the ontological sense)
			- what if conscientiousness is a conduit between two dimensions that are otherwise existentially driven apart?
			- the rules that govern the two  realities are manifest based one universal otherwise immaterial truth that by nature is not to the other.
			- Binary Poles of Reality that exist in an entire...simply put....opposite of the other
			- not like opposite day where one of earth
				- stands on a chair instead of sits on it
			- but opposite as in the fundamental and microscopic units of reality are the opposite charge of existence to the other.
			- I guess as an analogy
				- Imagine reality is a game engine that at its highest level is reduced to the machine language of binary
				- If 100111001 - was lest say a fish in *Chat*
				- 011000110 - wtf would this be in *Tuppy*
				- *__Chat__* - world that represents the Universe of Real (earth)
				- *__Tuppy__* - world that represents the Tailswish (alternate umiverse)
