- Lead sheet 46 not too much progress recently kind of sucks but I feel like I have to chalk in some months off the chat parents are at home how much you do very difficult to sucks ax I am hoping to finish McKee though I know I think what I can do is to take advantage of this sort of love and things to One finished machine then after that I can perhaps go back into bloum sort of break that down I found a way to break down things into models but I don't know where to put so much goddamn information I think the goal will be do have that sort of I didn't make that model of the top 4 sort of overarking larger larger concepts of stprobably I can I slightly break them down into those just make the models and put them like logs like it is kind of winning down it's sort of gold for me like it's good for taking notes and shit but there I don't know what to do when it comes to just putting it all together It's not like documents or whatever I think what I can do is definitely just break it down to process I feel like perhaps perhaps some alarm might be the key here terms of breaking things down a lot of water Mcgee is just teaching what stuff is right but what I really want to know from him and his strategies I think what I can do is I can use the basis of a book like one of those maybe there's dummy books as a basis for a start of formatting my knowledge that could be a good idea not sure that's a great idrop some of the dummy books One of the dummy books or Shelby palar remember another book that has a to do to go type thing like a process type thing maybe I can look into that tonight definitely would like to finish Mickey tonight too W gold probably a goal just in this holding pattern that's just uncomfortabut I'm not a partner that we've done jacket done it's about it basically
