- # Update on the Bible effort
	- ## Code is now the Radiolaria
		-
		  > "Radiolaria" is a taxonomic group of marine microorganisms that have intricate mineral skeletons, which are often composed of silica and have a distinct radial symmetry. The name "Radiolaria" is derived from the Latin word "radius," meaning "ray," and refers to their intricate skeletal structures that resemble spines, horns, or spheres arranged in a symmetrical pattern.  
		- The Radiolaria represents the stakeholders in LEECHSEED
		-
	- ## The Dichronovisor (Dicron/div/DCV)
	  id:: 642a539b-8798-42a5-b013-4e4f57ec8cb8
		- The **Dichronovisor** (DCV) is the necessary device that must be equipped to enter LEECHSEED.
		- The DCV is comprised of three components.
			- ### The **Archetopos Manifold**
				-
				  > In Greek, "arch" (ἀρχή) means "beginning," "origin," "rule," or "leadership." It is often used as a prefix in English to indicate something that is first in rank, importance, or time.  
				-
				  > The Greek word "arche" (ἀρχή) is also used in philosophy, where it refers to the first principles or underlying foundations of knowledge, as well as in physics, where it refers to the fundamental laws or principles governing the behavior of matter and energy.  
				- represents a fork from Bloom's Themes
				- Theme is a concept that is woven into every decision made in Leechseed.
				- It is the oxygen that breathes life into the Leechseed and whatever it creates.
				- It is represents the philosophy that theme is not a component of narrative, but the bedrock in which story is built upon.
			- ### **Copenhagen's Vague Interpreter** - LEARNING - LEECHING
				-
				  > The debate over the role of the observer in quantum mechanics is a topic of ongoing discussion and controversy in philosophy, physics, and other fields. At the heart of this debate is the question of whether the act of observation or measurement actually causes the collapse of the wave function, or whether it is simply a matter of interaction between the quantum system and its environment.  
				-
				  > Some philosophers and physicists have proposed alternative interpretations, such as the "many-worlds interpretation," which suggests that the wave function never actually collapses, but instead branches off into multiple parallel universes, each corresponding to a different possible outcome of the measurement.  
				- Copenhagen's Vague Interpreter (CVI) is rooted in the narrative concept of duality.
				- The CVI allows the user to envision **dualities of nature** otherwise known as **dilemma** that **exist in a quantum state**
				- EG: There is a pot on the stove. It is either hot/not.
					- However, as a user, we are unable to observe any empirical evidence of the pot's state.
					- The next logical step to take is for the non-equipped DCV user to jump from empirical observation to theoretical and speculative thinking.
					- While the pot on the stove is rudimentary, it demonstrates the function of the CVI.
				- Dilemma's exist at various states of quality. However, LEECHSEED is only capable of functioning with dilemma's that are in  a **quantum catalytic state**
				- Using the example of the stove pot. The example is in fact in a quantum catalytic state.
				- When observing the stove pot example with the CVI's validizer display will read: DQCS-V
					- DQCS-V: Dilemma Quantum Catalytic State - Valid
				- In other circumstances, the CVI's validizer may display other conditions.
					- **D-V: Dilemma Valid**
					- **DQ-V: Dilemma Quantum Valid**
					- **CS-V: Cataclysmic State Valid**
				- #### D-V:  Dilemma-Valid recognizes a sample as a dilemma.
					- A dilemma is an **isomeric decision** that when observed, collapses into **consequential alpha decay**.
					- The minimum state in which decisions are derived, actions executed, and consequences rise.
					- **isomeric decision** - the phenomenon in which a decision exists in two different **kinojudicatic** states. As opposed to a simple decision.
					- **Isomer** - two or more different states
					- **consequential decay** - when a dilemma collapses from decision to action, it creates a phenomenon where **kinojudicatic energy** radiates into the surrounding narrative.
					- Consequential decay may influence decisions that occur within the narrative known as **collateral foreshadowing**
					- However, D-Vs are initially classified as low-kinojudicatic energy types, therefore the probability of collateral foreshadowing is little to none.
					- **consequential alpha decay** - the low-kinojudicatic energy decay unique to D-Vs that can result in **superficial foreshadowing**.
					- **foreshadowing** - a signal of events or outcomes to occur in the future narrative
						- **superficial foreshadowing** - a signal of events or outcomes that does not affect the narrative directly, but may be used to enrich the quality of the narrative using superficial narrative devices.
						- **collateral foreshadowing** - a signal of events or outcomes that affect nature beyond the narrative
				- #### Dilemma Quantum-Valid recognizes a sample as a D-V of **opposing** states that when observed, captures kinojudicatic energy resulting in the formation a DQ-V.
					- When a  DQ-V is enriched with kinojudicatic energy and reaches close to cataclysmic state, the DQ-V will emit **consequential beta decay**.
					- A DQ-V is an intermediated decision state that can be enriched and collect 'stacks' of **parasykic** D-Vs.
					- **Opposing** - on a spectrum of states, 'opposing' notes two values of equal and opposite nature.
					- **parasykic** - D-Vs made in **voydik** contextuality.
					- **voydik**- of or relating to theoretical, speculative, intuitive thinking.
					- **consequential beta decay** - a form of consequential decay that has much more energy than alpha decay and ensures collateral foreshadowing in the narrative.
				- #### Dilemma Quantum Cataclysmic State-Valid recognizes a sample of a DQ-V has evolved into a QCS-V state that when observed, collapses releasing a tragic amount of kinojudicatic energy in the form of violence and **consequential gamma decay**
					- **violence** - a process in which sentient life purges kinojudicatic energy from the body. Collected over time thru consequential decay or acute exposure to a **parasykic series**.
					- The certain conditions that a dilemma must meet to validate the as QCS-V
					- **parasykic series** - A sequential number of D-V collapses in voydik contextuality to a DQ-V
					- **consequential gamma decay** - a phenomenon of high kinojudicatic energy release radiating over time. Results in collateral foreshadowing and affect insurmountable to the narrative and beyond.
			- ## Voydik-Coagulative Vision - SEEDING - UNDERSTANDING
				- Traits necessary to utilize the DCV.
				- One must be voydik, open to imaginative and play-like interpretation of science and empirical aesthetics.
				- One must be coagulative, understand that LEECHEED is a method of narrative practice coupled with concepts of a Unified Modeling Language.
				- If pursued solo, then bound only by your mind's understanding.
				- If pursued as a team, then focus on mutual understanding, for that leads to the ultimate goal of a raid team: gangbang energy.
