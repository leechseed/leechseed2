- Alright so let's see 28 I just finished the scene part of the Mickey book talking about ax structure but i like about is that it's undo's a lot of some principles that i worked with recently is that act 3 acts is simply a principle it's not a requirement and got the 5 extra sew and went not and wiped to go up the firebacks you're a second actor is is a trash between dad and morax You know either with sublots or more action or more reversals this is really interesting that's kind of all he really talked about that old fucking takes a lot to explain certain things multiplatch oh yeah I have an idea of how multiplatch can be leave into a novel how multiple it's can be used to sort of mood or the idea of a certain area We're certain place environment I kind of already did that with Jack in the cruise it's a very up there's certain parts where I branch off and I go follow certain people cause I was establishing the sort of idea in the environment Jackie was almost hours to rewrite that a jackie's almost one of the many protagon are not even a protagonist but a individual characters in the multiply it kind of is already it's very Internal conflict though very inside interior it's a stream of conscience it's not very much of a screen play ask but that's just an idea let's see here the antiplied I don't even want to talk about that this is dumb his one thing I kind of disagree with McKee is I guess this is good for a beginning writer 1 who's really just trying to grasp the idea what story is is you want to reduce the amount of when talking about conflict there's 3 types of conflict interior Exterior in societal so like interior is like of the mind exercise like physical action and societals a 3rd layer and of course they can go and different met ways like societal can be environmental you know you can put a lot of things into each one of those compartments but that's basically the idea is that you want to bridge all 3 types of conflict eventually into the stone thing I really Was a cool part of inside is that when it comes to sub plots and multi supply it's a multiple supply so you can use their sort of sequenced reversal as many what the hell they say at climaxes within act one activate and you can like bisect a slow 2nd act by having the climaxes of a secondary plot or a tertiary plot kind of bridge over that is interesting what I like is that it's now the stories becoming a lot more I'm not I'm actually able to see it anyway that I'm able to assemble a lot of the components togather how a lot of supplies can enter informs of counter controlling ideas something that go against the controlling idea and that sort of place with the main controlling idea gonna be like an attack at a force of antagonist plot that can go counter to the main controlling idea characters block major block Nothing I really like nothing I realized is that if you're going to write an 80 minute 80 at least scene hunt you film need hundreds you need of different variations to come to the right one and like I'm able to use this idea of variations and submit these variations into like what do you call a what do you call a vegetarians in terms of what the inputs are and the different types of variations per plot point per to reversal per act rememberable scene et cetera and a lot of stuff is just starting to come together which feels pretty cool a plot seems like something I really struggled with and I'm glad it didn't really deep dive into a plot book what I did is I went to this overarching plot book which kind of helps me know a lot of these blendalities areas that already know about And put some together and it shows how theme is a major major major point like it's probably one of the most central points of it but it's still a very small part of the whole thing it's like the engine to a cruise ship a power is a propeller but there are some other things which make that a pretty shit you know it that's it
