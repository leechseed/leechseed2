- # Division 2 - Brilliant Mission Design
- ## Federal Bunker final boss fight
- ### Some big ass final boss is beating on a clear plate glass door.
- #### clearly its bullet proof, cause this hunk-a-junc wailing at it for feels like seven fortnights
- Meanwhile, you're stuck behind this console fighting off adds wondering  when that fuck is gonna break thru, cause shit is gonna turnt up a sec in a bit.
- Its a brilliant use of Mckee's 'obligatory scene' mechanic.
- The audience, aka you the player, know what eventually is going to happen.
- Bad mothafucka is gonna come in.
- But you don't know when.
- Additionally, you have the threat of adds coming at you wave, after wave, stronger and stronger.
- Is he going to come in when they're on top of me?
- Is he going to come in when I'm prepared?
- # additionally this is a great illustration of an obligatory stack mechanic.
- ## stacking obligatory scenes together can deepen the gap between now and the obligatory
- ### lets say, we're 'running out of ammo'
- #### since we are alone, and taking advantage of the 'show don't tell shit' we can illustrate this by having linked ammo, draped around our shoulders, travel around our body, almost like armor, like a train of power feeding into our one weapon, the M60.
- The ammo, a source of power, slowly is depleting.
- The ammo, a source of protection, illustrated by, lets say, Saving Private Ryan Style, is deflecting bits of debris from collateral damage caused by the firefight.
- Sharp fragments of concrete exploding off nearby pillars, lacerating wounds on god but 7.62 be the devil's shield.
- # so at this point, we have 3 stack obligatory.
- ## the adds, the boss, and the ammo.
- ### notice the relational nature of the 3 obligs.
- #### hierarchical - in terms of 'result of death'
- 1 - the most threatening - the adds - is the primary - thru overwhelming violence
- 2 *- the second - running out of ammo -*
- 3 - the third - big boi
- *who* is going kill me?
- #### temporal - in terms of 'result of death'
- 1 - adds - wave after wave, the eventuality, this will kill me.
- 2 - running out of ammo - when i run out, this will eventually kill me.
- 3 - the third - or, additionally, this will eventually kill me
- *when* am i going to die?
- #### emotional - where am i going to die
- 1 - i am going to die in this fucking sewer
- 2 - deep existential dread
- 3 - reactionary - character dependent, perhaps use perspective of psych to deepen this oblig
- *how does this make me feeeeel?*
- # Each one of these obligs are used to support the mechanic of ratchet tension and theatric engagement
- ## However, thru the values of LEECHSEED, dualities and topos can should be the primary oblig build
- #### we can build out from this point tho, u kno wut i'm sain?
-
  > *2 - the second - running out of ammo*  
- we can take 2, and make it an equation for an oblig we can set up and reinforce earlier in the plot
- **scarcity** - can be a primary and higher level topos
- **topos of scarcity** = *abundance* and *hardship*
- on top of this, **a pattern emerges from the voydic**
- # the enemy is abundance
- ## the waves of suicidal g00ns. overwhelming eventual death
- ### devouring hunger of the abundant hoard
- #### where pleasure is not pursued but survival, because there is no survival in less than the grotesque
- but ourselves, the hero, the great, the good, the wise, and the virtuous, are in *hardship*
- this hardship and scarcity specifically through this one specific oblig, *ammo,* can be illustrated in an earlier scene.
- we are always consistently *searching* for ammunition.
- of course, we can stretch this oblig into another, but not as powerful, but in terms of quantity all its own...
- famine and *the need to feed* to survive
- # thus an obligatory irony emerges
- ## our enemy is much like us. the search. the need. to survive.
- #### however, the human, the decent, and the superficial ez to understand overwhelming must use topos at all times righteousness vs evil is.........
- # the enemy succumbs to the path of hedo.
- ## the hero commits to the void of righteousness.
- #### pleasure and spoil
- #### adroit and hysteria
- # evil is to rob one or many the choice of the path and the void
- ## evil can manifest from either the path and the void
- #### thru spoil or hysteria
- # DUALITY MANIFEST
- ## TOPOS THEMATIC
- ### YEETUS MCFEETUS
- #### MY ASS SHATTUS MY SHEETUS
