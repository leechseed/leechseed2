- Narratology is the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that these affect our perception. It's a sub-discipline of literary theory that was developed in the 1960s. Here are some of the key concepts of narratology:
- 1. **Narrative**: Any structured sequence of events or story. Narratives can be found in literature, film, history, and other forms of communication.
- 2. **Narrator**: The entity through which a story is told. Narrators can be first-person, second-person, or third-person, and can be characterized in terms of their reliability, intrusiveness, and subjectivity.
- 3. **Diegesis and Mimesis**: Diegesis refers to the narrative world, and mimesis refers to the representation of the story. A diegetic element is part of the story world (like dialogue), whereas a mimetic element represents the story (like a descriptive passage).
- 4. **Plot and Story (Fabula and Syuzhet)**: The plot (Syuzhet) is the actual sequence and manner in which events are presented in the narrative, whereas the story (Fabula) is the chronological sequence of events as they occurred in the world of the story.
- 5. **Characters**: The individuals portrayed in a narrative, they are distinguished by their traits, roles, and functions within the story.
- 6. **Point of View**: The perspective from which a story is told. This can involve considering the narrative voice, focalization (who sees), and perspective (who speaks).
- 7. **Time**: Narratology examines the treatment of time in narrative, including order (the sequence of events), duration (the pacing of events), and frequency (how often events are told).
- 8. **Narrative Levels**: This refers to the different layers of narrative within a story. For example, a main story might contain a secondary story or stories within it (hypodiegesis).
- 9. **Narrative Modes**: This refers to the different ways a story can be conveyed, including telling (narrative voice), showing (dramatic enactment), and a combination of both.
- 10. **Intertextuality**: The relationship between one text and others that surround it, either directly or indirectly.
- 11. **Closure**: The concept deals with how narratives end and how they resolve (or don't resolve) the tensions they've built up.
- 12. **Genres and Archetypes**: Narratology also studies the recurring types or categories of narratives and the archetypal stories, characters, or themes they might contain.
- 13. **Metanarrative**: This refers to narratives about narratives, examining the ways in which storytelling functions as a theme within the story itself.
- 14. **Functions and Actions**: Certain actions or functions of characters that drive the narrative forward, such as Vladimir Proppâ€™s analysis of Russian folk tales.
- 15. **Cultural Narratology**: This broadens the scope of traditional narratology to consider the cultural contexts and non-textual aspects of narrative.
- Understanding these concepts can allow a reader or scholar to dissect and analyze a narrative in a more structured and insightful way.
