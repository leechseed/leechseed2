- Let's eat 80 eigha ha I'll study for the week hopefully the next 6 days I'll be quick to get the idea now I'll just to get on destiny and game it out and go to bed I don't know if I'm gonna go to bed I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna go to bed I don't know I don't but I have know hopefully if I'm gonna set go to bed I don't know if I'm gonna go to bed I don't know I'm gonna go to bed I the don't Force know myself I don't know but brought my brother on board been really helping out with the data stack next thing I'm planning to do is use just a really hammered down the architecture The database make sure everything is complete and succinit's a saint I think what I want to do is first compile all the relevant data defy it all and data map each schema and then compile into one sort of database systems document there are probably handed off to my brother probably want some start an edible form edit bubble form somehow to Edit it probably put it in a rent view or something maybe just a Word document that's probably the best thing we do and then have each for a document then be separate something like that are you the best thing for him to do is just to edit it actually with circles and all that jazz and then I'll take it back and then I think once I get this database as I document Di feel like that's when I'll move on to the Web server thing Most of it because I really just don't wanna leave this alone yethat's why my most pertinent and focus right now then get on the lamp then what's a getting lamp then maybe start and get comfortable with lamp then start the build maybe just increase the complexity of the from there what's another bottle lamp Maybe the bill on top of that maybe I'll learn different data software stacks perhaps but regardless that's sort of where I'm wanting to go and the more I think about it the more I feel like I need to build a new PC simply because I'm really put behind by my CPU sounds relax and upgrade I have to go with a whole new architecture for my motherboard Plus it's just fine see you here I probably wanna I don't know i'd probably just doing a torture typical stack but the whole idea about the hardware is hothere's still a lot you know there's a database and then there's a gun there's the actual server to write it all on I think I do use that I would want to rack I don't know where to put it knowledge like that's an office at that point Yeah That's you know that's a super future but heatly I would just need a Easy sort of technology focused I'm glad I'm glad I probably toss could just It all on Amazon really I'm not have to look about opposite and All That shit but until Then I think I'll Be OK excited from that read downloading Destiny 2 I think what else I can do today is shit the terror was limited and it's website upload which is fine I guess however I would like that back I'm only $20 a year for 2 gigs so I think that's like do I have 2 gigs of data right now Don't you hear put it in a rent view or something maybe just a Word document I don't really want to conceptualize and really solidify a sort of data processing procedure just yet I feel like everything should be centered around the database that's that's what it I'll see hair books in the process how big do this 88 gigs Jesus Christ dudes of terror will not be able to handle that If anything what I'll do is I'll probably jupdate it thgoogle drive is what I think is the best option here I'll go through Google Drive I'll periodically update it using that basically II don't need to have a Certificate of itself be the date LA the la back up But out of there I need a 100 gigs dude how much I have right now cancel perhaps I should look into what what my Brother was talking about another database system because because She this is a terrorist kind of slow for the amount of The amount of data I'm working with let's see here this is just a lot man still a lot you know there's a database and then there's a gun there's the actual server to write it all on I think I do use that I would want to rack I don't know where to put it no it's like that's an office at that point

- Late seed 86 was able to finally figure out how to consolidate and quote a good sort of my notes from my analyzer with log sec dancing powerful insight with it once I owe it one of which is that I really didn't start being productive with the program untilavallette 6 months ago 1 have had it for maybe about a year a little over a year is whand I really started sort of take A liking to it to create a sort of formal flow to it's interesting to note that because now I always felt like locksec isn't enough and I was not thinking about switching to another program which I'm back to obsidian and now achieving that inside I realized that that would be a mistake personally because I don't only start to kick in really at least for my last year's behavior until not about 6 months and then I'll have 6 months to work with it and then I'll want to switch again No this is all I did just do a queer reso by the way that doesn't mean I don't think I should start implementing obsidian the problem is I think I really need to retack all and re conceptualize the issue I'm having right now with loxack it's being able to while the problem I'm trying to tackle it is to gain insight and to gain some things that I can turn into sort of more I'll try to see if anything in the past that everyone can actually means something you know if it's actually worth keeping and if it's worth keeping I want it Take it and I want to turn it into real life paperwork I want to turn it into white paper I want to turn it into something that I can reference as this is real shit but I'm building everything off of righow do I do that through the method of patterns but there's something I definitely should the idea of what patterns are and and I got the first part of answering that question down and that's being able to sort of sort all these journals right cause I didn't know how many I had Over a 1000 I didn't know how far back in time I wanted to actually start at writing in what relevant on top of that like locksmith wasn't quick to actually do it and I think that's what the biggest thing is with oxygen that's frustrating me is that it's not fast as it wants to claim tothe inside I guess I'm coming from that if this lock sec uses graphs as its form of databasing and what it uses and the logical connectors between them right and that's how they define those connections The Thing is it's not really that fat Bitch until it gets the scale is when it starts 2 be really frustratingly slow and you're going to have to find ways to work around it which I did and it being a program that's developed open source wise without any decent documentation a lot of people who are grifting off of it for Money it's Really hard to Find the Answer that You WANT and unfortunately not being around a Long Time You have a chat to be T which You Really can't work off of and THat Part was frustrating but of course our work around and hopefully I Found one for this That's a call at least I think part way to it for now the idea is to go and sort through these colonel's who's chubby and I think what it went to do look at that Papa who's Paul paul Bowie poopy bowie it's to Then Go through them by these months that I've sorted and copy and paste the Money I would like the each block into another note I don't want to deal with these notes then take those notes and then create a pattern from each one of them and say butt butt butt butt butt and then that block will become the pattern from that block I'll bring it into the city or I'll bring it to rent me actually I don't need to send any from there I'll be able you do get the documentation that I need I'm just great you know hopefully there will be some good stuff And there you know be nice of course your complicates things but complicates things is what complicates think you know the theme part is gonna be it I think um but I really think I really kind of have it down aren'tistic conceptualize and put it in like as for right now 2022 was a year theme is about to sleep in the night when the year theme I understand what theme is and it's part of the one thing I know actually Completely after that it's I don't know I really think I do have the idea of story in my head when it comes to some patterns and I think that's what I can do is take patterns and start to finding them don't do my head are loose and then turning it into documentation I'll figure out how it all works later but that's what it's gonna be inside of the whole thing it's about it
