			- My goal is to have an aesthetic gape with a regular and non aggressive maintenance routine.
			- Secondary goal is to simply cross the barrier to entry when it comes to popular large toy brands like baddragon and uberrime.
			- following these guidelines I came to the hypothesis that the XXL with circ 9" is fits within that range. Of course this can change once doing more research into BD and other toys.
			- Although not mandatory, it would be nice to remove one more toy to allow for more liquidity for the tertiary objective
			- tertiary objective - create a comfortable, practical, aesthetic, and discreet playscape.

			- I looked at the blunts, what makes these interesting is that they fit nearly perfect intermediaries between the eggs.  perhaps training could be bolstered by passive stretching by using blunts in between.
			- This is the final progression I've decided on
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1680561793655_0.png)
			- In total, **Six Weeks, One Plug Per Week** would be the full routine.
			- However, I can see myself **cutting that time in half** in terms of progression, and spending more time with the maintenance plugs.

	- Wait till you get 59 working on sting on developing the strange method the strange keeper is method and basically I'm using the strange keeper as a label for me and what I like about using these labels is opposed to saying me or I when the author is that in it it prompts it prompts mind the to understand the concept of depth And when I can add that to the the model took the process of the computer of a process to understand things that it keeps that as ad's activity is analysis and turn of conclusion right the more I think about it the human mind is that is A processor right in it references experience and knowledge and it to create ideas and new things and fresh think autumn eats part of that mind and I think it's important though to 1st develop a part of the mind I really think it's important to know how to read and to know how to read a book manually because only then you're able to sort of grade the value and the quality Of the output of the system though the black Box system of chat GBT when it's feeding back to you what summary of basically what you've been reading and it's always good because then you're still in control right it's I think the biggest understanding the biggest thing with Chappie TGPT is like with any powerful tools to understand the limitations of that tool and of yourself and one thing I fell into earlier when using the tool is the idea and never liability that I had it almost do everything for me I asked a question to this this is the best that then the office on becomes a overload of information just like a lesson learned with the Internet that it took me maybe years I learned 1/2 a second the thing is took me a minute to sort of realize that I'm just I had this moment again and over and over and over again in my life and so that's always able to figure out I need a backout and then go again somewhere else and I think that's one thing I need to learn I'm learning right now when I am The ivory journal again with the prompting depth the ivory journo I I've integrated chat VT by basically doing the own process of cleaning and marking up the text so I can then ingested into chat GPT and what I realized is like at 1st thing the biggest lesson that need to learn from that is when I've known I've done the difficult process of understanding what it does and then creating a systematic process to execute Efficiently what I'm supposed to do and what I've done that I think that's what I need to move on and then not continue to do that time 2nd of a process because I can do that later it's more important that I value the mental state or like demi what you call it my cognitive abilities to then put it somewhere else that I can then as long as I horse like the Cav out of that is that effect forget how to do it and I think to take care of that what I'll do is that with that process I've put at the very bottom Oath of the less I have to do today is to start making to do another book and that's why I was talking about a minute ago was the strange keeper book a strange keeper's book as all about how how high as a process in yes relevant information and shit and then process it through ai and chat you BT then output it to a point where I understand what it is I'll be able to summarize it and then I'll be able to then transform that information and add it to other information that already know and generate new ideas and clever and deep ideas
	- That I then you know makes my value of my ideas even more valuable so to speak right I'm basically creating a depth chart of value of what I do and for me I think that the whole point of this is because I'm a leveraging what makes me and my ideas unique like I'm able to take the the ideas that I tell people and they once had a million million milliliters instantly come up with I'm unable to run it through Ali's deep and pervasive systems to create and to create what I believe is true literature and that's literature that is still able to be processed Hundreds of years later from when it was written like Shakespeare will still be Shakespeare despite chat to be tabing around and being able to analyze it and then we created why because Shakespeare inspired that right and I think that's what I want to do if I'm writing it's to have the modern take that what I'm doing to do what Shakespeare did back then Jesus Christ Stuart how did he fucking do it it's a kind of innocent guy who's 11 guy and holy shit anyway I think it's intention was not to entertain people hundreds of years in the future I think what intention was was to be the best at what he was doing And I don't need it at this time and the way he understood what his best is he understood anybody's audience and they're a locus of information and what he was able to inspire him to be the best of who he can be at that time he was at the edge of his technology everywhere right I think that's what makes him different than me and any other individual at there is certain point in history of humanity is that they're at a point at the Derek Larry at the edge of the human experience or have the capability of living life at the edge of the human experience at that particular time and right now There's a to be at the edge of that experience without one Of course I can build it down now that I think about it to what I want people to have is a rich experience a rich and more experience I want them to have a more nuanced rich and exciting life through experiensing a rich nuance an exciting story through design and through doing what a lot of people fail to understand what failed to do and that'stand shit like to Able to really dedicate yourself not to the money not to the end goal not to the social reward reward for being coronaque successful and it's not reaching and grabbing success as soon as possible to reap those rewards I think that's a lot of people are doing what it is they're going for really quick stuff but then that quick but things it's really easy to say that but also it's a very fuzzy concept in
	- the fact that The idea of the balance between the thematic islands and topos of success in the modern age and wanting that success it's how badly do you want it and how ignorant do you have to be to do a ticket at 2 o'clock right the more you wan to access the more stupid you are I think that's thing it's not wanting it it's it's success is about the methodology right it's going to happen eventually it's a state that is decided not for you but by the external world and it's not you that aside if you're successful Because when you decide you're successful you're you're surrounded you the mind is smart but if pointed in the wrong direction it will be fucking stupid as at 1 "Africa who it was said it is if you are successful if you think you're successful then you're surround yourself with symbols of success because that to you is what success is and did you have that conceiving your mind and not focused on what your purpose is and what your values are and what you're not necessarily even fulfillment like a film into the nothing I want to feel fulfilled from my perspective fulfillment Success all of that shit means nothing to purpose and meaning as long as that means something it means there's reason to get up and if fulfillment it's also so vetype of materiality rather than something something I think as indefinable in a sense that I was it's meant to be enigmatic or it's meant to be a very nuanced concept of meaning and purpose and it's so unique to a person I think so unique too It makes everything else so much more doable as when you have a purpose and you have meaning and like part of that purpose of meeting the tangible part of it is you know the most tangible is that value that purpose that you reduce down to what your mission is when it comes to business and patience for me is another biggest thing it's like I am willing anything that's my whole thing that's why I did if I had brands like Ferrari no I'm a Guinea but Ferrari Some of the car brands well that's really it really mean hasn't Martin I guess but I value the product more than anything and ask in martin's products on that great Porsche actually they're more of a mess right OK so I wonder what a reference here is the purpose in the meaning of and then how different how people have a different meaning to something but then achieving that meaning is our purpose and through that purpose they have their products and what not it's cause I feel like Porsche and us said Ferrari havari Similar meanings in life for themselves but they reach it this certain way and that's a new one's aspect of it like you can't find brands with the same meaning and you're the same when that person who'll find like not if I hate you in the world fulfillment but they're find meaning purpose a like a way I feel like the having a strong mathematic meaning is so much more valuable and so much more of a resilient and robust cornerstone to the architecture or something complex Because it also is a guiding principles for cotton I'm sorry to gotta print but it as long as you understand why you're able to configure out everything else our prioritization wise right and I think that's something that chapped UPT is struggling with because it's a tool it's not a sentient thing anyway alright I could go on another shit so sweet you can break but I'm I think I'm gonna stop where I am when it comes to filling out The shit a chapter 2 because there's 20 and we're trying to have to do but it's such a long slag but I know what to do like even if I look at it I can reference my memory I don't have to write it down even right I think I will write something down but I don't have to go so in depth to wear it's a slock is that can be done later it's almost that type of mindful effort is different than the sort of design of it right there it's when you're vision vision visioning so there's like vision and then there's Planning right and then I'm gonna throw that planning or sort of harassing your kind of setting the boundaries of expectation setting the boundaries and understanding those boundaries have you had to remember right now and the process of understanding the boundaries and creating the edges of the world so to speak or the size of the planet and the size of the universe right just so I have a conceptual understanding of what that is before I'm the one to something and add something else to that anyway I have talked with you long I'll be it
