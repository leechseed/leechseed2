- Alright let's see 30 where are we just finished the 2nd last chapter of a story by Robert McKee that's interesting basically I've just been trying to figure out how I'm gonna break this down try the hardest part of this whole fucking thing but what I've gotten down so far so literally I'm gonna take things back to what we did before where we 1st highlight the most important stuff I think we'll take it to that And then after that we'll break it down to certain concepts I mean they're based on the heading probably just based on the heading and then breaking down under each heading which each of those highlighted terms means in terms of like what is it is it defining is that the process is an explanation from that and then once I broke in that down that far I'm gonna have to start connecting things right connecting those concepts Or or do do I that so break me down even further like am I connecting the concepts like theoretically or am I connecting them as a process I think I do it theoretically 1st like how does this connect to this connect to this connect to thing is I don't think I could do it as a Web 1st but I can do it linearly right and then somehow mesh those Kind of linear connections together somehow like I'll do chapter by chapter into a linear connection through idea through ideand then awesome how do it that way right and then I'll have some sort of a map sort of worked out and want to have this map showed it worked out I can then start thinking of it and tunnel as a process almost As a process it could be that I could create some sort of exercises based on this process is we're not to do a lot of testing or I'm going to character I see how character kind of breaks down into that but then he goes into character and dialog the last 2 chapters but the funny thing is that those last 2 chapters are actually the next few books settings released was very interesting becauhere only touch on those 2 things but they aren't that big of a deal compared to what story is right the story doesn't really allow the concept of story go into character and dialog but it isn't really the other way around It's almost as if they're because dialog doesn't have to be part of it character does necessarily part of it I feel like character is expressing that macro level from seeing the scene because the plus minus and the the dualities of the dimensions of character which are can also be based on the dualities of theme and the The plot and it's true that a lot of this is done through passes right it's I think that's the way I have to see it as through 23 lenses right through like a microscope I guess no oh yeah or a map Right you get to lay the land and then you go deep or deeper like you do we need to be able to go back-and-forth but I need to be able to lay are these but then character goes on through these different levels also like what is character at this level depth that's the way to do it from different levels of perspective from the wide to medium to close and I have an en choosing to focus right so like what is character and all these stuff the stuff at this level But then we go down to another level and that's character deeper how it's expressed so like it there's a but then there's time for the plot maybe if I do it like dimensions like space right the 1st dimension is onlin depth right so 1 the 1st to mentioned 2nd imagine 3rd dimension 3-D 40 like that shit's have like that to the 1st dimension is very It's online basically a story that's theme the 2nd dimension is that that when then I need to have the dimension where the character comes in and then what's a character comes in time comes in that's what a story made out of but you know a character with actions and reactions but all that exists within space so space encouragement it's at all just the fucking you know what the Shit dad I have to do it through practice like that's the only way to do it but anyway I think what I'm gonna do and I'm just gonna go into the next book man like I know I'm gonna need all this information anyway and then once I have all the information together I can then process at all because you're just sucked out to go back again and add new stuff and then add new stuff Right anyway that's it a lot of just bullshit
