- We did 85 finally found a be lying to work with I'm working my way through just adding this database we have to create to basic base data I guess like the smallest form of data which this thing is gonna store patterns and ideas etc Patterns and ideas right now I'm working on patterns and and the way it works is that each pattern falls under a design language attribute must and must also fall one of the terms 1 of the attributes for narrative No I kind of don't want to add any other models right now I can't even remove the whole world building module just Jesus Christ that things are fucking based on Jesus right so this is just that's just it right there language language language to to language to literature right Perhaps on I feel like users are a good way to sort of format data views right so let's say the data entry guy like what his there are some rolls reviews that are actually associated with them It's not earlier and read in the book there are someone associated with the dead itself in a way to be presented in that way what are the biggest things that really help me sort of conceptualize the idea of a database is that you are viewing the database as a user it is a simulation of that data it is not how the data is actually stored right so when you're constructing the database you're constructing the data That really like helps figure things out right separates it too pretty well ooh ooh ooh boo boo boo boo boo boo and so each pattern you and at the base level should have a media type at least 1 or 2 ochie boo boo boo boo boo BA ba BA ba a literature based Right I don't have from a this literature base there should be like a set number of texts that will be used as reference so like you have that whole idea of a yeah that's see here what Bloom would call a cannon I believe that's what did the camera be Ooh ooh ooh Poo poo Poo poo kumbo kumbogey boogie boogie boogie boogie yeah I can't and that's what we'd set it up as shit there's so much data departs it would be a good idea just to use trying use that thing an obsidian yes yes I just really don't want that I feel like When I use the date of the endless thing cashing it's it somewhere in the memory and it's just gonna slow it down I should this is why I try want to keep and this separate use I should try using the Oracle as a data modeler do you poop you poop you be you oh you'll be Yeah I think what I'll do with the relational aspect of it is that what I do these modulizations of each part of the state of base it's all connected through shoot shoot the the literature data design the litcox chocolate dialect cock slut you is going crazy man yeah that's the whole plan Oh and I also have an idea for ATT RPG to do could be kind of cool called I guess I'll call it I'm going to right now it's some vista punk or a vista I'm Mr. I am or something like that but it's 4 years in high school where the goal you are a degenerate kid and your whole goal is to leave that town one way or another that's the whole goal at the end of it Or you're called like a don't agent AD Gen. And whether you really really put your nose to the ground or just say fuck it a lot of the attributes of this story will be characteristic of those 4 years of the 90s and also of 911 all that shit anyways it's about it
