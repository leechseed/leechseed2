- # 13 chapters
	- ## short-stories with 13 vocabulary words. one per chapter.
	- ## learn to read, you fucking stupid fuck shit.
	- the word is central to the story.
	- of that chapter
	- and evolves into the megastructure of the narrative
	- there's a lot one could do with this *very* wicked model
	- using reading comprehension (vocabulary) as story.
	- like a learn better than a 6th grader reading comprehension
	- also a story
	- also would be great for me, the writer.
	- could be a short step towards infinite jest, but just enough to entertain and enlighten that little will power we all have that drives our cum guzzling quest for brown starfish explorers.

- Leech seed 34 I'm approaching the end of the reading comprehension book in terms of transferring the knowledge from a book to locksec and as I'm reading through this book there are points where it says that to understand and to build entibility is to 1st comprehend the book while also reading it at the same time and it's just fucking dilemma that I'm stuck with and what I understand or I can conceive what the goals of the authors are And writing this book and my own personal goals with this book and how do I apply that and then applying this knowledge as background knowledge to my other background knowledge to create yet yes anyways so I believe the goal the authors use with this book is to want teach me what reading teach what reading copy engine is a very basic but I feel like a very comprehensive model that is good enough in my opinion to start Number 2 it's 2nd goal is to teach how to teach reading comprehension and and it's written by a teacher for teachers to teach God damn that's just what the fuck is a very dense buck now my goals applying to apply to the goals of the author is one understand and have a comprehensive grasp on what reading comprehension is To to learn how to teach myself teach myself that and that's itself it's fucking wicked as fuck because it's um I'm literally doing 4 things at once the whole idea now is just to break it all down the models are there and it's just I feel like what I need to do it's go through like it's all starts with vocabulary from what I understand so I just need to take what I have from the Each chapter I guess and then break it down in terms of vocabulary and what side broke in a down into vocabulary are then can apply the models right and to sort of bridge connections with these vocabulary meanings and what's I build those connections I then can the determined straight comprehension of knowledge is to recreate a model that is comprehensive of the knowledge of the text So to be able to basically you know to have your own version of the text in which that you understand that you can apply it to other background knowledge as from my understanding is so I basically need to rewrite this book I just want I want to call it rewriting because we're writing it's just what but we're using my own words one way of demonstrating comprehension once I come prinday this book a all then really hit the real goal of all of this bullshit and that's how do I buy a reading comprehension to my writing Everything got out of your seal to make goal of course my I just need to set up for that right and what do I have a comprehensive understanding what we can copy into this and then I can refer to it and then what time is better understanding of all this stuff I can reference back to it but on top of that I feel like the more important goal before I apply it to writing is how do I use these models to create background information to prove that I comprehend certain all the books right so it's understanding what we're eating Harper engine is one for Michael Michaels understand what reading Harper Hampton is Too to be able to apply reading hoppy hunction and what I've learned to create a systematic method of applying this tendency of approving myself that I understand certain texts through the ring comprehension number 3 to be able to apply that to my own writing Jesus fucking Christ dude how can we get this funderstand what reading comprehension is To create a model to apply what I've learned with written from behind you to prove many comprehension of certain aspects of knowledge nor 3 of all these same message to my own writing and for God on top of that is too fucking create my own version of what reading comprehension is oh my God dude so much for one mind hahaha what's a fucking idiot anyway that's about it
