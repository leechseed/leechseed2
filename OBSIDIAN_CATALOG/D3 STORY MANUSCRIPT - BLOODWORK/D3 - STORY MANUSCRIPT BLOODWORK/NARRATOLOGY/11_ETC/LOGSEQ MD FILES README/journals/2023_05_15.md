- Maybe at least she's Sonny for me maybe I could learn from it in the way he uses media as a way to convey his message you you know it's it's patronizing at that point it's sort of a purer I like that I'd like I heard this on YouTube a purity culture right it's a idea that of commentary it's not trading in a way it's it's just really It's just a commentary channel from a scholar I just want to give it's it's more normal of a feeling right whatever when I watch my old shit when it when I watch Claire when I watch my wife's happy song Despite there not being any views or not being any sortyou know hyper capitalistic culture of success it was a fun and good video even the videos I made when it with a bunch of clips felt good for virtwelve virtuous and a few like that's the type of language that people can understand me Babe feel like one of my competition has a very close minded and structuralist perspective of writing and ithe conversation doesn't really move forward necessarily it's that he just had to present it in a way to where I'm pitching it And it almost has to be presented in a way that is refined for his taste and I need to be able the meat meet his palate but it's not a real shaft because you you come to a shelf and an idea and you'll be able to help you I mean in any way that's that I mean hes virtuous but I just feel like he doesn't have much to say it's not really of the meat CJ used to be like that when it comes to the idea I'm just like how do I do this right like is it hard work it's doing having to do the things I don't want do do I have to genuineflect to the hyper capitalist nature of everything I remember Remember when I was filmmaking that when I was at the prime of it I was really good at it collaboration and finding other people to work with it would just be so easy when not necessarily easy you even have the pick and choosers no money money involved it was because you had a chance to express yourself in a way perhaps that's what I need to do There is there is so much I need to learn dude I really do think 3-D animation is a future and I really think the extent of what literature can give me is it's A thing is I don't think I need to write a script word-for-word like I want I need to have not a Bible I hate the fucking word by like using it when it's not The Bible not a nana you know I show Bible or a show manualike almost like a codex but a I'm going back to the division Actually what the way they cultivated that world that was really cool actually I think what I can do is 1st layer out kind of the II have this narratively with the subtextual subtextable and inferred aspect of a narrative I feel like that could be Design aspects so let's say it's speedy animated art right you're just an idiot machine that's what you in the language we'll have to be a multi multi fascinated study in the language needs to be it's a design language it's attached code it sounds like a source to The source text the source Bo K yeah call the source book like even the way I think is a narrative right it's the drama of it it's crazy there's also different layers to this right And I think a lot of it has to it's all very I can't really model it right now and I really don't what know it is what I can do is I can use this thing called these nuts I mea crab cycle of creativity use that as map of knowledge Of curriculum of just one level and I'll have to mas with that 1 level then I'll go deeper right what I can do with this also as I can make it a cre activity thing to wear I could make AUI oincognito deeper and deeper that will sort of be the representation of projection knowledge understanding I think I'm on the right track Again that 1 model where creativity is sexual is not joke when was the last time a kid started made something anyway we'll see how it goes

- I'll lead sheets only through in the truck tail end of the big bench so there's a lady named Neri oxman who brings up this really interesting model and I really find very very interesting she's very much of a future techno optimist in the merging of technology and all that jazz but I feel like that's a lot of her media right now as far as her brand but what I really like about The model for the crab's creativity cycle is when it is put within ratio do done it up within ratio with the model of bajas and the idea of design and it really incorporates a really holistical and how do I put it very much of the humanities way of how creatimothy and the cross over in the inter I don't know if it's your hobby but the multi model Influence and revolutionary aspect of how one sort of category of but say art influences science influences engineering which influences design which influences art right to the whole interest and elaboration of the art minix life equals whatever and what II feel like the most what I really glean from it what's really important is that it is that whole idea that it's a holistic approach to learning and the idea of revolutionary sort of design thinking put a model to it and it what it does it's almost like AA curriculum to study in the sense that Let's say when a medium of I don't really think I need to branch away from literature but what I remind it's still put literature as like the sort of bowhouse right that's just like the model to learn right the art would be called Jesus well I feel like there really need to be a philosophy of love and sort of what would you call it purpose of study What would you call it sort of a proposal and the reason is to W and I don't know if I feel like literature we're just going to art wouldn't it one minute but here's a thing I feel like when it comes to literature now I feel like it's good to study it because it's basically the machine language of human language Wow now we have these higher level sort of speaking languages with that are a lot more efficient in their way of communication in terms efficient like a textural like it's not even a book right like or you could even say gosh block post this point it's not written for to be a zunderstood at being written for an algorithm and it's not necessarily for the best of the human consumption it's more for to be It's not very virtuous but shit man story rigstory write perhaps story should be the overall I just so trash story there's contextuality do it what's the story of beginning middle and end but then it's like what type of story then you almost It doesn't invite curiosity is what II have the wrong with the word story narrative is almosto nose up event guard very posh wave speaking it's again hyper when I came up with this word called up let's see here performative hypercapitalism it's in the sense that we are performing value It's a performance of value not necessarily true entrance value for the sake of attaining perceived value for real value right fake value for real value and where this becomes very equal and kind of can we really dig yourself a deep rabbit hole here is in the dark ages it's like when you're when you're perceived value if somebody creates value that is not intrinsically valuable but a Let's say a boy aboiler or plate a fucking imitation of what true value I'll you is and then you exchange and that it's sold for real value and when that person the customer who bought the intrinsic value believes it is real value and then all of a sudden their values are shifted of what their concept of what true value is as shifted because inherently And and I really think it tosses people a lot of this is so much of this especially on the Internet when it comes to online marketing and everything when it comes to knowledge it's telling you that this knowledge is important it's more sales and technology and what is the performative technique rather than true return and almost it feels like our entire economic online the entire basis of economic online the nature of knowledge Is valued behind a PA wall and there is no way to verify that knowledge if you in fact I've not known anything beforehand it's wicked and this sense you don't even know if it's real or not but you paid for it and you feel like it is in terms of knowledge not enough times in terms of what do you call it um but about brain thinking perception perception and that's one of the 4/4 10th of the model 3 of the But I don't know a little about crab's creativity cycle is that I'm really fucking good at perception and culture and I'm coming up with these things like I'm talking ideas and an shit what I lack a lot of confidence is finding a medium in which I can create utility for people like how do I explain that I would do it with a story of course right But I have to imitate what is wantedid 1st it almost I have to like it I am I was going to reference art of war in this in which I 1st have to become one of them and then start influencing it in a way however it becomes the the idea of what is real pittigreet right especially when it comes to authorship and literature but then again let made is that just cognitive bias I mean Shakespeare probably wrote in playboy a couple of times but apparently hes I mean you're probably the best of his work but it's not remembered but all of his goes back into the inherent value of virtue and king Lear dude what's the one thing I want to do mand play but what is it do you wanna make movies Where am I art it's this whole reflective way of thinking which is very I feel like disruptive and unproductive when it comes to creative thinking let's start a new one

- Leech seed 72 here or back on the idea for Elizabeth to get resupplied in about it on Tuesday Sunday God's unconclusive so I'm not waiting to do things a little bit differently today I figure I know what to do to get research right so why not trying to write again like I did the other day work on the process more I have 3 possibilities I have this one idea called deer park Which is about the action park in New Jersey really good exercise and then I have what is it called which is the short short series about the terror horror film in a house of streamers and thenan I have overlooked it out of course none other than that I think that's it I mean I could say I'm exactly 6 but that's just not really on the floor right now I can scroll back maybe I can have 5 I think the most important thing is what I was washed out for the character themechin Fuji Bali in the deer park I feel like I've really important that I flush it out and then I get that right that's a sort of the bare bones of it I can see a beginning middle and end just by using and looking at that right for each one of these lines of The owner the older boss handed the younger brother right and all of that the owners 2 minds are youth and adulthood in the sort of subtext of that I could probably actually totally break that down even more maybe into some sort of psychology for the older brother it's fantasy versus the reality and the 2 dynamic if younger brother there's belonging and being an outcast And all of that what the deer park up a corn sort of conceptualized into one as a location in the evil antagonist could be the opportunity plus/the risk of what it means to be in America right the owner's goal I guess could be to recapture his youth and to give the opportunity of cause he thinks she's all you're doing around them are fucking trash but he sees that when they go to this park they remember to be useful again they don't know what it's like to be a kid the danger of it The strangeness of it and he wants that for the kids what time does windows kids die and that's the biggest economy that has to deal with things says I don't know but isn't that part of it someone thing you can't say I feel like people realize that death is all around us probably everyone remembers Jimmy smudge and Smith who died at action park But no one remembers the Isabella twins who had killed by a drunk driver same day which is more tragic hes not the he can't do that so 1 of them you can fix and 1 of them you can't apparently and the 1 thing I did is I fix it so why is it still a issue why it's still a problem it's that it isn't just a great story right that's what we all want the order broh hes kind of in the fantasy and reality hes kind of in the position to wear his the rest of his life is set out for hes part of a premed program but things is gonna have to work hard And the thing is that work hard at metalli starts right after high school right after we graduate part of them want to live that fantasy again to be to still live the right way to it not the right way but the good way I have the good way but you wants to say he has no regrets I feel like I turned into something is ever what it the same thing with that premium program that girl that's the foil to him that girl who who shows him like this is what life is about this is what you know becoming a doctor picking up a butt cheese rocks and miserable Now he has a chance either safe if there was a chance to where either has to save his brother or the rest of the world you'd say fuck the world Jesus my brother and fuck this and fuck that I'm having to do this because my brother's gonna be out there and I need to help him younger bro say software junior in high school hes all about belonging basically going to the same throat as his brother but don't like his brother no one's brother didn't having to stop him not even his parents their wise is brother stopping him And the brother the younger brother just younger brother fashion bites at the draws point of his emotions where his friend died just because someone so died doesn't mean I will that's not the point that is the point you just can't see past it you need to get ove rest and so did I none of this is your fault if you don't let me go I will never forgive you weather is like in Sylvia turn on turn on turn on the Internet Derrick park New Jersey's wildest summer 2025 right so foils it's like Bob foyle's owner's foil is just every parent ever though the brother's foil is the girl in medical already the older bro the younger bro as well is the older brother how does the each character overcome that is a result For the older bro he he chooses not to be in Mexico or just chooses to tough his own way or but maybe there's some sort of forgiveness there just as the while the adult older man but I guess it's the great gre of responsibility right the owner there is no forgiveness only punishment while the older bro there is forgiveness by forgiveness and the sense of What's it forgiveness but respect so punishment respect is a journey of a man right punishment respect and forgiveness and I think the thing here is that that really signed up the whole medical thing really lines up with maybe this kid is a lifeguard there and he takes his life seriously and so that's a lot of what the foil and the evilness with the but yeah I happened it there right

	- ## L-Theanine
		- **Summary**
		- [L-Theanine](http://examine.com/supplements/Theanine/) is one of the main psychoactive compounds found in tea. L-theanine is extremely safe and has been shown to mitigate the negative aspects of caffeine, such as anxiety, increased blood pressure and diminished sleep quality, while possibly improving upon the positive aspects. L-theanine taken with caffeine is one of the most reliable and safe nootropic stacks for improving focus.
		- Standard Dose: 200mg L-the
	- ## Curcumin
		- **Summary**
		- [Curcumin](http://examine.com/supplements/curcumin/) is a bright yellow polyphenol derived from turmeric. Curcumin has a long history of medicinal use in China and India. Today, curcumin is being widely studied as a therapeutic agent for diseases ranging from cancer to alzheimer's disease. Some curcumin formulations seem to improve aspects of cognitive function in healthy older adults.[[208]]In animal studies curcumin seems to have an antidepressant effect, which may be caused by increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Curcumin possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and antioxidant properties, each of which could substantially mediate its positive effects in alzheimer's model animals as well as healthy older populations.
			- depressant effect, which may be caused by increased hippocampal neurogenesis.
		- **Possible interactions**
		- Curcumin may inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9, which could alter the safety and efficacy of other drugs.
		- Piperine may alter the safety and efficacy of other drugs by altering their metabolism.
		- **Side effects**
		- Gastrointestinal upset, chest tightness, swollen skin, yellow stool, rashes, headache
	- ## Rhodiola rosea
		- **Summary**
		- [Rhodiola rosea](https://examine.com/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/) is a plant with a long history of medicinal use in Europe and Asia. There's some evidence to suggest Rhodiola rosea, reduces mental fatigue, physical fatigue and symptoms of depression.[[30]]Rhodiola rosea reduces stress induced excretion of cortisol and may inhibit AChE and MAO.[[33]] Rhodiola rosea does not seem to improve cognitive function outside of reducing mental fatigue.[[228]] Users commonly report acute stimulant-like effects when trying rhodiola rosea for the first time. Those stimulant-like effects may diminish with long-term use.

	- ## L-Deprenyl
		- **Summary**
		- [L-deprenyl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selegiline) (Selegiline) is a potent MAO-B inhibitor with a long history of use as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. [[129]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6428148) As a MAO-B inhibitor L-deprenyl works to increase levels of dopamine and phenethylamine in the brain. In some animal studies L-deprenyl administration was associated with improved learning. [[130]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11642657) However, L-Deprenyl's performance enhancing effects seem to be much more equivocal in humans. At least one study suggests L-Deprenyl may actually *decrease* performance.[[201]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3927932) L-Deprenyl has affinity for MAO type B inhibition at lower doses, which means usual dietary restrictions on [tyramine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyramine) and its precursor tyrosine may not apply. At higher doses above 10 mg L-deprenyl may lose its selectivity and begin to inhibit MOA-A, at this point it would be prudent to follow standard MAO-I dietary restrictions. [[131]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8858937) Although therapeutic doses of L-deprenyl are unlikely to cause a hypertensive crisis, they can still increase blood pressure when co-administered with tyramine. [[132]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3929314) The primary metabolites of L-deprenyl are l-methamphetamine, l-amphetamine and N-desmethylselegiline, so L-deprenyl use could be problematic for people who get drug tested. These metabolites are physiologically active, but the l-isomers of these amphetamines are much less potent than their commonly abused d-isomers and they do not give L-deprenyl a strong abuse potential. [[133]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360227/)[[134]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17873134) L-Deprenyl use is generally not associated with significant side-effects or adverse reactions. Interestingly in some experiments L-deprenyl actually seemed to increase the life-span of some rodents.[[135]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3147347) In most countries L-deprenyl is a prescription only drug, but it's usually not highly scheduled.
		- Standard dose: 5mg L-Deprenyl
		- **Side effects**
		- Dry mouth, insomnia, euphoria, increased libido, increased blood pressure
		- **Warning**
		- Female oral contraceptive may drastically increase the bioavailability of L-Deprenyl. This increased bioavailability may make the standard dose dangerous. [[190]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2014223/)
	- ## Tyrosine
		- **Summary**
		- [Tyrosine](http://examine.com/supplements/L-Tyrosine/) is a non-essential amino acid and a precursor to dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. There is some evidence to suggest tyrosine supplementation can affect performance on working memory tasks under certain conditions, especially stress.[[51]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863934/)[[52]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17078981)[[53]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8293316)[[54]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11274672) Tyrosine may enhance convergent creative thinking.[[171]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25257259) In one study tyrosine seemed to even ameliorate some of the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance.[[86]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12887140) However, if tyrosine increases working memory performance by enhancing catacholamine levels the effect could easily be short-lived. Some animal studies have shown dopamine levels quickly return to baseline.[[55]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3214752)
		- Standard Dose: 2 grams on an empty stomach
		- **Warning**
		- Tyrosine is a precursor to tyramine and thus may be a significant risk for people using MAO inhibitors.
	- ## Creatine
		- **Summary**
		- [Creatine](http://examine.com/supplements/Creatine/) acts as an energy buffer in the brain. It is converted into high-energy [phosphocreatine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphocreatine) in the body, which helps to create [ATP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate). During times of activation the brain rapidly drains phosphocreatine to keep ATP levels constant.[[19]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1618937) Oral supplementation of creatine has been shown to increase brain creatine levels between 3.5-13.3% with the average being about 8%.[[20]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10484486) This additional buffer of energy may enhance performance on demanding tasks related to IQ.[[21]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19773644)[[88]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20570601) For healthy young well-rested omnivores, creatine does not seem to enhance function in other domains.[[22]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21118604)[[23]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18579168) For individuals who are sleep deprived creatine seems to consistently enhance [executive function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions).[[87]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17046034) Although vegetarians and vegans seem to respond best to creatine supplementation, vegetarians and omnivores have comparable baseline brain creatine levels.[[24]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691485/)[[25]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24290771) Creatine supplementation does not seem to affect levels of brain creatine or cognitive performance in children.[[226]](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2016-0406#.V_0yCe1Otps)
		- [Creatine Meta-analysis](http://www.gwern.net/Creatine)
		- Standard Dose: 5 grams once in the morning with plenty of water. To increase the saturation rate take 20 grams for the first week.
		- **Possible Interactions**
		- In patients with Parkinson's disease, creatine intake and high caffeine use (>300mg per day) was associated faster progression of the disease as measured by the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale. [[207]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366971)
		- **Side Effects**
		- Stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, water retention
		- **Questions**
		- **Do I need to take a special form of creatine?**
		- No. Creatine monohydrate is likely to be just as good as any other form and it's much less expensive.
	- ## Omega-3 (EPA & DHA)
		- **Summary**
		- Both [eicosapentaenoic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid) (EPA) and [docosahexaenoic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid) (DHA) may have roles to play in maintaining proper cognitive function. DHA is a major component in neuronal membranes accounting for a substantial fraction of the brain's total weight. EPA isn't abundant in the human brain, but it may have beneficial effects owing to it's anti-inflammatory actions. Both EPA and DHA have anti-inflammatory as well as vasodilatory effects. DHA is also a precursor to [NPD1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotectin), an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent. [[94]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22841917)
		- EPA and DHA could be cognitive enhancers, but the evidence for that hypothesis is not strong. There have been some positive results published,[[95]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16269019)[[96]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23515006) but there have also been many negative results. [[97]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22715808)[[98]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22250656)[[98]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21864417)[[100]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19356306) For all the hype surrounding the cognitive effects of EPA and DHA the results have been underwhelming to date. It's not at all clear that most healthy adults will cognitively benefit from supplementing EPA and DHA. Though there is some evidence that people who have a low dietary intake of DHA, may benefit from taking ~1200 mg of dha per day.[[267]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23515006)
		- EPA and DHA may however have synergistic effects with other compounds. There exists some evidence to suggest EPA & DHA paired with other important membrane precursors including choline and uridine monophosphate may increase synapse formation [[101]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16631143)[[102]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18631994)[[103]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17683870)[[104]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17950710) and could potentially mitigate early stages of alzheimer's disease. [[105]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20129316)
		- Note: There are three main forms of omega 3, alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is commonly found in plants and can be fairly effectively converted to EPA if you don't have a diet high in linoleic acid (most commonly found in processed foods containing cottonseed oil and sunflower seed oil). ALA does not convert well to DHA. Supplementation with DHA is most likely necessary for everyone if you don't obtain it from your diet. Vegans can source DHA from algae derived supplements.
