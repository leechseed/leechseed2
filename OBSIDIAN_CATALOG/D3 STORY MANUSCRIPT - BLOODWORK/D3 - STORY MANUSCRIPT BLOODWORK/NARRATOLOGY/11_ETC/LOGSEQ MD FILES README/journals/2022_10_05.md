- Leach seed 14 I just completed the labyrinth of blooms universal themes be i found Actually is that plot 2 theme are plot to labyrinth is the fact that plot is someone who can be represented that's that's it as an imagery in imagery as a labyrinth and itself and the difference between glamor and amaze all that meant is deliberately constructed with one entrance in 1 exit while amazed can I multiple entrances and multiple exits and labyrinth has a center where the something of knowledge or something great exists and then the exit is fairly flat swell and camels you know journey of a hero while a good site 1 to 1 pretty much But what makes it a little more interesting is that it allows the writer to sort of Grasp the idea of what plot kind of is it isn't just A-line that goes up-and-down it's a detailed labyrinth right it's it's there there choices that 1 has to make if they stay on the right path then they will hopefully succeed but if they make the wrong decisions they may go down the wrong path down the wrong path making the wrong decisions and die and that's what makes it so interesting is it's popcorn does it performed as a path of choices and the designer of wages lthe designer which is of like a God or whatever or the creator or the writer in the sense that they are stuck in their own labyrinth But the idea is that it's designed building on top of that without design it's the idea that it's not that it's a job of the writer for the person for the reader to get lost in that labyrinth to be engaged fully in that labyrinth to every choice of that character character's make Printing narrative tools near literature literary devices right and so when I'm going back through these and taking sort of clarifying what exactly I've been taking notes on making the notes I need to think about how the theme impacts each one of these literary devices and which 1 it does like primarily what labyrinth does is it influences plot a lot right I can't see that it's very present present very God how do I put it in this fucking butt butt butt butt It just presents itself very clearly and using it as imagery dream it's almost too much though right unless you're really going for it as really having that be the central plot I don't plot imagery everything on the plot like I've also seen it being used in a narrative style as well right I was well right I and just so wanted to take this along with other the other themes that I'm doing to understand how these variations kind of not only are I can turn these into Controlling ideas but also technology teammatic variations very on narrative fucking fucking literary devices right and I think this is how you can have a multiplicative or a manifold that's a better word of themes that intersect within a novel or a story you know you could have the controlling theme much I think it's always good to have a controlling theme like dinner or lunch or breakfast right it's always cause you gotta have to give people something to work with but underneath that you could have You know flavors and tones in different ways of each and every component that delivers all the way through your tasting menu right which is really fucking interesting along with character and why not I'm also been thinking on the idea of an a large cast family members and such like how do this theme apply to the not so like that's a flat character like the parents of a controlling play controlling theme theme character if anything they would provide Evidence as do I that part like I feel like there are main controlling purpose would be to provide evidence as to why the controlling theme of that the more prevalent character the rounded character is that way right I feel like God there's certain things that certain authors say it's just like a novel was like an encyclopedia or a novel is like something something like like that on top of that this guy I forgot whatt datalist or whatever says Zeta believes that humanity is manatee is goes in cycles of millenniums like 2000 years just kind of an arbitrary number to kind of think about it He says that Christ the beginning of one millennium like the the birth of Christ and the turning of the new millennium which I would say is 911 which is in my interpretation could be that as America as Christ of this generation and perhaps how everyone models like themselves as America right America as Christ I think that's pretty much really cool to think about top of that he believes that twin gyros are like Yin and Yang is probably a much more easier way to think about is that there's 2 controlling polar opposites in which during the millennium it's which is back-and-forth I'm going back to the gyros are gonna hook together and they're kind of twisted and and through time they twist what's really cool about that is that when you throw time as it passes through time and almost creates like a staircase a good winding staircase or you know you can even say DNA what's interesting images you can use that to reinforce a lot of what you have to say what you have to say that was feeling pretty shitty last couple of days for like I was not getting anywhere but you know clearly I've done a lot I really need to continue to do in these audio reviews or research reports cause they definitely help me out right next have to do I think it's sin and redemption 4 more to go I think only 4 more to go until I move on to the next thing I don't want to push too hard but then again I do want to push myself still but I don't want to fucking like what do you call it bench too much do I don't like actually get anything out of it anyway that's it
