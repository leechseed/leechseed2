	- We need seed research log number 7 so what I've done is I've actually taken 2A blooms universal themes today and I've done them the American dream and evidently evidently no up until the American dream and name and holy shit Sylvia disobedience what strange is that I've noticed how a lot of these themes but only did they cross and Literary works like people people take apart the same literary Canon literary cannon but they interpret them separately separately to embody these themes and I'm doing interesting to think about the process in which one creates creates with having such an infinite potential of interpretation the idea what theme is and antopos like what is a controlling Thing about this or is it but I guess a Bloom States that theme theme isn't perpetual a per you're a terrperiod or. Um I'm just gonna call authority appear isn't infinite infinite conflict with itself or appeor superiority or priority in in reference to In the interior interiority party and perpetual interiority and conflict and perpetual perpetual conflict an interiority so what hes trying to say here is that when you are my interpretation is that when you are writing or creating that the theme is merely just a one of the many Several literary devices which it's used to create narrative and as a writer you are always inconstant Struggle but as you're creating your turn to prioritize as your creating throat which their device is important at what point in time time and away it's like a sport guess what all these skills come together and just alt but that certain point in time you have to prioritize one over the other to get to the logical conclusion or whatever you want to be it want to be the end to be which is somewhat of a relief understanding that understanding that a lot of these individual skill sets that you learn Are not necessarily practice in a certain order or in a certain priorization but used used by the author in their own stylistic manner I think that's what creativity and art and where the balance of knowledge and creativity come together cause you can know a lot you can analyze a lot lot or you can have Passion and I need to say something but unless you're able to understand what but do you understand what both sides are trying to do Another process you should not walk shut up lock not pushing the envelope in a way it justifies a constant thirst for knowledge and to push oneself to understand more and more and more what I like about the American dream several books or several pieces of literature that Bloom analyzes is at it when it comes to theme their permutations To tobos let's say the American dreams that tobos each one of these books go to chair and yard the works are analyzed by literary scholars and they themselves create a controlling idea or thing idea or a controlling theme interpretation of thinterpretation of the talbos and and it's infinitely just interpretable ways to be interpreted however it is only the author That creates the work so how does one create the work there's 1 embody the mindset of literary criticism or is it a completely different method personal personally I feel like it's the the difference between a professional athlete athlete and a professional Sports commentator I feel like a true professional athlete or a coach that in the coach right oh my shit in a way the athlete especially on the team while I guess an individual sports like tennis And must understand send interiology auto sport this would be the most function as a coach and all the players and all the skills at 1 time just thought I think that's what's writing i.e. Being professional athlete consist of is it really confidence in the knowledge and the creativity to harness is like the moments of Gustavo And to understand and to have confidence in one's ability to harness that and to create that dad well I've been talking for a while it's really fascinating the more I doubt into theme part of me needs to feel like I need to go out for some air I need to I mean I mean take my head out of theme for a bit And kind of get my bearings and maybe go back to save the cat and I think I just need to what would I it call it a picture run picture run or just a glass over film's version of save the cat simply because I'm only choosing some of the cats ate the cat because it is what triggered me to go on this journey in the 1st place of course there are other narrative Vegans like McKee and nipple are I say their names all the time bit's all the time but I don't know what about it with save the cat it's that it's um blur is very you know step-by-step and let it go left right like one of the brains it's brains it's binary whom hes gonna call binary what story is also binary save the cat is holy so unprofessional or unprofessional an or academic that it's Allows a lot of room for interpretation which I never knew was value until I did it so that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say the cat movie version see what it has to say after that maybe jerk off or something tomorrow I do want to do 2 more and maybe able to do it in a row one right after the other bloomstein I don't know really what I wanted to do I can There are 2 ways I can go about this I couldn't really analyze analyze and relate break down each one of these interpretations of the theme really understand what they're trying to say but if I do that I'm really going be going back I don't know each other when he says it when the there needs to be someone begging with ambiguity with it right if I start defying these things then those creativity it is but I feel like I just need understanding what it is a car is a car I need to know how it works but I know what it is priorization After what am I gonna do after blue or I think that's what I'm gonna try and do after save the cat with save the cat trying to find a oh that's right I'm wanna put forth the possibility of using the idea of but for but for the the possibility the idea of I'd like to come my brain Tends to always come up with premises very easily very good premises and what if I take my knowledge with theme and apply the premise of the theme once I do that I can perhaps build characters or understand a policy applaud understand I for me might be the next step premise and theme maybe I'll come with that understanding and seeing what people think about premise and then character

	- OK so does the leech seed number 6 research log research log yesterday I the recorded started started to break down the boom's weathe boom's literary literary themes 1st one the only 1 I did was alienation and with alienation what's interesting about the structure I was booked is as at he 1st says it's a small time They can be used and at least 15 different stories and well that's called an interesting meet after read the whole fucking book What's interesting But I'm I guess the biggest thing I came out of what this what I learned from reading it is that theme can be expressed alienation can be expressed in an animal attitude of methods of ways alienation through blackness alienation through isolation alienation through kingliness it's just a solid theme of alienation can be broken down there's so many different ways it really drills down the idea in the concept that every single word in every single page in a film should I purpose Because if it's not because of its moving forward the film was moving forward the film is moving forward it can also be dramatically moving forward if there needs to be a transition it could be thematically transitioned right so every suit oh every so constant engagement purpose in every single 2nd of the film is what I think so I wrote down his sort of 15 interpretations about the embar and what I can use is have will I could have alienation be the topos and then I can have the theme my own theme And that my own controlling idea I can then express all of that through these 15 different types and methods I was laid backup by in other films such but are not films of lithey're not feeling the literary stuff and what's interesting is that he applies a theme to almost everything other another from teenage isolation to to teenage elimination throage in the nation through illumination in a jail cell right From biological isolation to alienation to sexual alienation in Asian that this theme can be really applied to anything especially in character each 1A character can embody each one of theseach 1 of these 1 of alienations permutations I guess the idea of dualism of a dual alienation of how alienation can exist in the same space but in 2 different methods 2 different ways I've ever expressed that before And in the the writing I guess another I feel like this is a proper way of doing it you know I'm going to have to go through each one of these things 1 at a time to really understand them I understand them and I feel like once I go and take the time of understanding each of these core and 15 themes delete these things are known as universal these topo's are topi or no 1 is universal and once I grab these I really think There are issues I've run into when it comes to writing and which I have writer's block when I'm "and I have nowhere to go buthere to go but or how do I get from here to there anthematically I think is the answer and I think this also applies to TV as well as normal film when it comes to film it almost seems like I'm translating really just trying to do that on the core theme while with television I feel like it's a lot more exploring this name like with the film is much more of it Of a thesis statement wild wild TV is more like a phD or not like a app dissertation dissertation I think it's kind of controversial to say but in a display controversial but you only have 90 minutes some people are really good at writing theses and some people make a living off and that's fine my opinion that's that's what it can be of course there's series but then it becomes when it comes into a series then becomes a dissertation because an Explorer to a of that theme We're on another part of one so that's not what I'm gonna think about doing next I'm just gonna keep going down the list I think the next 1 is the American dream and and then after that I'll just keep going I'm gonna try and talk knock out too today
