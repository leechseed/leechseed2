	- OK let's do this we'd see lock 4 I did all the activities yesterday but but that was really tired and they're very kind of a bad mood after all happened there's a lot of the possibilities and i don't have to explore I've gotta forgotten forgot me down but it's a new day just talk to my brother at a good time reviewing the research whatever done with the voice notes desive describe try running it through grammarly grammarly but it pretty much says that it's all perfect don't know how that works but i was able to read through what i Actually said lock 3 I'm gonna got the point I was more glancing at it and understanding the key points of points of it I think in the future what I could do was just probably find the really important point to just build it out I probably would be the best way to deal with it after after that what iwhat I did worldwide was I was able to take the model myth turn every hero row 2 versions of it the original Joseph Campbell I think and another version from think 1998 ever gotta The 1 for 1998 actually goes into more finer detail and action detail and to actually what almost each of the of the steps in the core H step model myth and how each one can be kind of different permutations of let's say a call to action with that kind of action could be or different steps in it that it almost makes break it down into further steps adds there's sometimes right in the other 17 steps in the original 1 and it almost adds more fine coat tooth comb into describing what each 1 of those steps could be what they are he also provides several types of myths in general To support that and they're all from around the world not just Western mythology which is Rick and awesome I really enjoyed that enjoyed that that it's more of a worldly aspect to it cause I was one of the criticisms of Joseph Campbell's monument is that it's a very Western focused very Sis fucking white male center aint got to hit that shit I want to do was I do want to add the feminine the hero the journey of heroin into it because primarily with the fall or fall there's starting 2 females so I wanna see how that implies that I've also created a new page in log sec which Talks about the modern myth right I'm thinking I'm gonna add anything that has to deal with it and I think with the monuments it's under as plot in terms of narrative storytelling I almost got stuck in the research hole of what narrative design is but of course I wrote a whole book on that and I didn't put that under the umbrella and I believe narrative design goes under I think I think the plot goes under narrow design and the the drink of heroes a plot structure that's what I want to put it under it cause to have narrative design being overarguing or a whole another thing can just muddy things up because what what it is it's blocked structure But the caviot with that is that there's a whole like a 100 different types of blocked structure right and this is just talking about movies I'm going to keep focusing on movies and we're try that snowflake method I think I'll give a shot with that at um after that on Adele rental car Alexandra and story and actually I can make a call and for charges right plus minus plus minus plus mi'm supposed to mind I suppose mine is I'd like to help out a lot actually And just measure that up emotionally right because like that goes on with everything right the positive and negative is represented the binary of drama is present in almost every form of narrow design design I think I only should do it for the beats or because the beats and the thematic controlling idea are what controls everything else like that the characters and everything so that could be my reason for doing that Also I've downloaded all the books for Caroline booms thematics like all his general themes general themes really really world worldly themes of just very general stuff nothing like a controlling idea that Mickey talks about the controlling idea I think there's a finite more new watched form of the theme I mean it doesn't dismiss the theme at all and the theme is important the controlling idea is a it's a cause the theme is universal there's a lot packed into a theme And what the theme is is what the controlling idea is AAA suppyes it is AA subject at the theme of what you want to focus on with a fun within theme right that I know the issue I was having with thematic creating themes in the 1st place is just the idea that I have to be fine detailed or also being macro the same time the idea is that you're not both but the theme is complex so your solution must be complex right your presentation and your pitch doesn't have to be and that's the difference is when you're actually constructing something and building something and then showing somebody what you're building right it's just when you're transmitting translating towards anyone else you still have to translate Where there's always translation involved it doesn't matter who it is if it's somebody else my brother is an agent a director anyone it must be translated towards what they need and what they want what they are looking for what you provide what you provide is is everything else that they're not thinking about get about the fine detail the questions that they have later right but the Britain's initial presentation must be tailored to them that's interesting so yeah the one what I want to do is at some point I do want to break I want to break down each 1 of my audio recordings the text end down to just what's important After that I don't know when I'm going to do that but after that I wanna do want to explore each of the thematic things of Bloom and then I also want to add the heroine's story err journey tor of don't heroine ever hear the one to the plot analysis and what all that's gonna lead up to is up to is what's once in the middle of the plot analysis I think I want to do it with something else with another film that's a thriller why doing that I am trying to find proof that it's somewhat universal at least in thrillers At this point points are and once I prove that when I'm able to do cause I'm able to take these plot points and pride them to applaud Alexandra's versions of accents sequences sequences kind of justify the structure of the plot of the plot of journey of hero against changing the structure of Alexandra's idea of what of what statue it is that's the idea that's the intent and what's I have that then I can focus less on act and struck and act and sequences and more on following these plot signals rather than the format in the form of acting structure act and sequences I think that's what I'm trying to get at
