  id:: 644d143f-25ee-43cb-a29b-1c5213e22864
	- I switched over to CM Storm Xornet Claw Grip
	- Using the Ergonomic Design as reference I began to understand the principles of mouse grip that I never understood before.
	- According to the design, using my thumb, forefinger, and pinky, GRIP the mouse and use that to make smooth movements.
	- I feel myself gaining 'control' of the mouse rather than kind of reacting to my wild flicking finger tip no grip reactionary type of aiming.
	- I'll call it the **Playboy Grip** because the activated muscles in the hand are exactly the same as making a bunny using shadow puppets back in the day
	- I believe this *tiny fucking change* will help me immensely in every game
	- I also **changed my windows mouse sensitivity settings** *to 5*
	- The standard DPI polling rate built within the mouse is 1000 DPI
	- I don't really understand the nature of going higher or lower so I'll keep it there
	- **Consistent pressure throughout the mouse movement will keep aim consistent and controlled**
	- **Grip the Mouse with the Thumb and pinky**
		- These two fingers should grip the mouse, at the base of either side.
		- The sides of the thumb and pinky should consistently be touching the mousepad as well as gripping the mouse.
		- Remember to **activate these muscles** for proper form
		- The thumb and and the pinky act as control and command processes.
		- In excessive jerky movements, the acceleration and twitch fibers should be fast, but also smooth.
		- The thumb and pinky effectively glue the mouse to the mousepad acting as traction and preventing the mouse from uncontrollable and inconsistent aiming
		- With practice, the mind will be able to engrain these routine movements minimizing the need for on the fly micro corrections

- # Improving Mouse Aim in Gaming
	- [Ron Rambo Kim FPS Aiming](https://www.fpscoach.com/aimingformula)
	- Instead of paying $100 for this course I will attempt to use the syllabus as a guide to find tutorial content on youtube and reddit.
	- I will collect, analyze, and determine the quality of each module.
	- From there I will craft the adjusted free syllabus
	- Using the principles learned in learning development research I will then apply Bloom's Revised Taxonomy to the learning process
	- Throughout the process I will also monitor and asses improvement through batteries taken as I go through the course pipeline.
	- This is a wicked yet *fun* project to do when I'm between doing research bullshit
