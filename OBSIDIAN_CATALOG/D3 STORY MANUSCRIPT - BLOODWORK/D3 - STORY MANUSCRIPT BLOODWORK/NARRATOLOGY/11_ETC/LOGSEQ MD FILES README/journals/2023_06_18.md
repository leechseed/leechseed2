	- We'd see it 83 moving forward from the patternization temporary solution we're going to just use I'm city and yamo for mutter as a temporary solution but the thing is I think I just don't want to skip that shit create a mongo D create some sort of data entry fun data using I'm gooey Until the slightly light essay very light work I guess the whole idea is that it's very easy to use and I'm not texting very many system resources at least I mean the big idea right now I'm just gonna get a an example running and what's get I that running I then find a way for to talk to Longer DB and I really believe I have a basic idea of what exactly I'm made a data will be within the client itself I feel like there's a lot of God there's gonna be a lot of let's see here I'm confer seen quality of life moments I think I would use Google's I think I can distinguish from a design perspective just designing the UI once I get the UI set up I just get the front end set up and get the back and set up and have them talk and then prove that they can talk to each other after thati'll model mongoon like ADI went on a data set would look like a monger TV Like II have to move forward because I can't just stop and really super analyze everything get the perfect solution something that I've realized Li can just document all my I'm going to the books and read research this again but it's just not moving forward right and I think that's where I can of had a pretty fall once I what's I got a good bearing of what exactly I was doing by reading those books last year and really getting a good stable plot form of story and narrative storytelling under my belt now as I can I can actually implement that and use it I don't need to go through the same exact thoroughfare I did with with a narrative design because this is more of a means to an end rather than designing a tool for it like designing the perfect tool and updating it not just needs to work at that point I want I can just hire a software architect and just have to rebuild it and have them you know as a service I'll keep it but for now I'm just kind of having a proof of work Minimize a product of database injury from on the TV and then I think I need to go to I think the thing I did would be here to like if I do I create separate nodes and modules like a screens are like what is it called work spaces for each one of these micro processes these are systems within The writing framework or do I create separate EX e's like I feel like it's a so light weight it should be able to just run in the one compiled program and it's made for iteration you know I could fix it but up and I think the way I couldn't where I can do this is how I'll design it modularly right I'll all work on modules at time and then I'll be I'll have them find a way to talk each one of them to talk to each other after that you know 1 thing at a time I need to be able to create a 100 increases at least very fast very fluently along with using log sack hopefully just completely avoiding having to drop in obsidian at all this 1 time I realized it's just like I can use obsidian for you know as a sort of middle wear 2 mongo But it's just blow and things that I can get caught up in another ecosystem where I have to use it but that's so fucked up without obsidian is that it's its own entire ecosystem yet the to play biatch rules use its extensions you know well if I can use these open source depository is I'll be able to 11 Dover free to no contribute to the community 3 I've a lot of support that isn't behind some asshole on YouTube 2000 of course that comes with its own practicals but such as a nature is offer development right and you know I have basically have the working idea of what these components are like why model them and then do the program why not just make the program 1st the model as long as I understand me I understand that the modeling leaders more for just to communicate to others Right cause I'm figuring this out on my way like if I model everything beforehand and it doesn't work in the program like I think I could do all of that kind of an imagination of one point right but I know that's my life
