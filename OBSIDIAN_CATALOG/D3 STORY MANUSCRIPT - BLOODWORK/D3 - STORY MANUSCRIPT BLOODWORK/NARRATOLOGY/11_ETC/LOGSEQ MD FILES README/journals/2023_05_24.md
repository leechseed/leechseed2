- Alright let's eat 79 here for another update can we talk about C and really doubling and deep with the established fusion AI subject it's relatively easy as much as I thought it would be I think I'd I have a background and python and creating my own coding department on my own coding environment but I'm unprompt The python and church it BT is basically helpful right everything I need to so I found a good model that I think is good for at least Oscar really replicates her very well and the stylistic manner I still need to find a way to oh actually no I'm just gonna it's not really about style right now at least to visual style going about that letters when I'm listening to them by approximately So that's probably the biggest minimum viable product I've been restarted yeah see here I think that biggest issue right now is to figure out how some of the other tools work like being able to compete to use competition competition depth and really being able to frame shots And uprising probably 4 days a lot you going know 24 we're frames we're going 24 frames and we're ending onchoose that's sad see you 12 friends the 2nd Dude I mean that's a lot of frames to render they're papa I don't 4K think is necessary 2KI don't forget about 2KI think Tuesday is a good rendering density I can also I need to also update update and merge at least well I just let them do that I think 2.5 is fine or 1.5 is fine I don't wanna mess around too much sir I did get some books on scripting language I'll build the outline pretty well I can probably do that next just to get a good outline done of the film of these short film and I got the music to do was well delete that the 8 hours actually I'll be able to download books again Probably do something on music music theory music production and mixing and all that jazz I'd like to fucking do man but I've gotten a lot done already I think the whole balance of this what I'm trying to do here is get a clear enough picture to wear me with delight just rub away enough dirt to be like to be able to see it and say I can figure the rest out later I can see the path and how it's gonna work Just basically proving yes it's going to wlike 85 90 95% sure it's gonna work without actually doing it because then I told you like that 95% is only like 10% of the whole fucking thing but it's crucial because you need to figure out the rest voices all what's great about this doing it doing a sort of cover like this from mass effect is that I already inherently have the character traits Of each character in my head cause I played the game you know the theme is to save the world whatever it takes or the Galaxy whatever it takes and just like whatever that takes is that mean can you still save the Galaxy as a good person can you see a still save the Galaxy or you have to be the villain this bag is as bad as the villain you know king there's a lot of small things and battles about race and sort of contemporary themes about power verses Politics versus getting things damerican themes just I feel like if you're there your dream is American there's gonna be a lot of American subtexts if you like a lot of people don't understand until they see a movie that doesn't made in America you know that the Korean movie like parasite that that I think the whole idea is to go for that and I really like that ultra real look you know I think the most iconic thing about all the faces is the mechanic thing about Holiday is their faces right the touch of smiles and the a anger in the like mouse animation and emotion and I feel like what I have to do with you know I haven't had any book I got a reference to that a copy fad said like emotions know they have those in pinterest those mood boards there was a side-by-side And and different the emotions of yeah and I guess what I did I could really just why could you save well I'd want to save plan to shepherd as a officer and outlater it's gonna be done it's just gonna take a lot of detail Alright

- Leap seed 78 moving towards there's a lot more research with the stay with the fusion AII really I wanna go a state refusion because the majority is like that you have a comparison to it it's like that using the Instagram filters where your phone to take pictures I'm a professional say what a fusion is more like a tool and honestly it's pretty simple there's not even a lot of coding a lot of it is just from what I can tell Downloading and install Earth I guess I'm going installing certain models combining those models to make a new one I think the biggest issue though actually is space I think what I can do is it's now the time that I something like put in my network together and putting all my other stuff towards the other PC would be a good idea I mean honestly if anything I feel like just taking that hard drive and pushing it over it is just enough and leaving the rest open I really do think I'll need a eat another hard drive I'm thinking I'll be that 1 that's too expensive I figured out how to have a terabyte Somewhere sitting around I could make roum block Jason's auto bunch of stuff for the music music no we can make it work to the doctor docto the da da da da da that I mean here's the thing that I'm not spending money on mid journey which is personally for me feels good because to know that same refusion is actually a more powerful program no more Usable program and where I get to define my own perimeters and such you're crazy is that I all these pictures I've been taken to put on my TVI can use those in the models and creating certain models which is which great is this is creates such an opportunity know where it's possible to do Every step to make something every single fucking step from the sound to the to just the visualizations for the testing you can leave me crazy certain buildings and have them betrayed it and prompted perfectly and you could have certain models to use and then you can upload them oh you know what I have that google thing I have Google Drive I have 2 drawer I have fucking 2TB on it I guess the question isn't I don't want to store locally or not we'll see I think I'll restore locally and I'll just upload all that other stuff look at that I'm actually a lot more happier now come to think about it when am I doing all this literature research oh what I did find this program called private AI which can take text files and just answer questions apparently I don't know how good this shit is but if it is holy shit that's a little wild I think what the biggest thing after ball in siyaga is or Bangladesh yaga is too refine the process and after refining the process then find some way to inject it in the traditional 3-D animation cri think for the dancing what I can actually do Is 1st do the movies myself after I create the song I think I also go on TikTok to reference a lot of already generated shit of dances that people have and it's definitely possible because you have the you have those anime ai actuations And I just think using the like the sort of nesting nature of AI like and I just have perhaps even a word or a token for each move and from each move and in between maybe 2 like what as how would you say it how would I be animating there's like 2 threes or 4 it's right there's like 2 Zen forests and then I would just need to keep a database of 2 lack of slaughter data in the store of each move And then considering what's I do every you at the name each one and then do the in bethat's sort of the biggest fanthat in the fights but I think I can do the fights easily to do it probably be to do an image to image and create it that way And the thing is I just don't think a lot of people just want to put in the work to create some really good stuff that's I think that's just the issue cause oh my God dude this shit is bananas man it's a lot of work but when you look at it the light at the end of the tunnel it's there and on the other side is art it's about it
- # SD Model -> Sampling method
- studied which model to sampling method generally works well together using the auska prompt
-
---
- ## The Auska prompt
	- The Auska prompt is a standardized prompt created by some weeb to test the functionality of turning SD into their own copy of NovelAI
	- However, I will repurpose for my own devices.
	- To simply serve as a boilerplate copy pasta for testing prompts.
-
---
	- -  Prompt
		- `masterpiece, best quality, masterpiece, asuka langley sitting cross legged on a chair`
	- Negative prompt
		- `lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts,signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name`
	- Sampling Steps = `28`
	- Sampling Method = `Euler`
	- CFG Scale = `12`
