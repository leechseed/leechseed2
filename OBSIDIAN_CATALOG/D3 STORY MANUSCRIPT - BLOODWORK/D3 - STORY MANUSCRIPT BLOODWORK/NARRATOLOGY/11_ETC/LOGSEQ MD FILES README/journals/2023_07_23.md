		- the kiku sets the scene, introducing facts or events.
		- the shōku builds on these facts or events, highlighting a specific element.
		- the tenku highlights a seemingly unrelated element.
		- the kekku, finally, makes the link between the two highlighted elements.
	- Here is a Japanese folk song that perfectly illustrates this original usage:
		- 大阪 本町 糸屋 の 娘 – Ōsaka Honmachi itoya no musume
		- **The daughters of the yarn seller in Honmachi, near Ōsaka**
		- 姉 は 十六 妹 が 十四 – ane wa jū roku, imoto wa jū shi
		- **The oldest is 16, the youngest only 14**
		- 諸国 大名 は 弓矢 で 殺す – shokoku daimyo wa yumiya de korosu
		- **The feudal lords of various regions kill with bows and arrows**
		- 糸屋 の 娘 は 目 で 殺す – itoya no musume wa me de korosu
		- **The daughters of the yarn seller kill with their eyes**
