- Alright let's see you at 60 finish the 1st chapter of the beginnings and what you've done so far is really locked down a preparation method of getting the data from PDF all the way to a format thatbasically breaks down into a summkey language and key sources right from there I think we need to simplify even more Using Hennessy's method of modeling and summarization I feel like what I can do as I can then translate everything down to us say you know bullets very magnetic sentences but smarter than sentences clauses and concepts and from those I can turn it into models from there from those models I then can create a process and then use that process to analyze other forms of art right and that's where I can sort of this is all why I think it's leading up to it's this idea of being able to I'm really kind of hooked on this idea of entertainment to allergy but now it's much more than intertextuality it's hyper and texture enter hypermedia type shit where the beginnings are so I don't think people consume different types of media now it isn't just books I didn't just say it's not in this and I think it needs to be considered what exactly are people consuming now and those successful points of those that type of media as well as understanding what I'm trying to do and I think what this is all also do is kind of proof and validate a lot of the concepts presented in This guy has and this sort of primary literature I still do believe that literature is the prime form of art media that's narrative. Just like with print narrative as consideratiand I really think it's gonna work right download to a book all the way to TikTok or I don't want to break down tweet because tweeters fucking useless I think that's what's really cool about it and I think overall what's going to manifest out of this Is a study as well as analysis or method or AI think like a it's gonna be called a the you gotta do a beginning's analysis right it's how you understand how things begin certain things and that's just one way to at tack a story let's say if I have an idea that's 1 way I can figure out if they come up with 1 and if it isn't done in this I can actually retool it to also do almost be like endings Although I feel like I'll do that in the future at some some point I'm sure there's a body of book about it somewhere I just have to find it and I'm sure I'll try to be in this book somewhere but yeah it's me a lot of Burke's homework can offer me but that's this is like great progress magnificent even fantastic I said to keep on going moving forward I'll see here I am not so sure how beginnings and intertextuality were kind of mashed in to just this one thing when I thought it would could just be about beginnings cause I feel like intertexturality can be OK I don't know how I get it because yet the event protects you others that there are no beginnings but there has to be them they speak as a chicken before the eggs have to thing you're a text or a shit books that I do not or not intertect intertectual or outbooks You know we are not influence we are all we don't live in vacuum it will be an incredible perspective not to think about it is if I write that character likes it sooner or her entire existence is in a vacuum in space and all she knows about the world is through media and hertwitter I feel like a grand irony Of this character is one person that she hates almos the only thing that is allowing her to connect with the people of Earth when she gets down there this is the only relationship you've ever had that was reand so sure her entire that's arc heroic arc That's an interesting thing to analyzeplots and arcs well like the journey of a hero can you one it can also be a continuation like after that journey every hero can be the journey of mythological journeys a big poem is write Dante all I jazz to sort of constrain oneself to journey of a hero and then having to make a journey of a hero for the plot issues for the 2nd 1 it's just white what are you doing no it's just there's other Elements right yeah the poem the question is more that's all I've been doing right now huckleberry dirt journeyed on the river of the road oh really I really am proud of myself for last month or so because I feel like I've made more progress than I have in a very long time actually moving no wait that's it
