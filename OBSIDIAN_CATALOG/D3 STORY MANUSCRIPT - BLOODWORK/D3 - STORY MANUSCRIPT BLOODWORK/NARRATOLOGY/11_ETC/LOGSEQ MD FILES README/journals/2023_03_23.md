					- It must be the scene that immediately provides return of the viewers investment of time.
					- Not only must the viewer feel compensated for their investment, but the profits must vastly outweigh the initial risk so they will continuously reinvest and trust the story.
					- There's nothing like a good set-up to rock a bitch's socks off.

- # First Steps of Narrative Creation
	- Use what you have as an idea, and start identifying relations with narrative devices
	- Identify as many thematic dualities as possible
	- Develop depth and breadth in dualities
	- Use Specific Tools and Combine with Dualities
		- Keep in mind these are just for reference and are at all times capable of branching and creating depth.
			- Human Behavior Higherarchy
				- Self/Self Regard
				- Familial Relationships
				- Society
		- Once a duality is created, create a ^^*contextual thematic container*^^
		- Within the contextual thematic container are two equal and opposite states known as ^^*honne*^^ and ^^*tatemae*^^ or the ^^*honne-tatemae divide*^^
		- *honne*- in its original context, represents a member of Japanese society's personal feelings, desires and beliefs. In a narrative context, one can identify honne as *true feelings and desires* or that of *truth in self*
		- *tatemae* - in its original context, represents collective society's feelings, desires, and beliefs. In a narrative context, one can identify taemae as *truth in other*
		- In terms of practicality, the first theme that occurs to the writer should be considered the *honne device* .
		- When creating the *tatemae device*, by default, it should be in equal and direct opposition to the honne device.
		- Typically, the contextual thematic container is expressed as hanne/tatemae
		- We'll call this the ^^*h/t model*^^
		- the / or backslash represents the *thematic bond* between hanne and tateme. Think of it as the stick between atoms in the model of a molecule.
		- Another reference, think of honne and tatemae as + positive, and - negative, charges.
		- Note: this is just an overview of the key concepts necessary to understand leechseed theory.
		- The thematic bond between honne and tatemae are not always between +/- charges.
		- At other times, the thematic bond type can be of a different nature or force. We'll get to that later.
		-
		- contextual thematic container - a theoretic device that contains a single duality within. It is intended to substitute the layman definition of *theme* - a concept of human behavior that can be referred to rather than the pair itself.
			- EG: [devotion/jealousy] = Love
	- Once a substantial amount of dualities have been created, begin the process of ^^*thematic pairing*^^
	- Thematic pairing - the process of taking meaningful narrative thematic dualities and then creating a *dramatic relationship* between the two.
	- *dramatic relationships* - are volatile thematic bonds that fuels conflict, the fuel that powers a narrative engine.
