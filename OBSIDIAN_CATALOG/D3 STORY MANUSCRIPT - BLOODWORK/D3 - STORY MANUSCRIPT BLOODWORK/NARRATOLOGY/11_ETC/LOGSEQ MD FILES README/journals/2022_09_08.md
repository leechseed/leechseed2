	- This is a leech seed log research research log 2 second day 2nd day of recording as for the recordings go I think it's more helpful that I actually do it rather than keep the information it's I think it's just good for posterity though it helps me oops me collect my thoughts in in a a introduct not an entrance kind of physical way I'm trying to be too smart at the fuck but anyway after I did that as a trenthat is IAI transcribed it using the same program the Samsung audio recorder And that's another way I can take the information and put it in a text form and I could you know and take that information that way however the transcription lacks any punctuation or grammar or whatever I think what I can do is I can run it through grammarly somehow but I don't think that's necessarily priority right now but oh but that could be a solution as grandma Lee I'm gonna just try and see what that happens maybe it'll fix it up a bit it'll be like a stopgap cause it'll help me Get it to work a lot more consumable and isn't just bullshit anyway moving on to what I actually did they actually did today what I did is I then I took what I transcribed yesterday today on lock Zack and put it into Google Google sheets the reason I chose Google sheets over excel because it's free you know I ran the up and the pros and cons and the benefits and attractibles I need a better word for that excel is a robust program but Google sheets is free it's saving the cloud And I think it's a little bit more intuitive for me and it's online it's so online so it's a lot less of a headache and it works and it's free so transcribing oh transcribing it to excel was it was frustrating because I had to and wasn't as frustrating as I thought it would be it was relatively fast once I got the system going to so much a cut and pasting so so I completely took that information that information and transcribed it to excel and looking at it in this format visually I'm able to I was able to see a lot of trends however for someone to touch on Just a small details of the act of transcribing from the videos of movie recaps to log sick 1st I think I might just go straight to excel but it had to figure out what it would be like directly copying the transcript from YouTube to excel don't worry I could go seen by seeing or act by act by act in lock sec and fix it that way the issue with at least movie recaps The direct transcription to another program is that his grammar and grammar and choice choice of using a lot of prepositions however therefore a lot of extremist information doesn't really fit really fit into the format of what a beat is like a beat is a visual action or information that is very succinct almost the most admised form of film Any visual medium he goes into these very very narrative like a book of good book of describing this how a person feels right you can't really visualize that I mean you can but I would have to take that in and transcribe it into what they be is and that's kind of frustrating because at some point it's just extraneous extraneous and that part I might solve just by using a different person other than movie recaps because because clearly The goal for him and it really does not align very well for what I'm doing I mean it does it's good enough but I don't know there might be something better out there the problem with that is there's other people but I don't know how much of they're big their library is right another idea thought of is like why don't I take an actual summary written for text on a blog the issue with that is the medium is the block it's not it's not tied to a time code visually and that's what I really like about transcribing movie recaps or summaries from YouTube but anyway that's the next thing I'll do is try and see What exactly if there is another option and all the other options hopefully I'm trying to get as much done with the data and information I can create now with this type of information without adding more to it so the information I've added to the excel spreadsheet the beat count the actual beat itself the description what happens in the beat sequence and the act From visualize just look at the excel specialize and extract a lot of information and trends already and what is interesting that I've noticed that I've had some insight on is that when you go from act to act and you read the 1st beat of one act and the 1st beat of a next act I think what the the the pure definition sure of definition what of what separates an act from another act is the context of how 1 part of the story gets to the other part of the story and if there is no Possibility for an audience member to discern or you've infer discerned or infer how they got there is I feel like it's a good signal if it's a good act transition because then you can those 2 sequences are necessary to transgender to to provide context and growth of the story itseat the story itself now it escalates and that's how something like you know tension and escalating all that bullshit with the 3 act story complete comes into play And I think it's a soft soft conclusion or metric or what is it performance indicator that if one act from another act if the beats are so similar that you can tell what happened from the beginning of 1 act and the beginning of another act it's too slow tempo wise it's not moving fast enough it's getting boring and then you can translate that you know that you know I'm sorry to feel like I'm using a lot of the insight given to me from draw with your right brain about seeing The matrix didn't like how the components of a film rather than sort of the emotional tie in of Passion type to it the structure of it and how can be manipulate it in a different way and what this does it allows me to whenever I get you know riders block or whatever I don't think I'm going to treat you that the idea that ride a red Box doesn't exist yet you're gonna have to think well you're never at a point to where you don't know what to write next or you don't know what to do next cause if you don't then you have no idea what you're doing my opinion cause we aren't doing you have to be learning and understanding it more That's the basis of genius in any way I could really really manipulate a lot of the tone the mood just everything by by using the information from sequence one let's say to sequence 8 if I flip those 2 or what if I move these sequences around to accelerate the tension right like an really just use these core components just this without any of the thematic other shit this system in itself is a very simple 1 and I feel like you can really really come up with something clean a I mean clean a good good blueprint And once you do that you can go into finalized little microsist systems like theme and like an hvac or electricity or electricity or water you know these little tiny systems that dead I suggest that that a building needs but it needs a building to be built upon in terms of moving the project forward rather than other than optimizing the next thing I need to do is too is I think identify certain troops that are found in this genre that I'm working at Thriller and identify where these tropes lie after that I can go with McKee and his idea of what storytelling tools and components like the AB to set up in the payoff pay off all these other tools that are used for McKee and I could also do it from camels to your own journey or whatever that the journey of the writer whatever from that and start to apply that beat by beat seen by scene and see where those lie upon the map I can do it from probably do that on a different spreadsheet or maybe I'll try it on the same one you know it fuck it cause that it's probably best to put it all-in-one set a separating all the information is getting all the info on 1 page and then visually taking itaking it to extract information from it you know like an graph someone not and do it that way later OK yes I think that's it

	- OK 1st recording of of WeChat research day 5 so basically what I've done is I've taken the transcript of a movie called the fall or fall created by YouTube who creates these movie summary videos which are up to about 50 minutes long and what's great about these videos basically takes basically it takes to a entire like a 107 or 90 minute movie and translate translate it it to the a 15 minute format so what's cool about this is it is a really good beer bones kind of Kind of a yeah representation of what you shouldn't of what Pilar Alessandra and basically whatever screen 3 screen play play book advocates for and that's breaking things up in the ax sequences beats in and sort of not it's not a full script what it is is it's a really good beat sheet and what I've done is I've taken the transcript of it for the subtitles and minute by minute taken each of those beats kind of augmented them and adjust them to represent a beat in the sequence and an act right and so was able to do this for the whole film of the 15 minute Video summary of it and I basically was created to create an entire beat sheet for fall and then on top of that taking the architectural structure actual structure of Pilar's sequencing sin seems 1234 and then the ax structure on top of that and sort of break it down and see how it fits in that formula and I want to do this for multiple films Thomas and what kind of reason I'm doing this is it's a helping me visualize and sort of conceive and understand and process information of how This theory fits to form you know I can do it through the examples in the books or you know while I'm watching the movie I do actually taken a time and working on and doing it beat by beat it really helps me conceive of that that because going back to like when I was learning to draw the right brain of way of thinking is like I had to is a certain way you consume information and there's a certain way of understanding designing and creating information on the brain writing thing some sort of taking that theory and applying it to to filmmaking No what I want to do after this is what we're 1st ate it really helped it actually really fucking helped fucking helped because because now I'm able to see how the beats in a movie as it's playing how like actions lead into other actions Ho like a lot of the stuff mckeese has and story actually comes to form and I'm not only able to see it through insight from watching a movie but I may want to see how it flows throughout an entire movie and it's a really good at least from the summary structure wise it's a very good well made very architype of type of What is it called thriller fit's thriller film it goes under that Sean Russell right so what I wanna do after this is bringing in sharp plotting from let's see from from 4X and that's what it says or a stock trend mapping is I want to be able to take these beats and these beats and the scenes and what not in map trends as time moves forward through the movie and you know there's not just one trend line on a cover and that 1 trend line would be let's say the architypole architype of you know 3 act Story just a Campbell of 3 extra updates right I've never got to say about that eventually and I want to be able to track that but now I have the theory that there are other elements in film that can also be tracked trendwise and wise like the basic God like theme or characterization character development tempo or all that jazz and an AA location changing all these different components of the films that I can track individually over time and how I can track the Mr. Measuring the oscillations Of the end the variance is it called the intensity the of each one of these binary 1 of these binary resolutions right so let's say with like McKee's plus Hermione's theory of how how 1 plot element leads to another and how each 1 begins and ends with a plus minus sort of resolution resulting in tempo I can use thand use that with each element of film I can break it down get down to the binary of not just dialog and all these other trends of all these other components set evolve over time but then what I can do is and I can take all of these trend lines and map them over 1 another and see how each 1 of them correlate and how they influence each other And then after that I can take Trent patterns like the ones they use for Trent by tracking and seeing patterns in actual stock trading and I can complain to that and I wanted to do some multiple films but that's a whole idea so once I'm able to visualize and see how each how each element can influence another and how they represent each other on the film on film I condemn I can then understand how each component and ponent and the grand scheme and in a microscopy I can get to that just stop moments over I can write Very well and I'm not wondering too much but that's just this is the idea
