- # K/DA POPSTARS LYRICS
- Hey, hey, hey
  Hey-hey-hey-hey, hey  
  You know who it is, coming 'round again  
  You want a dose of this right now  
  It’s K/DA, uh!  
- I'm a goddess with a blade
  소리쳐봐 내 이름  
  잊지 못하게 loud, loud, loud, loud  
  I could take it to the top  
  절대 멈추지 못해  
  내가 끝내주는 bad gal, gal, gal  
  And when I start to talk like that (Like that)  
  Oh, you won't know how to react  
  I’m a picture-perfect face with that wild in my veins  
  You can hear it in my growl, growl, growl, growl  
- So keep your eyes on me now
  무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야  
  닿을 수 없는 level  
  나와 대결 원한 널 확신해  
  We got it all in our hands now  
  So can you handle what we're all about?  
  We're so tough, not scared to show you up  
  Can you feel the rush now?  
- Ain't nobody bringing us
  Down, down, down, down, down, down  
  They could try it, but we're gonna wear the crown  
  You could go another round  
  Round, round, round, round, round, round  
  Wish you luck, but you're not bringing us down  
  We go hard (Hard) 'til we get it, get it  
  We go hard (Hard), we so in it, in it  
  We pop stars (Pop stars), only winning, winning now  
  Ain't nobody bringing us down, down, down, down  
- Hey!
  You ready for this? (Let’s go)  
  See 언제든지 내 모습 magic  
  단 한 번에 내가 잡어  
  절대 기죽지 않지 uh! (Uh)  
  Pow pow 네가 뭘 알아 (알아)  
  견딜 수 없어, 원해도 (해도)  
  원하는 게 얼굴에 보여  
  I’m trouble and you're wanting it  
  I’m so cold (So cold)  
  When I move that way, you gon' be so blown (So blown)  
  I'm the realest in the game, uh!  
  Said I'm on fire with a blade  
  You’re about to hear my name  
  Ringing in your head like, whoa  
- So keep your eyes on me now
  무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야  
  We're so tough, not scared to show you up  
  Can you feel the rush now?  
- Ain't nobody bringing us
  Down, down, down, down, down, down  
  They could try it, but we're gonna wear the crown  
  You could go another round  
  Round, round, round, round, round, round  
  Wish you luck, but you're not bringing us down

  Round, round, round, round, round, round (Woo-hoo)  
  Wish you luck, but you're not bringing us down (Oh)
