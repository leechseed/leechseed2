	- ## build requirements
		- Building a direct drive powered racing wheel is an exciting project! Using a Geared Brushless DC Motor with a 50:1 high precision gearbox is a solid choice, especially for achieving precise control and good torque characteristics. Here's how you can go about connecting and utilizing this motor:
		- 1. **Power Supply**: The motor will require a suitable power supply. Ensure the voltage and current ratings of the power supply match the requirements of the motor.
		- 2. **Motor Controller**: You'll need a motor controller that is compatible with your brushless DC motor. The controller will allow you to regulate the speed, direction, and torque of the motor. Make sure the controller can handle the motor's power specifications.
		- 3. **Control Interface**: For a racing wheel, you need an interface that translates the driver's inputs into signals that the motor controller can understand. This could be a set of pedals and a steering wheel equipped with sensors.
		- 4. **Sensor System**: Depending on your design, you might need sensors (like encoders) on the motor to provide feedback on position, speed, and direction. This is crucial for precision control.
		- 5. **Mounting the Motor**: Securely mount the motor to your racing wheel setup. The mounting should be sturdy to handle the torque and stress during operation.
		- 6. **Connecting to a Computer or Console**: If you're using this for sim racing, you'll need to interface the system with a computer or gaming console. This usually involves USB connections and might require custom software or drivers to ensure compatibility with racing games.
		- 7. **Software Configuration**: You'll likely need to configure the motor controller and any interfacing software to work correctly with your racing games. This includes setting up the force feedback, sensitivity, and other parameters to match your preferences.
		- 8. **Safety Considerations**: Always consider safety in your design. Ensure all electrical connections are secure and insulated. Also, incorporate an emergency stop mechanism to cut power to the motor quickly if needed.
		- Remember, this is a complex project that involves electrical engineering, mechanical design, and potentially some software development. If you're not experienced in these areas, it might be helpful to consult with someone who is, or to seek out online communities or forums where others have undertaken similar projects.

- # types of lit editing
- **Developmental editing** (may also be called 
  structural or content) ‚Äì looks at the book‚Äôs big picture and overall   
  structure in nonfiction or plot and characters in fiction. Developmental  
  editors may assess a book idea, outline, or early draft to tell authors  
  what works and what could be better. The big picture questions need to   
  be answered first before an editor ensures your words are polished and   
  used correctly.  
- **Line editing **(may also be 
  called substantive or stylistic) ‚Äì goes through each line refining the   
  arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences and   
  smooth-transitioning paragraphs. This helps the book ‚Äúsound good‚Äù by   
  polishing the language used to communicate your story. [Learn more about line editors.](https://kindlepreneur.com/line-editing/)  
- **Copyediting **‚Äì
  corrects grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Copyediting also   
  includes correcting commonly confused words (e.g., affect and effect) as  
  well as checking for internal consistency of facts and consistency with  
  capitalization, hyphenation, and numerals. [Learn more about copy editors](https://kindlepreneur.com/copy-editing/).  
- **Proofreading**
  ‚Äì a final check before publication to find missed typos, missing words,  
  repeated words, spacing and formatting consistency. Proofreading should  
  be the very last level of editing. [We have a comprehensive post on proofreading marks as well.](https://kindlepreneur.com/proofreading-marks/)
