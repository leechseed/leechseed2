- Alright so this is leech steed 11 research log research log and I spend a while since I done one of these be like 2 days but I'm halfway through the theme enslavement and mental anticipation from Bloom after this do this I think it's sexuality but after that I didn't have to wait done through the themes the themes I've decided instead of going deeper into plot because I've never really felt right I think the best thing to do is to move outwards again And just really trying to get a good grasp on literary theory of what exactly that is for me and my writing so I downloaded like 3 books from Norton and norton's anthology and I think I'm going to also go in depth with the theory and criticism booked and I got from before in college I have that downloaded I think the idea will I'll have to use those out to reference Maybe pick up some small points but then maybe use something like Wikipedia to sort of fill in the blanks just so I can get the basic idea and when I need to go in depth or something I will go in depth I that's older I don't need to go in depth for every single thing all the time because that's just an efficient and my brain can't you know process all of that the cognitive load and everything I'm really just getting overviews of a lot of things and and how it all fits together they're just taught with the liberty theory literary theory I think that's what I'm really trying to go for with the golf go on Twitter literary at 3 theory Ami don't think is it's how deep in with everything else I know already have that done with Narrative narrative fuck design but bell is like it's a very smart record of view of literature rather than an an actual dive into what it is so I can use him as supplemental when it comes to literary theory and then I can construct I can construct again my own sort of grand grand architecture to put all of it together Place that would be the idea so I read one of those books finished this up for finish up shut up mantipation and slavery and then also do sexuality tonight I'll be glad those 3 books yep that's it

- Leach seed 10 research log oh my God bro it's getting tough I just did the the book for death and dying from Bloom and manda shit was rough but what's great is that my theory of how all of these themes are connected are connected and can be controlling themes and sub sort of assistive themes and sort of flavor enhancing themes I guess the way you can look at as a stock because of the stock there's a base labor like a chicken stock but then there's aromatics of Let's see here you know Mariposa onion onion carrots and celery and then you have your herbs which is an add a little bit more depth to it as well like a why don't the amiya SSAA verb so like these are like all sort of a full bodied flavored theme so to speak and that's what a good stock is right and and that's sort of what you need you don't understand that topos which is the I can kind of structure it like that like a pot Of a stock where the topos with a topo is the controlling theme and the 3 and silly everything matters that couldn't be present within the film and I couldn't further break those down into possibilities and examples of what other books have done and those getting body characters in such and not just characters but you know and from here I on I can take this stock and put it into the sauces of anything really and that's like my base use of what theme can be used on for everything else this base stock I think that's really what the next step is that's something I can model I think Aside from that I also I've learned that I also research or added a couple books to theme once I've already got my shelf in there conceptually conceptualization of what theme is and and a lot of it is reinforcing they all reinforce each other which is great along the lines of what Bloom says and whilst while I'm something like the Gotham workshop is pretty fucking basic and bullshit A lot of not saying anything without saying something it's not very great for guidance great for guidance and I really should take that shouldn't take that for granted to where I really need to face a lot of my research not necessarily it books out the bookshelf but but those that are based on academic and actually literary journals cause that is where like a lot of the real meat is while the other one just kind of dance around defining what they think it is and I think I really need to go to the source so I can go to the store so I can carve away what I need to As opposed to trying to figure out what the fuck these people are trying to say from these basic books it's basic books which kind of like it's kind of like fucking foils half my library but you know whatever it is what it is shouldn't really talk the last couple of days I don't know if I'm burning out or just dressed I mean not actually I think it is stressed because I've had to do the whole shit with the hotel at a whole bunch of new activities activities to my Clean up my personal hygiene schedule I've also been trying to do this shit with my fucking video collection so I think I am trying to just do too much anecdote Butch I'm gonna calm down I'm kind of Lucy goosey Louis cannon right now kind of fire and everywhere without any focus I think I need to do is just focus right just to style back down get back into it was great with spider man as I would like I was able to play that game and it was like that and then my work and then like jerkin off so I feel like I need to find that 3rd thing To disorder relax me and don't back into those sexuality books I think that's what I'll do do more research in that same type of thing keep the sort of cognitive load on a simmer let it kind of rest a bit and then doubt be back into it where's tough as like just really dealing this mountain a theme I think I still have more than half to go But one book at a fucking time man maybe I'm getting 2 done today if I get 2 done today I'll be more than halfway down Jesus I'd be amazing I can't wait to get done I need to make these notes I need to make the notes I need them what I'm going do something to create another document beside side my my on theme notes called my sort of analysis on theme and then from there I canevertheless I can create models and from there I can create a methodology And while this sounds like a lot I don't think it's a lot cause I already have it in my head I need to put it on a paper so that I can review it and study it and and really put it as part of the structure of building something doing something I'm keep it short that I'll be up for today see you
