- Uh uh I'll eat seed 64 river restocked on the attic I'm going back and just revisiting my note taking stuff I'm trying to reemphasize the point of patience it's just really dawning and a developing at least this form of passing I sing so let's see here I'm thinking the next step right now is to sorry I see I forced the several problems right now like one I have been lost in the sauce where everything is 1 thing I can start doing is actually labeling a lot of these passes versioning Just start by saying vocab vocab vocab vocab you know I've looked at light because it's like oh keywords only as keywords and then I'll say key shit key sources for books and repeat key sources and the key individuals atom I start doing that seems a lot more yeah keywords key sources key people shut up you like the green pass Right wow well one will be keyword key sources when color will be key sources 1 will be key individuals and 1 will be key people are keywords and then I get labeleach following pass it was green based on what pass it was like it was at 8 o'clock that I labeled that book right and then beyond that What I can do there as I feel like the last pass for everything would be key workey words keywords because almost keywords are like the most basic form of the language type and understanding is knowing the keywords of whatever it is I'm doing but that's how we'll do it aside from that I'm gonna take a break from doing the Strategic document when it's gonna let that slide for a bit I would do want to develop the research search document I just start collecting that whatever it is I just don't note none of this fucking Lord and there's too much Lord to put into it right now just to say it's to fuck it you know just just get it all down for now just something to work with we'll use that 1 program we've been working out for documentation What else I did have a conversation about the world I'm building about the sort of different races of people and how for the dwarf metaphor I wanted to use the rodents as a form of the dwarf metaphor like hamsters and Germans and all that jazz I'll be pretty coolet's see here I feel like I'll be the only ones from Earth maybe they're actually on the moon I'll see they Ireland there is a hollow Earth actually like that the only ones that are appropriately from Earth because there are quite little underdogs I thought I'd use them as and they really fit well with humans especially in the priorities they can be very isolationist entirely isolation list and I feel like one of the biggest things that they could solve together It's a network together is there sharing of resources and them both working together to build a better like maybe if they work together they are the ones that kind of push forward towards a better future and they explore the Galaxy together something like that I guess I'm saying I think I'm gonna keep this one relatively pretty punridiculously short or I'm pretty sure it'll probably be doing after I'm done with everything but anyway that's it
