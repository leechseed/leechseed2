	- A god-tier weapon roll for every variation.

		- 1) Primary Weapons - god-tier roll of each weapon class
		- 2) Energy Weapons -  god-tier roll for every energy type
		- 3) Power Weapons - god-tier roll for every
		- 4) Dark Rise Priority - rolls that fill **shadow type/energy type**

- # Loadout Theory
	- ### Crowd Control Rating
		- Range is the distance of a weapon's effectiveness.
		- *__Crowd Control Rating__*  - A rating of efficiency based on a weapon's ability to crowd control. Rating determined by sentimental analysis and *crowd control ratio*
		- *__Crowd Control Ratio__* - a ratio considering range/fire rate with emphasis on sentimental analysis
		- **Sentimental Analysis** - how a weapon feels according to the user. Meant to substitute several other weapon attributes in exchange for decision efficiency.
		- **Rating Spread**
			- A-tier
			- Meh-tier
			- Sucks-tier
	- ## CCR methodology
		- For your loadout, one must consider crowd control in Destiny 2.
		- Mobs consist of a majority of the enemy class type in any given situation.
		- Bosses and Mini-Bosses are considered extremely dangerous however, and should be targeted for elimination.
		- Thus the dilemma.
		- How does one equip their loadout to effectively eliminate mobs at a rate which allows the guardian to focus the *initial target* which are the bosses?
		- **For now we'll stick to this paradigm** - *A1 Always....*
		- *__A1 Always__* - you always want an A tier CCR  especially in encounters that you first meet.
	- # Loadout Methodology
		- #### Kinetic/Primary
			- **Initial**- **Chosen weapon must be balanced against the Energy Weapon's CCR**
				- IE: if Energy weapon's CCR is shit-tier, Kinetic's must be A-tier
			- **Secondary**- **Chosen weapon must compensate against Energy Weapon's Shadow coverage**

		-
- # Current Inventory
	- ## Current Initial Priority Goals
		- ### Kinetic weapon inventory must account for shadow coverage/purple rarity coverage
			- Due to energy weapons primarily focusing energy type/shadow coverage, kinetic weapons must compensate for weaknesses.  An inventory that consists of full shadow coverage enables agility decision making.
	- ## Energy Weapons - Initial
		- Void Pulse Rifle - *Graviton Lance*
		- Solar Hand Canon - Sunshot
		- Striker Submachine Gun - *Riskrunner*
		- #### Energy Weapons - Secondary
	- ## Kinetic Weapons - Initial
		- ### Shadow/Purple Coverage
			- Auto Rifle - *Krait*
			- Hand Canon - *Survivor's Epitaph*
			- Scout Rifle - *PERSES-D*
- # Current Loadout
	- ## Kinetic Primary
- # Questing
	- **Bounties**- the objective with bounties is to efficiently complete them which means to work on multiple bounties that overlap objectives
		- max bounties is 7
	- **Hive Knights** - are on the moon
	- triumphs
	- seasonal rewards
- # Best practices
	- efficiency
		- when choosing an activity, maximize the return by leveraging **bounties**, **triumphs**, and **seasonal rewards**
	- strategy
		- before embarking, create a plan for the next two activites at least
		- have a grand plan in place, at least the next two activities planned, the next two actives with loadouts? mapped?
	- travelling
		- when moving from planet to planet, better yet if possible break it down into the most efficient form, a list of directions
	- other
		- its much easier to use controller when taking notes. more efficient that is
		- wait till you complete the entire activity plan before looking at inventory. it wastes time
