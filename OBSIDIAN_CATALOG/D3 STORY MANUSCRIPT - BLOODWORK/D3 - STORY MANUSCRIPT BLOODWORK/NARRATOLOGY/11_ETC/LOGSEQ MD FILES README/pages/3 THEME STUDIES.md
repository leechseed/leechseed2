	- ## **Bloom's Interpretation of Alienation**
	  collapsed:: true
		- ^^*__In Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche taught us a certain kind of contempt for the very act of speaking, since that for which we can find words is something already dead in our hearts.__*^^
			- ^^**_Contempt_ - Self-hatred or loathing for oneself.**^^
			- ^^**_for the very act of speaking_ - vocalizing outwards, or communicating with another.**^^
			- ^^**_for which we can find words is something already dead in our hearts_ - the concept of communicating outwardly to another is akin to meaninglessness.**^^
			- **My interpretation:**
				- ^^**One cannot simply talk casually when they are at war with themselves.**^^
			- ## **^^The tragic duality of Alienation:^^ self-hatred, self-sufficiency, and self-strength vs selfish, self-centered, and egocentric.**
				- ^^**The Hero or The Self - is at constant battle with themselves. They are unable to see the effects of their behavior in the outer world.**^^
				- ^^**The World - is at constant battle with the unknown. They are threatened by what they do not understand. The unknown is therefore seen as an untrustworthy wielding of immeasurable power.**^^
			- ## Powerband
				- ^^**The Self _does not understand itself._ The Self is *weak***^^
				- ^^**The World _does not understand the self._ The World is *fearful.***^^
