	- As we leave footprints across the internet when we are looking at websites, liking social media pages or messaging friends, our digital privacy has become more of a concern. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzwbad4nhc32e3fhe2zk9rm))
	- We probably should as they explain how our data is used. But the challenge is, even if we go ahead and read the T&Cs, we’d ignore the details to gain access to the service. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzwbps6qc6kkhz0449xagry))
	- This is known as the privacy paradox where we realise we’re giving away our digital data, but do so in return for gaining access to the platform (see [Chapter 6](#None) for more on the privacy paradox). Perhaps an alternative approach is needed such as nudge theory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzwbtd0f61y52sxzewewvdj))
	- Nudge theory was originally proposed by Professors Thaler and Sunstein in 2008. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzwbyjt7epzs899f3ckgzt1))
	- Rooted in psychology, the idea was that someone could be gently encouraged or nudged to do something, rather than being forced, if choices were presented in a different way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzwc3zvmwyw513n4kthw3vr))

	- Privacy is complicated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzwd75n51mh97a1rse7k3nt))
	- n older article by Daniel Solove suggested that privacy could be invaded in many different forms (Solove, 2011). He noted that the focus seems to be on hiding bad things, rather than retaining or protecting private or personal things you don’t want to share. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzwd9s59r5tx1b4485qgcwh))

	- This is a step change which Bardhi and Eckhardt argue has partly occurred with the increase in the digital economy and that consumers, in some cases, place greater dependence on digital access than physical ownership. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx4k2188qgfkw7b93vvs22))
	- The absence of physical goods, or fluid consumption, is known as dematerialisation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx4qkn5y42e3dnwtfx3req))
	- nstead of acquiring items, we consume in a digital setting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx4szbvzhfdm9059yy0q01))
	- One other issue is digital clutter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx51v5mt6kcj7g1evav494))
	- Another change in our behaviour is that we share items owned by others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx59h5t4911t5ca9ghfj75))
	- his is known as the sharing economy, which involves a temporary peer-to-peer exchange accessed via technology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx5da78ze0pj04jvbtg5b9))
	- The exchange needs three parties: the platform operator, the provider offering the service and the consumer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx5ghecgm5mc5cnrf8cen7))
	- It has been defined as ‘a consumption-production mode in a city, in which value is generated through transactions between actors (both organisations and individuals) involving temporary access to idling or underutilised rivalrous physical assets’ (Voytenko Palgan et al., 2021, p. 1) and as ‘a scalable socioeconomic system that employs technology-enabled platforms to provide users with temporary access to tangible and intangible resources that may be crowdsourced’ (Eckhardt et al., 2019, p. 7). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx5tm6b1dw2k40rmwjbw0h))
	- According to Eckhardt et al. (2019), the characteristics of an organisation in the sharing economy are based on: technology, the changing role of consumers as prosumers, money for the service, the temporary nature of the service and crowdsourcing the supply. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx6cpd9vt5vv1hrwmjtyvp))
	- The sharing economy only works with technology, often via an app, which is why this is considered to be part of digital disruption (see [Chapter 1](#None)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx78b4vm061znxq643vq55))
	- The technology needs to be easy to use for both service providers and consumers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx7bzajwtfa77t5yvm3n82))
	- Although Eckhardt et al. (2019) argue that money must change hands, this is not always the case. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx7gj2ten98x13ckcr4040))
	- et, there is always an exchange which can involve payment, in the cases of Uber and Airbnb, but there are other exchanges too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx7m35k0gk2etnsaqm5d4s))
	- n the sharing economy, the connections are not one-to-one but from many-to-many which involves the crowd – wider groups that wouldn’t normally find each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx7w8absnr14dzzvgkjg3v))
	- Instead of sharing with neighbours, you are sharing with strangers; this is known as **collaborative consumption** (see **Discover More**), which has been described as ‘people coordinating the acquisition and distribution of a resource for a fee or other compensation’ (Belk, 2014, p. 1597). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx8bm86ftt7sprqztzb2c2))
	- Two of the success factors for collaborative consumption are: (a) critical mass so there were enough people signing onto the platform; and (b) social proof as potential community members heard, saw or read about others using the platform (Botsman and Rogers, 2010). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzx8ghx3byqxn2n5b3hwhte))
	- Researchers found three main reasons why people participate in the sharing economy: to save money, for the social interaction as part of a community, and because they understand sustainable consumption and want to do good within society (Hallem et al., 2020).

	- Customer experience management (CEM) considers the entire customer experience, whether offline, online or blended, such as the showrooming and webrooming examples. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxbk5swwqbhe4bj7mwyykq))
	- Although we talk about customers and consumers interchangeably, customers are those who make the purchase (in B2B they are clients) and consumers are those who use the purchase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxbvy62ds2fqpas4hn3r06))
	- There is no agreement on what customer experience (CX) means. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxc9g66gx435cez98ybgh7))
	- Described as ‘a multi-dimensional construct that involves cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensorial, and social components’ (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016, p. 70), this construct covers many bases from online to offline as well as virtual. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxcm3xmvwdexm0s8mv5ntx))
	- Differences between the idea of customer relationship and experience management are what a customer thinks about a company, the times when this happens and the touchpoints that are encountered (Meyer and Schwager, 2007). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxd4awrvkhxbkx4gfpffh6))
	- This is where we start hearing ‘touchpoints’ – the interactions between organisations and customers that occur in multiple channels. Lemon and Verhoef (2016) proposed four types of touchpoints: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxd8n5w0k2mw1ftqd47w8a))
	- **Brand-owned**: managed by the brand such as its website or advertising. Brands can pay for keywords you might use to search for their products (see [Chapter 3](#None)) to make the customer experience easier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxdpysa0brhnaz4wy8b1ab))
	- **Partner-owned**: jointly owned by the brand and a partner, such as appearing on an affiliate or other website. Brands still control most of the content within the restrictions of the brand site, such as Tripadvisor®. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxe67cjfsj8qyvkqa6wzgw))
	- **Customer-owned**: actions controlled by the customer, such as their choice of payment (credit card, Apple Pay, PayPal) or the device used to access the website or app. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxej1prpada070qq4w8yh4))
	- **Social/external touchpoints**: content appearing across social media or other external sites such as review platforms. We know that we read and assess reviews and they are an essential factor when making purchase decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxesqstxnzrn9dh85qx0dy))
	- When moving through the customer journey, customers both use and are exposed to multiple touchpoints. These have direct and indirect effects on their purchase and other customer behaviours (Lemon and Verhoef, 2016). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxf21snct3q7tcjj62esr4))
	- If a touchpoint has a negative effect, such as the consumer abandoning the shopping cart, it’s important to understand why, so that it can be remedied. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxf4kpd39ckq9kkhnr092r))
	- A variation of the customer service experience is the idea of customer service *encounters*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxfesy4n0agnffz8j3k20y))
	- A study suggested that the difference between service encounter and service experience was about the period of time the service lasted (Voorhees et al., 2016) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxfkra65hskbrqnvzx5rsx))
	- An ongoing or continuous service was an experience, whereas a specific service was an encounter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxg4vz82p4jz8p8dw6vsbt))
	- The encounters were divided into three phases: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxg7y18xnn7vj4t3s3e9ky))
	- Pre-core service encounter – the time before the main service where the customer engages with the firm and seeks information such as online reviews ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxgc1kbnd6egppf4wtkj25))
	- Core service encounter – the time at which the primary service is provided. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxgf5dt1sf4kqpjr2z7839))
	- Post-core service encounter – the time after the service has been received where the consumer reflects, assesses the service and may complete online feedback. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxghrb4y2p4g6hhbpzra7z))
	- A popular way to measure whether customers are satisfied with the service encounter is **Net Promoter Score**® (see Key Term). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxh9y68tp9adtwdrz72q6h))
	- Key Term Net Promoter Score® (NPS) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxhda8h7c0w2s20ax5gmxm))

	- In B2C consumers could search for online reviews or look at the company Instagram page to see the shared comments. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxkqjyh3m0xczrz67hsajk))
	- If this stage is not successful or the touchpoints are negative, the search may be abandoned, or another brand selected instead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxkwdqvc1n5dkep4raz43f))
	- Stage 2: Purchase or conversion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxkzjn665qx4c91dqk3nah))
	- If the pre-purchase stage is successful, the consumer moves towards the purchase stage, often known as the conversion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxm3e1r4pntzzh5veb6rrz))
	- The purchase stage concerns all customer interactions with varied touchpoints during the purchase: the online user experience, ease of purchase, delivery choices and confirmation of delivery if relevant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxman5axe01qj9barbgvte))
	- The experience of the purchase process is another factor. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxmjcbp0ehfy0rkmd9ke86))
	- We may think of a customer journey as a visit to a website to buy a product, but in some cases no physical or immediate purchase is made because a customer journey can involve conversion actions including: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxn5tmzt8s5jc9c8tdz7n6))

	- Registering interest or support ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxnq7tg4p36pf1mfytxn6g))
	- Buyer journeys are often used in commercial organisations where the goal is an instant conversion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxnwv57g1s0tvs1c76pzn9))
	- The final stage, which is a newer aspect found in digital marketing, is the post-purchase stage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxp1atpn0mvr1y0a0epny6))
	- According to Lemon and Verhoef, this comprises behaviours such as usage and consumption – you bought it but did you use it? Did you leave a review? Sign up for the newsletter? Share the purchase with friends? Again, the customer experience of how the process was managed is a contributing factor towards future purchasing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxp8znafzwhbqewb8zrqrr))
	- The digital environment has provided consumers with access to greater choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxpf8ef853jcf5vzp4hsfy))
	- Customer journey mapping is generally acknowledged to have been devised by Barry Kibel (2000) where he suggested that results mapping could be used as an approach for assessing the work of social, health and education programmes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxqchnsnv6ytk0nh8f664f))
	- Let’s examine an online customer journey, step by step, that I’ve mapped out and which is shown in [Figure 2.2](#s9781529782462.i490). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxqm7f78ahchwhkb5rgd9r))
	- This online customer journey is based on buying a laptop – not an everyday purchase and one that requires some investigation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxqs5z31je4vdxpgsb6wv3))
	- the first step is identifying a problem or a need – perhaps your laptop has broken and you need a new one. This is the beginning of the pre-purchase stage which is often the longest part of the customer journey. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxrb2svpx23z3xrjbjd8t1))
	- The pre-purchase journey usually starts with an online search, adding words into a search engine – in this case using the words ‘laptop for studying’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxrs15ftdq0qmnk042yx2s))
	- With millions of shopping websites available, this provides too many results and you refine the search terms and add more words; for example, ‘lightweight laptop for studying with good battery life’ or ‘laptop for studying with touchscreen’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxs8peshsc1t3bdgm9hcy9))
	- These are known as search terms and the results are based on the keywords and key phrases used (see [Chapter 3](#None)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxse0pqvsw9ctf8sddgb37))
	- These are partner-owned touchpoints which may be controlled by Google, Bing or Baidu – whatever search engine the customer chooses to use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxstp9b7fzbk4h8dnegk5b))
	- You explore the search results further, but you seek social or external touchpoints by asking friends for recommendations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxt05rdcp0y8msfqztxt5v))
	- From this you start to search for specific brand names. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxt32gmyzg2c34qchvjb5v))
	- Perhaps you knew the brand you wanted and visited its social media to read feedback from other people? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxtk1wgjtyfs4bnajek4t6))
	- If not, you might look at review sites or comparison sites where they have star ratings for the different products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxtpxefk68xb020243mhgg))
	- When you’ve read the reviews and gathered more information, you create a shortlist – that’s the first decision, as you have removed some of the brands from your potential selection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxttykfq6j3ypb3myb5yfd))
	- If you haven’t already, you might explore brands’ social media pages and make the next decision as to which brand to select. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxv2s3264d8qwymz88hg5m))
	- You move into the purchase stage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxv71vdb2b7gk3qf8xdbg8))
	- ou’ve decided to buy, you’re ready to spend some money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxvc59ckygvsp6n5ne6vkm))
	- The next decision takes place, which often involves brand-owned touchpoints such as its website, and the purchase is made ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxvjhtp9z1j9rr0y6d2a1v))
	- When the laptop arrives, there is another decision or customer-owned touchpoint – to keep it or return it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxvns44bm4zf7v6ph6a660))
	- Finally, you reach the post-purchase stage and may provide feedback, add a review or share on social media, contributing future social touchpoints for other consumers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxvs8qkczwv1s0e624946f))
	- This seems logical although there are some back and forward steps, so there may be steps missing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxvx5xkztatf7qe6013zyj))
	- When discussing customer journeys, researchers David Norton and Joseph Pine described them as ‘the sequence of events – whether designed or not – that customers go through to learn about, purchase and interact with company offerings – including commodities, goods, services or experiences’ (Norton and Pine, 2013, p. 12) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxwc5k1fm510gyeajhdq1c))

	- Another type of customer journey mapping is path to purchase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxx09krskd3ynjh0zjqa6x))
	- Borrowed from computing terms, path data contains information about a user’s search behaviour, interests and visits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxx6x92kkr9mrsgyy1stvb))
	- In marketing parlance, the ‘path to purchase’ concept is similar to a non-linear customer journey; the difference is trying to attribute the elements or touchpoints which have had an impact on the journey. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxxnxhqhqbknszczxh5395))
	- A web cookie is a small piece of data that is stored temporarily or for a period of time on your device when you have visited a website. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxynegsjqrh5152qs1ken0))
	- There are two kinds of cookie: (a) session cookies, which are temporary whilst you are browsing and do not store your data; and (b) persistent cookies, which remember who you are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxyrsmxw9z4n5357m50h5e))
	- One of the greatest challenges in the online customer journey is when the organisation does not know how the customer arrived at the site – this is known as **dark social** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxyz9dwcknp9db7yvfqz3w))
	- Dark social matters as marketers need to know what drives traffic to a website. In the pre-purchase stage, what’s the most effective method of gaining new visits? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxzf7r0q56cqzv4r860744))
	- Key Term Dark Social ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxzv76zzta34mqfva8fd2m))
	- Dark social occurs when the tracking information (metadata) to report on the source of the visitor is lost. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzxzzpzt5cepkvy831h7kzm))
	- This occurs when a new customer arrives at your website, but you do not know how they heard of you – the source of the visit or relevant touchpoints. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy03ceeth5h9cex2p2nv1g))
	- Historically, we considered customer segments or segmenting of marketing into groups. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy0gwextdn5gpkhpgcdqcj))
	- Customer segments divide customers into groups based on demographics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy0p0q88nmcbja08dzwvdg))
	- ersonas take this further and consider the emotional elements (psychographics) and online behavioural (webographics) which is why they are more relevant in a digital marketing context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy0t56gn1091n1vpe8szf5))

	- That’s where personas are invaluable, allowing you to step into the shoes of the customer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy1kkqp2x60a6s9hdpzw1m))
	- The first step is to collect and analyse data about the customer groups ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy1sq4ae8efykrvq1kbwy0))
	- he data should be genuine and secondary research such as industry reports can help. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy1xza3146cyqq9wvzhdjs))
	- ou may seek primary data, which takes longer to organise and often requires an investment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy21z2yemfp7pyf5z32feq))
	- From the data, you should extract and identify patterns of behaviour to describe different ‘types’ of user. Typically, digital personas are based on three elements, as shown in [Table 2.2](#s9781529782462.i505), which also suggests examples of data sources (see Discover More on **Demographic Research Sources**). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy299arg42p2e3jbhqaxha))
	- There are different types of consumption and many theories about consumer behaviour. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy3d6343604fzf2cdvtt54))
	- The opposite of utilitarian consumption is hedonic, where goods are purchased for pleasure and, although these are not vital, they make you happy (e.g. flowers, designer noise-cancelling headphones or a limited-edition gift set). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy3hbsh0mdtta1e44g1gd9))
	- Hedonic purchases may take place on specialist ecommerce websites, luxury private sales websites or invitation-only apps. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy3ne3hs7vbswqmbpt6hb8))
	- The purchase may be limited by your resources: your time and money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy3tqbqstew8vv5ypgqt72))
	- The time you have varies depending on your life stage; for example, whether you’re a full-time student, or if you’re working, or a part-time student juggling family, work and studies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy40h67b5z91sf8ptxqgap))
	- Another layer of consumer behaviour is derived from personality traits such as being adventurous, being cautious or seeking excitement, which influences whether you plan your purchases or impulse buy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy47jvebn2169dg0yq73eh))
	- mpulse purchases can be utilitarian or hedonic and it may be that you’re watching a live streaming video, looking at social media and participating in social commerce. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy4d1410ece4sbcahbkb2s))

	- Davis explained that a TAM should discover the impact of external factors; and so the model starts with the external variables which could include items such as individual or group training and user guides. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzy6n716xpq7eqxxh4m0szv))
	- The flow of the model is shown in [Figure 2.3](#s9781529782462.i518) and this initial framing from the external variables contributes to perceptions of usefulness and ease of use, which in turn lead to an attitude toward using the system.

	- Regardless of the type or purpose of the website, user experience and usability are key factors that ensure visitors return, or not, to your website. The next section looks at these concepts in more detail. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzyzgfq8d2ajed7ff5vpjeh))
	- he foundation of user experience (UX) in websites came from usability (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006; Law and Van Schaik, 2010). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzyzq1gdjjf7dh6r7ejxv60))
	- This element of UX is to discourage the development of complex websites that are difficult to navigate and take too long to load and are more likely to be abandoned. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz0662xpewva6cjtxd35ve))
	- A key aspect of usability is ‘made for the medium’ which considers whether the website adapts when it’s being viewed on a desktop, tablet, mobile or other device. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz0qzhqds3j9p7dzg314xy))
	- Non-instrumental, aesthetics and pleasure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz1006svg9axc1npfqa86m))
	- Website aesthetics consider if the content is pleasing to view. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz13dwmggp467rws8y2y6j))
	- For Steuer, vividness was concerned with the richness of online sensory characteristics and how far technology could stimulate multiple senses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz1bv3caqrv0argddk8632))
	- Steuer classified interactivity as ‘the extent to which users can participate in modifying the form and content of a mediated environment in real time’ (p. 14). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz1fzr8zfsjaz6k7yt32ca))
	- Websites are owned and controlled by the brand and they’re trying to create some form of **engagement** (see Key Term), whether that’s part of the customer journey or a response such as sharing a website with friends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz1rx8t1ng11a2be5mjaqc))
	- To achieve this response, web pages try to evoke emotion – using dramatic imagery or photos we can relate to that make us feel good or confirm we’ve made the right choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz1y4qe10f66x0bmg6wcz6))
	- Usability as a concept has evolved. It’s no longer just about websites, but also online tools including apps. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz27pzsgcey6pr3fvavpfb))
	- There are official standards produced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which focus on how websites can be understood, learned and appeal to users (see ISO 9241-11:2018) but the issue is whether organisations use these standards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz2ekbfsrxqwfqc57akab2))
	- Consumer engagement is considered as a customer’s psychological and emotional relationship with an organisation, defined as follows: ‘Customer engagement (CE) is a psychological state that occurs by virtue of interactive, cocreative customer experiences with a focal agent/object (e.g., a brand) in focal service relationships’ (Brodie et al., 2011, p. 261).

	- he pages which are shown to the person searching are called search engine results pages (SERPs) and usually show websites or specific web pages relating to the search, such as **landing pages** (see Key Term). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz3rdbweschtdapysg7xqf))
	- The words used by the person searching are called keywords or key phrases and these can extend to whole sentences, not just a few words ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz3xr3b5vpfqgqkv7ns4cj))
	- The process starts when you add words into a search engine as follows: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz42crsw2w77n1vtpp8c6v))

	- Key Term Long-Tail Keywords ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz5mv7afxrdy02jr9npmm7))
	- A long-tail keyword (or key phrase) is a longer set of words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz5txner8g724qcmbzrfp7))
	- Instead of searching for a single word or phrase, we build what’s called a longer tail – adding more words to our search string. For example, my search is likely to expand with each step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz5yye560mjjvf8daecd8s))
	- Long-tail keywords are nearly a sentence and tend to be used more when the consumer is close to a point of purchase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz62tvp2230fapgrtwr60t))
	- On-page SEO concerns the content on the web pages, the speed of delivery and the accessibility of the web page, whether viewed on a desktop, tablet or mobile device. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz6pprjczjx4mys67m67xj))
	- This is controlled by the organisation which can build short and long-tail keywords into its content. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz6tbv8v24fttbravm0bh8))
	- On-page SEO is why the content on a page is so important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz6yt60h3vzgzv7cmpktse))
	- Web content comprises many different items, such as words, images, video, headings, as well as ‘tags’ and data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz74ndqky4kpy65h2w8a24))
	- Tags are indicators of content importance and can incorporate searchable words. Most websites include space within a web page to add the tags. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz790ed6sp3dj8s5sfqp4f))
	- **SEO data tags** include meta-descriptions, meta-tags and on-page headings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz7f75nbdr76mhchex2akf))
	- Websites are written in code that search engines can read and a popular code is HTML – hypertext mark-up language. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz7xrp8qktrjyrb8nnx1xd))
	- Meta-descriptions are the snippets used by search engines in their results pages – the pieces of text displayed online ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz81v6hxvjnqnxy1be3yyt))
	- Off-page SEO relates to methods of mentioning the web page in other places. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz8eycrnd3xkrrfeh2b39e))
	- The aim of these web links is to drive traffic back to the organisation’s website. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz8r0jzmxt4196g1ps0zkv))
	- So how does it work? You need to find relevant pages to add content, such as a directory or local web portal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz92fw0hm70xnnjpkssa3t))
	- Whilst other off-page SEO is achieved through adding links to the web page on relevant directories, these might be fashion directories, or gaining blog articles – stories – on other sites. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz9dcbaa0bvf1xk74ej4kn))
	- However, because it is so important to be found in the search results, some companies adopt weak tactics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz9tf2y5ynxh89zp0ebr80))
	- Their aim is to gain better positions within SERPs and this is known as Black Hat SEO (see Ethical Insights). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzz9ym9tn2k24nggpaterp4))
	- Ethical Insights Black hat SEO ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzza2qdr048mmh9b0t0xnjn))
	- This is weak practice to gain better search engine ranking and includes: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzza646gjxnhwfx1eq4np4n))
	- Buying irrelevant links from link farms – the links connected to poor content that was often single-page websites with no connection to the subject ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzacq90k28ez0k2ej63qbk))
	- Keyword stuffing – repeating the same keywords or key phrases on web pages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzas883a0ey0sg11yzb3sx))
	- Stealing content from better websites – stealing or plagiarising content to save writing similar material ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzax50pc80kcdfz7q3aj8c))
	- These are all short-term gains as Google’s updates often penalise these unethical SEO practices ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzb0kg3npyv8zthegz77zd))
	- Search engines decide which pages to rank higher on the page based on a mathematical formula, or algorithm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzbsfq4sv9kkxgn33xp6rx))
	- hese algorithms are closely guarded trade secrets and whilst there are companies that offer to ‘get your business to the top of Google’, this is not a realistic proposition as the Google algorithm is said to change incrementally, at least once a day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzby95e53gry46za1qc103))
	- What is known is that Google rewards content that is recent, relevant and made for the medium (see section 3.3). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzcfypd35gd8q93mab35e3))
	- The concept of ‘recent’ considers the newness of the content, as older content is viewed as dated and less important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzcmt340s81bwp7vtqwga0))
	- The notion of ‘relevance’ is based on how closely it matches the search terms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzcsy04027nncf7pjvdht5))
	- Search engines identify a series of relevance signals, such as matches to the search terms and keyword frequency as well as whether the terms feature in other parts of the web page, such as in images, headings and the main content. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzd4vp8a16xqsqt9yvevkh))
	- If it’s mentioned many times on a page, the search engines believe the web page to be more relevant for the searcher. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzdhf274wya2968jcj01hf))
	- Google considers other aspects of usability such as how quickly (or slowly) a web page is presented to the viewer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzdstm9nzv9ja1rrd6qwdt))
	- ou can analyse and compare website performance, including all SEO factors, using **website performance checkers** (see Digital Tool). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzdxt7ztft9dn0rkqnze1q))
	- Digital Tool Website performance checkers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzze615yxpby5fsx13hk80g))

	- However, the search landscape is evolving and some text-based search engines automatically complete the search terms, based on a combination of predictive text, your past search history and what other people are seeking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzem5vhw4rhcsgeqwtv2qz))
	- Social media search is available via: YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzew1w5rv9h0qa3waafnq8))
	- Voice search devices include: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google a ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzf0w58bwv7zxbc1sb6ysd))
	- Voice search (e.g. via an Alexa device) is an emerging area of research. Xing, Yu and Yuan (2019) examined all the academic papers on voice search since 2008 and found just 14 articles – compare that to ‘brand marketing’ where you’ll find thousands ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzfdd1679w08k82dh8pav1))
	- It seems that voice assistants are mainly used for basic things such as simple questions and tasks (What’s the weather today? Switch on the lights!), and that there is a still a lack of trust as well as a lack of consistency between devices (PwC, 2018). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzfkh4hc6jnxhw5m3pxw3r))

	- One of the issues is the integration on the customer journey. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzg3c4t37v4ja73zsjkez6))
	- Paid search, which is also known as ‘pay per click’ or ‘price per click’ marketing (PPC), is about bidding on search terms so that your website appears before others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzgbmndc8fybxzy9q5shbq))
	- As search engines deliver organic results based on search terms, they also include adverts for organisations providing the searcher’s request. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzghqe734612hb8s62jz1r))
	- The more in demand the keyword or key phrase or target audience is at that time, the more expensive the click, view or follow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzgvaaydacxwhrypk4rxx1))
	- earch engines consider other factors such as the quality of the content on the **landing page**, the importance of the organisations bidding for the keywords and the quality of the advert content. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzh0x8p00qvm7081fdtd3v))
	- Paid search includes promotional material placed on search engines, social media and audience networks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzh87zw478m7n90x9kyge6))
	- Called CPM – the M stands for ‘mille’, the Latin word for thousand, as CPM was initially used to measure radio listeners and television viewers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzhh4zer7j9kpzkw3s6yq0))
	- The downside of CPM is that your advert might be shown to the wrong audience who cannot afford the goods, or do not have the interest being promoted, but you are still paying when they see the ad. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzhq7yg3ewm6jy6v3ccg9k))
	- CPC is one of the original methods of buying advertising online ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzhx9pt9p4c73599pazcm8))

	- A sale, i.e. a purchase added to a shopping cart or a donation on a charity site ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzjf4y96npkadzdgyv7v3f))
	- Providing email data for registration or an email list ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzjkxn1c2arkh6b9mcqvvc))
	- The CPA method works because you allow a piece of code called a **pixel** (see Key Term) to be placed on your website to confirm that the action took place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzjr70qcwp7v8zwr9kw3cb))
	- A pixel is a tag or piece of code with a unique reference that is used to track conversions and collect data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzjz17rn6bnv4n77atkp7r))
	- Pixels collect data, so when a customer visits a website page and then abandons the page to look at something else, such as a social media page, they might see an advert for the website following them – this is retargeting based on your behavioural data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzzka4fctfd5d0d86wp66ax))
