	- WHAT THIS BOOK AIMS TO ACHIEVE ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw73c3m78h8d1m80s4hwfh))
	- 2 How rowing machines work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw847xz8pp1e86e7g1wyc7))
	- This chapter explains some of the basic mechanisms and technology used in rowing machines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw8675wxg4wed89rqm89ck))
	- The main purpose of a rowing machine is to simulate the action of rowing with an oar in the water. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw88c4085dmwcw7e8s5jxz))
	- when the oar is placed in the water at the beginning of the stroke, the boat is driven forward through the water by pushing with the legs and pulling on the handle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw8jw1qs7f20q4rmpy2b68))
	- t the end of the stroke the oar is extracted from the water and moved forward for the next stroke. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw8n0edrgans6pr5nn7f84))
	- A rowing machine aims to simulate the action of an oar in the water. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw91b5b6ayq5xk0btdhfjm))
	- ‘How well am I doing?’ is a question that any user of a rowing machine will want to ask at some point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw9p5cz04pajn1pa46z4kq))
	- Within a given time, you will want to know the ‘distance’ you have travelled. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw9tx4gmp6jc51r3cq51we))
	- Keypoint ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwa5xnr4jgwasty9gsdhy4))
	- For many indoor rowers, one of the key elements of the display is the split time for 500m. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhw9zsbx1vjwf7nvhcbn34g))
	- RATE (STROKES PER MINUTE) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwa814m3v0m6q06etn7aty))
	- The rate meter works by a magnet on the seat passing over a fixed sensor, which is a coil of wire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwady5n4045kb5gd19ajtv))
	- DISTANCE ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwafrky8awca5e288brzsp))
	- The distance is measured in terms of the number of turns of the flywheel – also by a magnet passing a coil. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwan416db9qh2csr44zrwx))
	- DRAG ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwas2t4j8y4sac89em133a))
	- As the damper setting is changed to make it easier or harder to row, the ‘drag factor’ can be displayed on the screen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwb1ds7264tkn155teq18s))
	- 3 Effective technique ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwbnv6xrztpwe01fcy67vh))
	- This chapter outlines the importance of good technique and posture at different points in the stroke cycle ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwbrsd974th8bnkm50vmyb))
	- Whatever your aims, it is important to understand the importance of making effective use of the large muscle groups ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwcdbvmd78d1sfwm8794cb))
	- Whatever your aims, it is important to understand the importance of making effective use of the large muscle groups. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwcgby79gqacekfsrg55e5))
	- Keypoint ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwd56g0b4qgzts3whb4w4r))
	- Indoor rowing is a pushing sport, not a pulling sport. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwd1sdvks7nghqqgzm54v0))
	- THE CORRECT KINETIC CHAIN ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwd7msyf783qh57ywx3rn4))
	- From the crouching position to the point where your feet leave the ground, your muscular skeletal system has moved through a series of positions called a kinetic chain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwdzxzkr4hgkgkjdrbwagk))
	- using a rowing machine is not a natural action so it is necessary to learn the correct kinetic chain, that is the sequence of movements, that will maximise your effort. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhweb1as4fmbmpq2c6238v8))
	- THE DRIVE PHASE ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwecs61k86jhjazec26f29))
	- We’ll begin at the point where you start to push with the legs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwenqa63hftze6sexwexqj))
	- This is known as ‘the catch’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhweqjq42sfkrx378tvr3r6))
	- the point at which you would catch hold of the water if you were rowing in a boat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwezq4a2apwnsrh56qaea2))
	- t is also the beginning of the drive phase of the stroke cycle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwf59ha44mc4hs6n8ym4t4))
	- At this point in the kinetic chain, the shins are vertical, the back is straight and leaning forward, the head is upright and the arms are long and loose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwfeftbpannq7r6hjcvq26))
	- If you are using a rowing machine for the first time, we suggest that you try slow short pushes with the legs so that you feel the pushing action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwg2ncj4ac7vscjntx20xg))
	- Stay in a forward-leaning position and resist the temptation to pull with the arms. Think of your arms as chains and your fingers as hooks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwgbwfrmv0j593b98bzgez))
	- Avoid strain and injury by developing good posture and by maintaining the damper lever on a low setting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwghfz2qw68355vg609gnd))
	- Gradually push further back so that you are moving backwards and forwards in a comfortable forward-leaning position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwgshrx1d21p1t8rmmd3sz))
	- When you can move backwards to the point where your legs are straight, you are ready for the next part of the kinetic chain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwgwwvznvdz91hs6eh7fnb))
	- It is important to maintain the forward-leaning position until your legs are straight ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwh1qnz2r4eyqjvp0rbd5a))
	- Resist the temptation to heave the shoulders back in an attempt to pull harder – this will break the effective kinetic chain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwh92atxf4436f50twjjty))
	- The back swings from the forward-leaning to the backward-leaning position using the lower part of the pelvis as the pivot point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwhjhtq5fmt6hhm1nm102s))
	- And finally the arms come into use to draw the handle close to the chest. This is the completion of the drive phase of the rowing stroke. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwj0vdbak6vg13thaznns6))
	- In the drive phase think about pushing with the legs, ‘hanging’ off the handle with straight arms and keeping the back straight (not curved). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwj89aqd5cb0zqxa9q4f1m))
	- Swing the shoulders backwards only after the hands have passed over your knees. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwjb6pdmafyj385n5q0cg3))
	- THE RECOVERY PHASE ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwjp78ydxfgz5pmf7fd9tv))
	- The next stage is the recovery phase, well named because it is a chance to recover from the effort that has been put into the drive phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwjv4eq0q412kbg6kan34m))
	- Stage 1 of the recovery phase is simply to move the hands smoothly away from the finish position close the to chest until they are fully extended. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwk2n3pgtdyn0wqd71s4f6))
	- Think of the recovery phase as the preparation for the drive phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwkhsqmgj9kr6n1sk5s25e))
	- Next the body swings or rocks over into the position for the catch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwkqpt2yajhf2cxasxvme1))
	- The knees should not lift until the hands have passed over the top of them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwkv0qrckjvx0vjgsrvsj2))
	- you will feel considerable tension in the back of your legs at this point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwm7k59155dnqm7e8yt9p6))
	- Remember that this is the recovery phase so it is important to be relaxed but with sufficient tension in the lower back to maintain good posture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwmbp9yg82azrc0br93d49))
	- When your hands have passed over your knees, your knees lift up – but not before! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwmk88ygph6szzh0vjrwqt))
	- A good check is to ensure that you feel your hamstrings stretching before you allow the knees to lift. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwmnq8rh1rg7gt8t3ma9wh))
	- Relax the arms and shoulders during the recovery phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwmqv54frccrqtqswvzb3t))
	- As you reach the point of the catch, slow down and compress your chest up to your thighs in a controlled way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwmw0mccncgfe2jjpame6f))
	- If you reach the catch still travelling at speed, the effect will be to bounce back, placing considerable strain on your joints and muscles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwn1jfnmh6cmn0zz74gbzm))
	- The aim is to have a ‘neutral spine’ throughout the stroke; that is a straight spine in line with the pelvis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwnb56pgat6h1770x9z0cy))
	- RATIO AND RHYTHM ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwny1zy2enmag3wjbbjdj4))
	- The ratio is the difference in the time spent during the drive phase and the time spent during the recovery phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwp26qs7arfwf89xwjdgj9))
	- To work effectively over long periods you need to spend at least double the amount of time over the recovery phase (and to practise relaxing) so that you limit the build up of lactic acid in the muscles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwpcv15sbz9x3h0r6tr3zh))
	- One way of achieving this is to count to a steady beat of one, two, three. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwpkb4fsnjtdg0ahz2pp98))
	- ne beat is for the drive phase, and two beats for the recovery phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwpqdaxebwk1vby40yf68s))
	- Practise also using a four and five beat count in which the drive phase is completed to one beat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwpwkxg65zdp5w47e6enb0))
	- The rhythm is the measure of your ability to maintain a consistent number of strokes per minute. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwq2hhpz1tjh7fnryk7eha))
	- Rowing in a rhythmic manner will help you to get into the ‘zone’ – a feeling that you can row for long periods without exhausting yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwq5m50qvznqmv8p010fwy))
	- Establishing a good rhythm is the basis of a good performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwq77e8w8jddczmvb7jce4))
	- COMMON FAULTS TO IDENTIFY IN YOUR OWN POSTURE AND TECHNIQUE ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwrbqk53xz0wg1f10pr3t4))
	- Watch for the shins going forward beyond the vertical position which reduces the power of the first part of the drive phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwrh9rbx8a51xw0ka9ygs5))
	- BACKWARDS-LEANING POSTURE ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwskpjx2rrmrnmp9ey7m6g))
	- BENT ARMS ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwvr6p1nvkyj2wtc89y6cc))
	- If the arms are bent when they take the load, it causes considerable tension around the neck and shoulders, again causing a loss of power because of a poor kinetic chain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwvv69y5xb39056vk2nxd4))
	- ‘BUM SHOVING’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwvzq9mqetm124jq7j0t7m))
	- This form of kinetic chain is known very unkindly as ‘bum shoving’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhww3vn2pnd7r2c7ecpd4rd))
	- It happens at the catch when the hips accelerate backwards faster than the shoulders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhww5byp3zxjk0tbhxaz28h))
	- Your aims are to: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwwesbtsfds6jf4j92y591))
	- • row with a smooth flowing movement with the correct kinetic chain at each point in drive phase; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwwfvdvefnjzawjmcy3bp8))
	- • feel that you are pushing back through the hips, not the shoulders; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwwgs9r60r4vw0d94adya6))
	- • relax during the recovery phase and move at least half the speed of the drive phase; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwwkavejd0bs2zrgwmt477))
	- • slow as you compress the chest up to the thighs as you approach the catch and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwwntkprq92x3xcrdmbtt0))
	- • be aware of the importance of good technique in order to avoid strain or injury. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwwprpnfpempjaa903xbyn))
	- Fitness is about being able to maintain good posture for longer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwww0b5w7pcpvb73nks4bh))
	- REFINING YOUR TECHNIQUE FURTHER ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwwxs8z1ffpp1c6x9hj4ee))
	- Establishing a basic technique is the first step; the next step is to be fit enough to be able to maintain it for longer periods. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwx3rx0kze70kmnjvddwb3))
	- To develop your own technique it is important that you are able to maintain your ‘shape’ (that is the correct kinetic chain) so, initially, it is important that you do not exercise beyond the point where this deteriorates as a result of tiredness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwxjw4bng1ksh0sjv4ykjm))
	- Initially, aim for longer slower sessions rather than short fast ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwxn5531mfjdgsfsp4rxwh))
	- Check your posture in a mirror and/or work with a partner so that you can check each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwxqwcc16ws6chk32agpqq))
	- The trajectory of different points of the body is one of the keys to achieving good rowing technique on the water. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwybq1rj3n32yyy8y15gr8))
	- For example, the trajectory of the shoulders is horizontal throughout the stroke, apart from a slight arc as the body swings over at the end of the drive phase and then when the shoulders follow the hands at the beginning of the recovery phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwycy0nwycpb1c08b5qb05))
	- Any tendency to overreach at the catch, or rotating the shoulders back too early in the drive phase will result in a change of trajectory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwyt5j5bp1yys7nrbjj2xq))
	- The trajectory of the hands is also important to place the blade (oar) in the water at the catch, and to extract it at the finish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwzc5r9p3rkkhyszht9dpj))
	- he hands lift up at the catch and tap down at the finish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwzeccswadkthypmak3svx))
	- Between these points it is essential for good balance that the hands move horizontal to the water. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhwzh6x60satmg19yfngqjv))
	- FIXING THE HANDLE IN POSITION ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx05w8ww56kfsby2f11sz7))
	- The handle is fixed in position with a strong strap attached to the handle and a fixed part of the rowing machine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx0avxkq6ts1mdc816747f))
	- PUSHING BACKWARDS THROUGH THE HIPS ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx0v25hdhyfcpr2mb2arsg))
	- There is a common tendency for athletes to drive backwards through the shoulders rather than the hips – a tendency that causes the shoulders to move backwards ahead of the hips. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx1af3ndrh5y1gzkq6sjwd))
	- The ‘feel’ for driving through the hips can be provided by the athlete sitting on the rowing machine without holding the handle, and by providing some pressure against the lower back to push against. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx1g3nptzr1edp349wgy00))
	- MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH THE FOOTSTRETCHER ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx1ka8bmkv6vfw46g4mgw4))
	- This exercise is about maintaining some downwards pressure through the feet at the end of the drive phase when the body swings back and the feet tend to lift. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx1tdfhx9g1mse9sh4kzv6))
	- There needs to be good control at the three points of contact with the boat ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx22m5vnng4hvpgqbspfap))
	- the blade handle, the seat and the footstretcher. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx258c13tr020wa782kpxp))
	- If contact with the footstretcher is lost, the other two points of contact also tend to suffer from instability – which is then transmitted to the boat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx27t2mgpm69z3p07jy6m1))
	- Tip ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx2kmdc8frabdfmac2xnd6))
	- Wearing thin-soled shoes when using a rowing machine (instead of thick-soled trainers) can improve the feel of pushing off the ball of the foot. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx2e4v2xyg76bdah4fpzvs))
	- One exercise is to use the rowing machine without strapping the feet in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx2rxgn1xc0xve3j3zqnp8))
	- Rather more fun can be provided by setting a challenge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx32j40vmp9ehn0tysf01e))
	- The challenge is to hold two pieces of folded paper under the ball of the foot – and to row with increasing pressure. The folded pieces need to be set at about 45 degrees from the vertical so that if released by lack of foot pressure, they fall sideways. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx3dkm1hwdhcw48gnsf5we))
	- MAINTAINING THE TRIANGLE ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx3gn0p7acc43thktcbzy0))
	- When rowing in a boat, the triangle formed by the hands, shoulders and seat should stay constant between these two points in both the drive and recovery phases. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx3pfnxcxy2m9hfava7k9k))
	- There will be a slight change in the shape of the triangle as the hands lift at the catch and tap down at the finish ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx3ttmg95vex8dyca51n7r))
	- In effect this is difficult to achieve on a rowing machine because the hands tend to follow the downward line of the chain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx40n4bktg25wyh263276a))
	- owever, it is an important coaching point that can be demonstrated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx41mv8yzbv03wjm4vqz9b))
	- 6 Indoor rowing training for health and performance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx5ab3m5z6kp8y3rfjcg20))
	- The risk of premature death decreases as a person’s level of weekly physical activity increases (Source: 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx615yawqm05b78w2cf50k))
	- **1** Muscular strength
	    
	  **2** Muscular endurance

	- Health benefits from regular physical activity classified according to the current strength of scientific evidence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx69wtxt8swdfhe8bfhzaz))
	- A person’s overall physical fitness is then defined by how well they score in each separate fitness component. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx5rhknccjarpgg1jjk9em))
	- Researchers have measured the overall physical fitness of large samples of diverse adults and compared these to each person’s daily activity levels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx5wpn5a79xx3dv66gkzwh))
	- UNDERSTANDING THE KEY CONCEPTS OF EXERCISE TRAINING FOR HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx6yc3t5gr3zpdt44my9me))
	- PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx73zgxqncmmym44h31tw2))
	- In order to improve the physical capability of the body, it is necessary to provide a stimulus that provides a significant physical challenge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx75w7gjpxtmejxt04hdv3))
	- If this training stimulus is repeated at regular intervals for an indefinite number of weeks, her gains in leg strength will be impressive at first. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx8f3d2v2kdts5sq51x03k))
	- However, as the weeks continue the gains will become smaller and smaller until leg strength eventually plateaus. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx8hnmt4mwrsc4bcqgmpe7))
	- At this point, additional strength gains can be produced by adding more weight to the bar (e.g. 5kg) to stimulate new physiological adaptations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx871xq44m39rmb7qk6zrv))
	- This process is known as progressive overload and its appropriate application is essential to anyone who wants to improve the various fitness components rather than simply maintain a stable level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx8z9gpp9vjd0cp48rhv20))
	- SPECIFICITY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx8s78wffr9g452yk4s1e7))
	- SPECIFICITY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx8vhyy11v2me5333vc944))
	- SPECIFICITY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx91qqqkr0jyxjkyt5hq77))
	- This concept refers to the phenomenon whereby the physiological effects of training are highly specific to the type of training undertaken. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx94vqfyenxwddna3nj6bb))
	- For example, training that provides an appropriate level of challenge to the cardiovascular system will mostly result in anatomical and physiological changes in the cardiovascular system, including the heart, lungs and blood. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx9bp6w9gx0azrctgc8qqj))
	- Similarly, strength training will only develop the individual muscle fibres that are recruited during training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx9etts7e16shp9sfg2g3x))
	- The concept of specificity is of particular importance to competitive indoor rowers who wish to include cross-training activities in their regular training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx9hzrkw1c17ke75p7kh9w))
	- INDIVIDUALITY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx9qvs5wvr8yrahjrthay8))
	- This concept states that the effects of training will differ between individuals, even when they all follow the same standardised training programme ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx9vnsskygg2fdh2s4vsy0))
	- Research has shown that individual factors such as a person’s genes and initial level of conditioning can alter the rate of fitness gains and influence the overall capacity of the body to adapt to training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhx9ypksjr9eafa82jcbz5s))
	- RECOVERY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxa4sn9mky45zkrv8mjef3))
	- Recovery from training is critical to developing training adaptations. While exercise training provides the initial stimulus for changes in anatomy and physiology, it is only when adequate rest is provided in the hours and days following training that these changes occur. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxa81z0tmcy210a5w50rn6))
	- The effectiveness of the recovery period in promoting fitness gains is influenced by its duration as well as other important factors such as a person’s diet and sleep quality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxaar7ws02m2ymv1xa93a1))
	- Indoor rowing performance is strongly influenced by the amount of recovery applied between training sessions or before a major competition. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxaeksf082wa0gjj7df0pv))
	- The specific pattern of recovery incorporated into the final weeks of training before a major rowing competition is known as tapering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxajvm9xhkgmaqh5b4jbew))
	- REVERSIBILITY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxaq0kkn4h2y3fjrpc1jr3))
	- This concept states that improvements in physical fitness and performance will decrease unless the overload stress is repeated at regular intervals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxawq5snmdqyhh6189y4y6))
	- Typically, the stimulating effects of a single bout of cardiovascular or resistance exercise lasts for approximately 24 to 48 hours. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxbg4n03twv3jmd0kpjh46))
	- After 48 hours, the anatomical and physiological adaptations of exercise training decrease unless further training is performed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxbm15fwy1km9s8ns9yvtw))
	- Research suggests that most of the physiological adaptations from regular endurance training are lost within six weeks once training ends (detraining). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxbr8rjdeavdae7gpqrm57))
	- the loss of these adaptations is greatest in the first 3 to 14 days of detraining. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxby9p4qq2qnt0msh61bf6))
	- It is especially difficult to construct a training programme that balances the need for appropriate recovery against the risk of allowing significant amounts of reversibility to occur. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxc171ebxt21bx1zs6pxzs))
	- The specific technique that a person uses to achieve movement during exercise is an important training consideration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxc6ybe5hmr72varws179z))
	- UNDERSTANDING THE KEY COMPONENTS OF A TRAINING PROGRAMME ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxcb3shh3s5wsxzrv28ab7))
	- In order to help describe the type of training that will benefit indoor rowers, the overall training load can be separated according to the intensity, volume and frequency of individual sessions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxce8wwpzne7e3ex1gryrn))
	- EXERCISE INTENSITY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxcg46c930wg5gj0eqbw6c))
	- This is how hard a person is actually working in terms of effort or energy expenditure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxck459cq5v7p56kew2esj))
	- t can be described using subjective terms such as ‘moderate’ or ‘vigorous’ or through the use of a self-selected rating of perceived exertion (this is where a participant rates their level of exertion, usually using a score between 0 and 10, with 0 being a low level of exertion). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxcqwwqdshqfdk1sf85rck))
	- More objectively, intensity can be quantified using absolute or relative measures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxcvvegf5q9gt49yqcjkbb))
	- The absolute intensity of indoor rowing is commonly presented using power output (watts), speed (metres per second), pace (time over 500m) or rate of energy expenditure (kcal per hour). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxcyfs2exmcs4a0n2pq3bf))
	- Relative exercise intensity is often supplied as a percentage of a person’s maximum heart rate or aerobic power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxd44kv09hjek6btymzdvj))
	- Another relative intensity method, heart rate reserve, has gained popularity as a suitable way to prescribe exercise intensity when training for health ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxd873jvdpytxz3fq29jjp))
	- EXERCISE VOLUME ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxdae3fs2vvzt1xk3adwfa))
	- The volume of exercise refers to the amount of exercise performed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxdcq4c06bsq6r48k6yz90))
	- It is usually recorded as either the amount of time spent exercising (minutes), the distance covered (metres) or the total energy expenditure (kcal). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxde9c7r4wtgcwbrdnww6f))
	- FREQUENCY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxdgyf01z06dnbvk96rv11))
	- Frequency simply refers to how often exercise is performed and is usually measured by the number of exercise sessions completed each week. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxdhvnfkbtrxpyv2a6dc17))
	- THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR HEALTH ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxdv10fm72bbxhj7mta1qj))
	- The effects of regular physical activity on improving health and longevity have been widely acknowledged for centuries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxdxtrrj6m1evnfzah7nvy))
	- The scale of the problem becomes obvious when specific questions about health and physical activity are considered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxe5qpz6ey72mn6s91s6d5))
	- WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY NEEDED TO GAIN SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxeg0jx7y97jf018m28p23))
	- The recommended levels of weekly aerobic physical activity for most adults (aged 18 to 64 years) are displayed in [figure 6.4](#ch06fig4). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxejymcm97t3bjj8ybme8j))
	- You should aim to complete a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity every week. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxep4bczf6430w10v4p7zj))
	- It is perfectly acceptable to start off with a lower level of activity and then progress gradually toward the 150 minute target. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxex6vgsx33c3x99c54wq5))
	- lso, the standard targets may not be appropriate for some older adults (age 65 and over) or individuals with particular health conditions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxf2ja4f1m7jpmw1crdybx))
	- Initially, the targets may seem very high, possibly unachievable and unsustainable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxf9a2d0gv3s5896n0v1gz))
	- WHAT DO MODERATE INTENSITY ACTIVITY AND VIGOROUS INTENSITY ACTIVITY ACTUALLY MEAN? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxfdr5gzkn97vhce2mbr4w))
	- In order to make the guidelines as easy as possible to use, there are just two broad categories of exercise intensity that should be used. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxfn813e0yqp7q6ash8238))
	- ou can judge whether you are using either a moderate or vigorous intensity at any time during exercise by checking how easily you are able to talk, or by estimating how you feel on a scale of 0 to 10 (where 0 is sitting at rest and 10 is the highest effort possible) as follows: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxfqdwznybjj9xxhqee0fc))
	- moderate intensity is equivalent to a pace where you can talk comfortably but not sing. It is classified as a score of 5 or 6 (out of 10); ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxftvv40ha1n4btdf29vrd))
	- vigorous intensity is equivalent to a pace where you can only say a few words before pausing for a breath. It is classified as a score of 7 or 8. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxfwkhv33tj8cz2grajt84))
	- If you want to use a more objective way to check you are using an appropriate exercise intensity, then use the heart rate reserve method described in [figure 6.3](#ch06fig3), along with a suitable heart rate monitor, to calculate the actual heart rate range needed for each intensity category. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxhenwz16j1g365qagd6kn))
	- You will need to use the following information: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxhfv0fsc3t2zvbcjjqrtr))
	- • moderate intensity exercise is classified as a heart rate reserve score between 45 and 65 per cent; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxhhpnbf1s1pajg65gg73x))
	- • vigorous intensity exercise is classified as a heart rate reserve between 65 and 84 per cent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxhkchfvgn8wscc6ygwkps))
	- SELECTING YOUR WEEKLY LEVEL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TARGET ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxhq30anr2881g1xxhp613))
	- You first need to decide what level of activity you ultimately want to achieve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxhs9c10eedb9m7jw8m8nd))
	- Have a look at the information in [figure 6.5](#ch06fig5) and consider which activity category best matches your ambitions and available time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxhwe1amyg5xvkscacgrmc))
	- Be careful to notice that the indicated number of minutes for each category is based on moderate intensity aerobic activity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxj31qghnp7a9tp59c9wgs))
	- Hopefully, you will be able to work towards a medium level of physical activity or better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxk1wytretyx319ne0ntgg))
	- CHOOSING YOUR PREFERRED TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxk7mvrj8r1qgq5rnv9vdk))
	- If indoor rowing is the only regular activity that you do, you may find it hard to maintain your weekly targets on the sporadic occasion when you decide to try a different activity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxkarv7eh4z5cyz12dtr2g))
	- SELECTING A WEEKLY STRUCTURE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxkk9rk61mdwxvwesshyd6))
	- You should separate your weekly activity target time into smaller time periods to divide across the week. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxknzv82te9gyxvtdye1q9))
	- Even if you could manage all 150 minutes of weekly moderate intensity activity in a single session, this would not provide the expected health and fitness benefits since you would lose many of the physiological adaptations between weekly sessions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxkt7cyktrchvmk7fx10k1))
	- Instead, improvements will be optimised when your weekly activity is spread more evenly across each week. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxkykhhrjz16fckyzv2vje))
	- An appropriate weekly structure is anything between three sessions per week, on alternate days, to training every day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxm3j3ynsa2dqh7r64kg64))
	- Obviously, on a three session per week structure, the average length of each separate session will be 50 minutes and this may be too long for many people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxm9fbsp2ty977eykehz8q))
	- If preferred, you can increase the number of weekly activity sessions to reduce the duration of each session. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhxmd5b2nt4m0ph7sqkgrkm))
	- Claire begins her first week by adding 20 minutes of moderate intensity rowing on three different days. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy01xf159f4nvagbf6sw1q))
	- Every two weeks, Claire adds an extra 5 minutes of moderate intensity rowing to each session until she is able to complete 40 minutes per session. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy0a42brwzrfe2gcwrf7bf))
	- he then switches to four indoor rowing sessions per week, with each session lasting 30 minutes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy0h3n096vq34jk7qapm4j))
	- Two of these sessions start with 5 minutes of moderate intensity rowing followed by 25 minutes of vigorous intensity rowing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy0p8c9nvm97wmtvatz7tf))
	- The other two sessions are performed at moderate intensity for 40 minutes each. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy0wtq4841j5b0svhwnb73))
	- Claire completes 5 days per week, including a session of indoor rowing that lasts for one hour (30 minutes at moderate intensity, 5 minute rest, 30 minutes of vigorous intensity). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy14dhcyyhbpfrcbfyt46w))
	- On his first week, he does four separate sessions in the gym, including 10 minutes of rowing and 10 minutes of cycling, all at a moderate intensity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy28kx8103880pbyb4jd2x))
	- e gradually develops his rowing technique and comfort levels and progresses to 30 minutes of moderate intensity rowing on each of the four sessions that he completes at the gym ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy2e4dt8q7z7dqba6nsr17))
	- After four months, he decides to join the Concept2 million metre club (an online achievement recognition scheme organised by Concept2). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy2hxwpfetzmw914stnf0a))
	- He now rows on most days with a session usually lasting between 30 and 90 minutes and plans to join his local on-water rowing club once he has reached the one million metre target. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy2k6pgjzhg3k4r5m2pgyc))
	- ADDING STRUCTURE TO INDOOR ROWING TRAINING WITH A PERIODISED APPROACH ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy3bgj6hk3reg1e9bb6zkq))
	- An important feature of effective indoor rowing training is the use of a periodised approach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy3d8e6zq58tye5nt1t5bf))
	- Basically, periodisation is based on the idea that the physiological abilities and technical skills necessary for competition are best improved when a training programme is structured into distinct ‘periods’ of training time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy3h5kjpzstmpkjczyvnfk))
	- These periods can be organised into separate ‘phases’, which vary in duration from a few weeks to many months. Each phase has its own set of specific physiological and skill based objectives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy3k42w01wqhttxjnw5tje))
	- DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING APPROACH ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy40fdh0d9f7yvsmk1d0f6))
	- Periodised training programmes can be further divided into separate training units known as microcycles (small), mesocycles (medium) and macrocycles (large). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy445zyeka94tv2y06j78v))
	- There is no agreement about how long each cycle should last, but each one should reveal a regular and repetitive pattern of applied overload. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy47r9rk61nrq282vyvs91))
	- Summary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy4k279hbm7e5b9vz0c658))
	- In review, the key points from the discussion on training phases are summarised below: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy4faqzscypmvp2qbh1g20))
	- • Training load is determined by the volume and intensity of training performed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqhy4dx5zfbsc4nxx3jcs2zp))
