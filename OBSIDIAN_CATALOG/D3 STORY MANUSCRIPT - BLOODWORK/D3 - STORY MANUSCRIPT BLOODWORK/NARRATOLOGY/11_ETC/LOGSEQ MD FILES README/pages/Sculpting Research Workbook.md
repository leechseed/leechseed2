	- Watching the guy do his sculpting helped me considerably when sculpting the head.
	- From the day before, I was able to sculpt a relatively feminie looking head.
	- I also do like using dynotopology.
		- While I have heard a lot of pushback regarding how it fucks with you.
			- The polygon count gets too high to port to lets say Unreal.
			- However, right now I'm simply learning to sculpt.
			- I'll continue to use it once I've actually mastered sculpting.
	- The next study I plan to do is lips.
- # Head Study

	- I started with an elongated 'egg' shape with this model. I'll start with a general sphere for my next run.
		- What is important is to note the ratios of the head.
	- Unfortunately, I used object mode in this run. This is an issue because when creating shapes in object mode, the shapes are not solid. So, in essence, they aren't sculpt able.

	- The X axis perspective actually doesn't look so bad. Anotomically it looks like a real skull.
		- However, I should be going for more of a stylized look.
	- I believe this head study was good for understanding the ratios and intersecting axis' of the human head.
