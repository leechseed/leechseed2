	- ^^*__A well-defined theme allows a writer to distill the ideas, to present them in a simple fashion, to tell the story that will last longer than half an hour.__*^^
	- ^^*__A proper theme is obfuscated, esoteric, and abstract. Proper use of narrative design uses literary devices to weave theme throughout the story.__*^^
	- ^^**A method to isolate the theme in narrative pieces is to reduce the story to its most basic components.**^^
	- ^^*__Theme penetrates every form of literary device, structure, and thus narrative design.__*^^

			- ^^**Along with theme comes _arguments,_ _assertions,_ _issues,_ _concerns,_ _opinions,_ and *experiences.***^^
			- ^^**There is no knowledge without *an interpretation of knowledge.***^^
	- ^^**The layman's interpretation of theme and Bloom's interpretation of theme present semantic redundancies which can make disseminating the information problematic, especially when teaching.**^^
		- ^^**To fix this, I will refer to Bloom's interpretation of theme as _topos_.**^^

		- ### ^^**_Topos_ is knowledge and/or the subject matter of a myth.**^^

	- ## **Bloom's Interpretation of Alienation**
	  collapsed:: true
		- ^^*__In Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche taught us a certain kind of contempt for the very act of speaking, since that for which we can find words is something already dead in our hearts.__*^^
			- ^^**_Contempt_ - Self-hatred or loathing for oneself.**^^
			- ^^**_for the very act of speaking_ - vocalizing outwards, or communicating with another.**^^
			- ^^**_for which we can find words is something already dead in our hearts_ - the concept of communicating outwardly to another is akin to meaninglessness.**^^
			- **My interpretation:**
				- ^^**One cannot simply talk casually when they are at war with themselves.**^^
			- ## **^^The tragic duality of Alienation:^^ self-hatred, self-sufficiency, and self-strength vs selfish, self-centered, and egocentric.**
				- ^^**The Hero or The Self - is at constant battle with themselves. They are unable to see the effects of their behavior in the outer world.**^^
				- ^^**The World - is at constant battle with the unknown. They are threatened by what they do not understand. The unknown is therefore seen as an untrustworthy wielding of immeasurable power.**^^
			- ## Powerband
				- ^^**The Self _does not understand itself._ The Self is *weak***^^
				- ^^**The World _does not understand the self._ The World is *fearful.***^^

		- ^^*__'The Oresteian anti-hero is not, then, the virtuous man of Aristotelian description; he is, on the contrary, the symbol of a guilty humanity, the distillation of a fatal weakness in man.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'His [Williams] greatest achievement, perhaps is his definition of present conditions of heroism. For in his drama the anti-hero engages himself to suffer the agony of conscience, to confront hidden truth, and to accept the heavy burden of metaphysical guilt.__*^^
		- ^^*__'The anti-hero, in this sense, is not a man; he is a schematic presentation of extended moral possibilities.'__*^^

		- ^^*__'Although it was interpreted by Pirandello, this idea of character development should be credited to Shakespeare. Indeed, it may be described as the 'Hamlet organization:' for the anti-heroic Hamlet is perhaps the most effective theatrical example of this multiple concept of human personality.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'A study of the work of Williams would seem to show that he takes this 'existential' Hamlet as his point of departure in his organization of anti-heroic character. For he seeks to affirm in character the present; his protagonists have little real past and no hope for a future. They are locked within a moment of choice. The form of Williams is thus a record of critical instant in individual destiny.'__*^^
		- ^^*__'The anti-heroic protagonist of Williams is designed to reveal the nature of suffering as it appears in the life of the twentieth century. He is intended as the object of pity and terror in the modern world.'__*^^

			- ^^*__'The Native American trickster possesses the traits of such creatures as coyotes and ravens. Velie points out that Momaday has been influenced by the Kiowa and Blackfeet tricksters (Sendeh and Napi, respectively.) Both are benefactors of their tribes-Sendeh provides the Kiowa with the buffalo and the sun, and Napi is the creator of the Blackfeet.'__*^^

			- ^^*__'Part of the problem of dealing with any figure as a trickster is the problem of defining the crucial term. William J. Hynes and William G. Doty, in one of the best available anthologies and overviews dealing with the topic (Mythical Trickster Figures: Contours, Contexts, and Criticisms) note that many disagreements and debates that occur among scholars who have long studied the issue.'__*^^
			- ^^*__'They report, for instance, that some writers 'see the trickster as so universal a figure that all tricksters speak with essentially the same voice,' while other scholars 'counsel the tricksters belonging to individual societies are so culture-specific that no two of the articulate the same messages.'__*^^
			- ^^*__'Although tricksters are often 'comical if not marginal figures' in many traditions, 'they represent sacred beings in some cultures, but not in others.'__*^^
			- ^^*__'In these lines, Punk is no longer playing the trickster as mischievous, deceitful thief or potentially malevolent practical joker; by this point he has become the trickster as comrade and kindly benefactor, the trickster as well-intentioned messenger sent, if not from the gods, then at least from a supremely creative and benevolent mind.'__*^^

			- ^^*__'If the contemporary world involves rapid changes, perpetual complications, overturning's of the familiar, or what Alvin Toffler calls 'the kinetic image,' Neal Cassady had a way of riding its changes for thrills. Instead of worrying about disruptions of the present scenario, he delighted in the making and revising of schedules and thrived on the breathless movement from one situation to another.'__*^^

Remus explains how whites managed to wash off their blackness in a special pond, but the really memorable message of the tale is the one he emphatically repeats: 'de time wuz w'en we 'uz all niggers tergedder.' One implication of this statement-an implication borne out by the undeniable emotional power of the tales themselves-is that blacks, whites, despite their superficial differences, share a deeper bond than they might imagine.'__*^^

To this extent, it lacks the direct statement of warlike virtue encountered in the epic.'__*^^
			- ^^*__'As an archetype, the trickster is characterized in two important ways: The most well known and obvious is that the trickster subverts authority. The less frequently considered corollary is that, in order to subvert authority, the trickster must somehow also lay claim to authority and the privileges and powers it bestows. Trickster characters like Loki in Norse myth or Raven in Native American folklore are also shape-shifters.'__*^^
