	- # SECTION I The Nature of Reading Comprehension
		- ## CHAPTER 1: Dimensions of Skilled Reading: Connecting to Educators' Critical Background Knowledge
			- ### THE BLUEPRINT INVENTORY OF READING COMPREHENSION KNOWLEDGE
				- ### Student Performance and Proficiency
					- ^^Reading proficiency^^, which is ^^the ability to read words and make meaning^^, is a high priority.
					- Reading comprehension is a proxy for skilled reading and is the measuring stick by which overall progress is typically determined.
			- ### BUILDING CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE: PRIFICIENT READING
				- ### The Simple View
					- ^^The Simple View of Reading^^ is a widely supported ^^theoretical model that provides insights into the acquisition of skilled proficient reading.^^
					- This and other models ^^explain how critical processes and skills contribute to the development of reading^^ and, at the same time, suggest instructional direction.
					- ^^The Simple View of Reading^^ proposes that reading comprehension, a proxy for skilled reading, is^^the product of two factors -decoding or efficient word recognition and language or linguistic comprehension.^^
					- Decoding (D) x Language comprehension (C) = Reading comprehension (R)
					- ^^*Decoding*^^ or ^^*word recognition*^^^^refers to the ability to read printed words without the aid of context^^ , whereas^^*linguistic*^^  or^^*language comprehension*^^  ^^references the ability to understand language.^^
					- To comprehend the text the reader needs to decode the words on the page and then make meaning of the words, sentences, and overall text.
					- This model has been purposefully expressed as a numerical formula requiring both factors.
					- ^^This model is too simplistic though.^^
					- Decades of research have demonstrated that the ability to read words accurately and automatically depends on factors such as phonological awareness, orthographic awareness and knowledge, and morphological awareness and knowledge, as well as rapid automatized naming. (Each of these is defined and explained in the Language and Literacy section of this chapter.)
				- ### The Reading Rope
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670565285209_0.png)
					- ^^Hollis Scarborough^^ ^^used a rope to illustrate the development of skilled reading and created a research-based metaphor that expands on the Simple View^^ and provides a window into understanding the complexity of skilled reading.
					- The individual strands of the rope represent the contributing competencies necessary for word recognition and language comprehension while conveying the interrelationships that develop over time through instruction and experience.
					- ^^Scarborough^^ defines ^^*skilled reading*^^ as ^^the fluent execution and coordination of word recognition and text comprehension^^, both essential factors in reading proficiency.
					- Accurate and automatic word reading depends on three independent yet interrelated skills that translate into instructional components of effective reading instruction.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670565319263_0.png)
					- The language comprehension strands are necessary for extracting and constructing meaning from text; these strands work in concert with each other and also translate into instructional foci.
					- These strands of the ^^Reading Rope^^ are ^^the foundation for a blueprint for reading comprehension^^ instruction that will guide discussion in subsequent chapters.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670565379528_0.png)
					- #### ROPE MODEL
						- ^^**WORD RECOGNITION STRANDS**^^ - Connections to instructional components
							- ^^*Phonological Awareness*^^ - ^^Phonological awareness, phonemic awareness^^
							- ^^*Decoding^^* - ^^Alphabet, Alphabetic principle, basic and advanced phonics^^
							- ^^*Sight word recognition*^^ - ^^Fluency^^
						- ^^**LANGUAGE COMPRENENSION STRANDS**^^ - ^^Connections to instructional components^^
							- ^^*Background knowledge*^^ - Background knowledge
							- ^^*Vocabulary*^^ - Vocabulary
							- ^^*Language structures*^^ - Sentence comprehension
							- ^^*Verbal reasoning*^^ - Levels of understanding (eg - inference)
					- The rope illustration is a powerful visual that is readily understood by practitioners and parents.
					- It contributes to our understanding of the complexity of proficient reading while offering insight into potential sources of difficulty.
				- ### Language and Literacy
					- Although the focus is primarily on the language comprehension strands of the rope, understanding the contributions of language systems to reading proficiency is essential to overall understanding.
					- Snow, Griffin, and Burns (2006) explained, 'Literacy is a secondary system, dependent on language as the primary system, so effective teachers know a good deal about language.
					- Language is a complex, multidimensional yet interrelated system.
					- Thus, a discussion of language systems can heighten awareness and understanding of contributions and connections to reading proficiency.
					- #### ^^Language Systems^^
						- ^^*Phonology*^^ - Sounds of our language and rules that govern how sounds are combined.
						- ^^*Morphology*^^ - Internal structure of meaningful units, word formation patterns within words
						- ^^*Semantics*^^ - Knowledge of word meanings, phrases, and sentences and their relationships.
						- ^^*Syntax*^^ - Order and organization of words, phrases, and clauses that convey meaning through different types of sentences
						- ^^*Pragmatics*^^ - Set of rules that govern use of language for communication and conversation in varied social contexts.
						- ^^*Discourse*^^ - Units of language larger than a single sentence.
						- ^^*Orthography*^^ - Print or written language system.
					- All of these terms can be represented in spoken and written language except orthography.
					- An understanding of these terms is necessary to recognize connections between language systems and literacy.
					- Table 1.3 further provides insights into each system, its potential connections to instructional components, and examples of what students are expected to know and do within each.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670566273513_0.png)
					- Each student will have to use multiple language and cognitive processes and skills to make sense of the exact words and syntax used by the author to integrate ideal units, incorporate background knowledge, make inferences, and monitor comprehension.
					- These are all necessary to construct a deep understanding of the text.
					- The remaining chapters dig more deeply into these comprehension processes and skills and their connections to instruction
		- ## CHAPTER 2: Viewpoints on Reading Comprehension
		  collapsed:: true
			- ^^The ultimate goal^^ of reading is comprehension: for ^^the reader to reconstruct the mental world of the writer.^^
			- As skilled readers, this usually feels effortless and comprehension flows naturally as we read along.
			- This sense of ease is misleading, however, as it belies the complexity of what we do as we read, even when a text is simple and straightforward.
			- A whole range of cognitive and linguistic operations are at play, from identifying individual words through to making inferences about situations that are not fully described in the text.
			- ### CONNECTING READING COMPREHENSION RESEARCH TO THE CLASSROOM
			  collapsed:: true
				- The importance of language and the nature of proficient reading have been addressed through a discussion of critical factors (decoding and language comprehension) and contributing processes and skills have been introduced.
				- This chapter delves more deeply into the multidimensional nature of reading comprehension, essential language and cognitive processes, and the interaction among the reader, text, task, and the context.
			- ### READING COMPREHENSION DEFINED; PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS
				- Reflecting on a straightforward question is useful in beginning to understand the complex nature of reading comprehension:
				- What is reading comprehension?
				- Although the response to this query might seem obvious, the reply is not all that simple.
				- A survey of the literature yields varied perspectives on the nature of comprehension itself.
				- Rand Reading Study Group's Report (Snow, 2002) and its subsequent influence on research and practice, this document's definition is a logical starting point.
				- This report precisely defined ^^*comprehension*^^ as the ^^"process of simultaneously extracting and constructing meaning through interaction and involvement with written language."^^
				- Researchers in the field have conceptualized comprehension in this way--^^a complex task that involves a range of language and cognitive processes that students must master to make sense of written text.^^ (Can & Oakhill, 2007; Fletcher, Lyon, Fuchs, & Barnes, 2007; Swanson Howard & Saez, 2006).
				- Finally, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Framework for Reading (National Assessment Governing Board, 2017) views^^reading^^  as '^^an active and complex process that involves: understanding written text, developing and interpreting meaning and using meaning as appropriate to type of text, purpose, and situation' (p.iv).^^
				- Of note, ^^all three recognize comprehension as a process, inferring that a series of actions or operations are necessary to construct meaning.^^
				- At the same time, reading comprehension or skilled reading is often equated with student outcomes-products.
				- The NAEP describes proficiency at fourth grade as the students' ability 'to integrate and interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text to draw conclusions and make evaluations,' and at eighth grade, as being able to 'summarize main ideas and themes...make and support inferences about a text, connect parts of a text, and analyze text features' (pp. 63-64).
				- The following definition appears to capture many of the perspectives discussed thus far:
				- Reading comprehension is not a single entity that can be explained by a unified cognitive model.
				- Instead, it is the orchestrated product of a set of linguistic and cognitive processes operating on text and interacting with background knowledge, features of the text, and the purpose and goals of the reading situation. (Castles, Rastle, & Nation, 2018, p28).
				- 'The products of comprehension are indicators of what the reader knows and understands after reading is completed, whereas the process of comprehension are those cognitive activities by which the reader arrives at those products' (Rapp, van den Broek, McMaster, Kendeou, & Espin, 2010, p.291).
				- A series of actions or events constitutes a process that is critical to production.
				- If any of the actions do not occur, are interrupted, or are faulty, then the result is inevitable- a flawed product.
				- When students are asked to demonstrate understanding through a product (eg respond to varied levels of questioning, write a summary, draw a conclusion), their ability to do so depends on their access to, and implementation of, specific processes and skills.
				- These processes and skills are influenced by the nature of the text and task by what the reader has acquired and can access.
			- ### COMPREHENSION PROCESS
				- Reading comprehension is one of the most complex behaviors that we engage in on a regular basis (Catts & Kamhi, 2017, p. 1).
				- Multiple process that work interactively contribute to extracting and constructing meaning form the text.
				- What are these processes that are necessary for reading comprehension?
				- ^^Reading comprehension^^ ^^involves both language and cognitive process^^.
				- ### Language Process
					- Comprehension of written text involves processing language at many different levels.
					- ^^At the word level^^, the reader must decode individual words...access meaning of the words they hear or read.
					- ^^At the sentence level^^, the comprehender needs to work out the syntactic structure and sense of each sentence.
					- Simply deriving the meanings of individual words and sentences is insufficient.
					- In order to construct a mental model of the text, the comprehender needs to ^^integrate information from different sentences^^ to establish^^local coherence^^  and to ^^incorporate background knowledge and ideas^^ (retrieved from long term memory)^^to make sense of details that are only implicitly mentioned^^ . (2007, p. xii)
				- ### Cognitive Processes
					- The literature also attends to the cognitive processing involved in text comprehension.
					- The terms ^^*microstructure*^^and ^^*macrostructure*^^ have been used to describe two basic levels of cognitive processing involved in how readers construct and integrate meaning (Kintsch & Rawson, 2008).
					- The^^microstructure^^  of the text consists of ^^the surface code of the text; that is, the exact words and sentences (syntax) chosen by the author to convey meaning.^^
					- Right now, as you are reading this text, you are working with the words and sentence constructions used to communicate meaning.
					- Of note, language or linguistics plays a role in the construction of the microstructure; that is, ^^word meanings^^ ^^are combined to convey idea units or propositions within the text.^^
					- These^^idea units^^  ^^are connected at the sentence level through semantic and syntactic relationships.^^
					- A network of these idea units or propositions represents the meaning of the sentence(s) or surface code level of the text.
					- The ^^macrostructure^^ of the text consists of ^^a hierarchy of idea units that contribute to the overall structure of the text.^^
					- As such, ^^the textbase^^ is^^made up of connected sentences and paragraphs coupled with the underlying meanings of the text, which add up to the topic or theme of the text.^^
					- As you read this text, you are integrating background knowledge specific to the topic and connecting your experiences to further understand what the author implied and intended for you, the reader, to understand.
					- The processing of the micro- and macrostructure of a text is necessary because they both contribute to building a mental model of the text.
					- ^^Proficient readers^^ ^^construct an integrated representation of meaning rather than an exact record of specific words, syntax, or structure (Snow, 2002).^^
					- They ^^cerate a mental model or situation model by intertwining background knowledge and experiences with this text based representation.^^
					- This effortful process of aggregating successive units of meaning results in the construction of the mental model.
					- ^^Irwin (2007)^^ provided a practitioner-friendly^^model that describes five basic cognitive subprocesses that work simultaneously and complement one another as the reader constructs this mental model.^^
					- These include ^^identifying and making meaning of idea units (microprocesses),^^ ^^integrating ideas between sentences (integrative processes^^), ^^monitoring understanding (metacognitive processes)^^, ^^integrating prior knowledge and inferencing (elaborative processes)^^, and ^^organizing overall understanding (macroprocesses).^^
					- ^^Comprehension^^ is ^^a dynamic process that occurs moment by moment as the reader extracts and constructs meaning.^^
					- In addition to the identified language and cognitive processes, certain executive functions continuously play a role in making meaning.
					- Readers who work through the text are consistently shifting attention from one process to another, depending on the demands of the text.
					- Finally, Kilpatrick (2015) reaffirmed the connections between varied processes necessary for comprehension: 'A mental or situation model integrates vocabulary, syntax, background knowledge, and referential and logical connection found in text.
					- All of this has to occur within the limited attention, metacognitive, and working memory resources available to the reader' (p. 135).
					-
			- ### THE ROLE OF THE READER, THE TEXT, THE TASK, AND THE CONTEXT
				- The^^making of meaning^^ ^^occurs as the reader proceeds through the text within the conditions set by the text and the context.^^
				- The outcome is shaped by the interaction of what the reader brings to the text, the demands of the text itself, and the nature of the task, all of which occur within varied contexts.
				- In the words of ^^Catherine Snow (2010), this model^^ ^^characterizes 'successful comprehension as what occurs when the demands of the text, the challenges of the task, and the skills and proclivities of the reader are all well aligned'^^ (p. 415).
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670575985182_0.png)
				- ### The Reader
					- ^^The reader^^ ^^brings his or her strengths and weaknesses to the assigned text and task^^, including facility with word recognition as well as the language, cognitive processes and skills, and executive functions addressed thus far.
					- ^^To work with the text^^, ^^the reader needs breadth and depth of vocabulary knowledge as well as knowledge of how to use context and morphology to determine word meaning.^^
					- ^^As he or she progresses through the text^^,^^the reader uses knowledge of different types of sentences, embedded phrases and clauses, and cohesive devices contained within sentences of varying length to work with the idea units.^^
					- ^^Familiarity with discourse^^ structures helps the reader to ^^anticipate,^^ ^^organize^^, and ^^store information^^ ^^based on the text^^ .
					- The reader's global and topic-related knowledge supports the ability to go beyond the surface code of the text and understand what is implicit within the text.
					- Of note, the reader's knowledge base is particularly critical to building a mental model of the text.
				- ### The Text
					- The demands of the text influence the reader's ability to apply processes and skills.
					- In the early grades, the student's comprehension of texts typically demands more on word recognition skills.
					- Texts change qualitatively and quantitatively as students move through the grades.
					- Comprehension becomes increasingly influenced by language comprehension capabilities.
					- Simply put, this is the language used for academic purposes, the language students need to do the work of schools.
					- Texts written in ^^academic language^^ ^^contain words and syntactic structures that they are not likely to encounter in everyday, spoken English.^^
					- These, along with other texts written in academic language, contain
					- Vocabulary words that are more abstract, nuanced or technical in nature (eg fossil, theropod, evidence, etc.)
					- Longer denser sentences containing embedded phrases and clauses (eg, such as an asteroid crashing into Earth; climate change resulting from volcanic eruptions, as well as other, long-term climate changes)
					- Discourse structures that are more varied and complex
					- ^^Difficulty^^ is determined by multiple factors, for instance '^^text difficulty can vary as a function of vocabulary load, coherence, linguistic structure, discourse style and genre'^^ (Comption, Miller, Gilbert, & Steacy, 2013 p. 137).
					- ^^Coh-Metrix^^ i^^s an automated measure of cohesion that is designed to analyze texts on multiple levels of language and discourse, aligned with varied theoretical models, ranging from words to discourse genres (Graesser, McNamara, & Kulilowich, 2011).^^
					- It yields information on linguistic features associated with deeper levels of comprehension, including but not limited to, word concreteness, syntax, genre, and referential and deep cohesion.
				- ### The Task
					- A third dimension relates to purpose or the task itself.
					- Comprehension is ongoing, flexible process shaped not only by the reader and the text but also by the purpose.
					- The ^^reader engages in reading^^ for multiple reasons (self-generated or assigned), including ^^entertainment^^, ^^knowledge^^, and ^^application^^.
					- Having clear criteria for expected outcomes helps the reader set goals and adjust standards of coherence dependent on their understanding of the task.
					- These standards for coherence, ranging from literal to inferential understanding of the text, guide interactions with the text for varied purposes.
					- ^^Knowing what is expected^^, coupled with other factors such as ^^motivation^^, supports the reader's planning, the^^surfacing of necessary processes^^  including knowledge, and monitoring of effectiveness to accomplish identified outcomes.
					- Proficient readers adjust their use of processes based on the demands of the text and nature of the task itself (Zwann & Radvansky, 1998).
				- ### The Context
					- ^^Reading occurs within a broad context^^ that includes all those ^^sociocultural factors that affect learning.^^
					- The reader brings varied experiences shaped not only by ^^school experience^^ but also ^^home^^ and ^^neighborhood surroundings^^.
					- The support and resource available differ depending on the immediate environment.
			- ### CONNECTIONS TO PRACTICE
				- The reader calls on varied levels of language and cognitive processing related to the demands of the text and task to construct a representation of meaning.
				- Figures 2.3 and 2.4 represent the multiple facets of comprehension discussed thus far.
				- (The construction of meaning is depicted in two figures for visual clarity.)
				- The first represents the interaction of the reader and the academic demands of the text as the reader engages in the language process necessary to work with the surface code (exact words and sentences), textbase (implied meaning), and ultimately, background knowledge to construct a mental model.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670577020650_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670577046970_0.png)
				- Explaining and then understanding how something works is important because it contributes to a knowledge base that can lead to educational solutions.
				- Knowing how processes and the interaction among the reader, text, task, and context influence student proficiency can provide educational solutions.
				-
			- ### SUMMARY: THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE OF READING COMPREHENSION
				- This chapter focused on understanding the multidimensional nature of reading comprehension.
				- To extract and construct meaning, readers must gain access to multiple processes that are shaped by the interactions of the reader, text, task, and context.
				- Students are able to construct products by using appropriate language and cognitive processes, and these processes also determine the products' quality.
	- # SECTION II The Blueprint
	  collapsed:: true
		- ## CHAPTER 3: The Blueprint for Reading Comprehension Instruction
		  collapsed:: true
			- ### THE BLUEPRINT
				- ^^Blueprint:^^ ^^a detailed plan of how to do something^^; method worked out in advance for achieving some objective.
				- In the broadest sense, ^^a blueprint serves as a master plan or a guide for action.^^
				- More specifically, it is an evidence-based framework for delivering instruction that facilities the student's ability to extract and construct meaning from text.
				- It is not a unit or lesson plan; rather, it is intended to organize and scaffold the teacher's preparation of varied texts for varied purposes.
				- The framework can be used flexibly for reading one passage or multiple texts.
				- The blueprint calls for the use of evidence-based strategies and activities but allows the teacher to choose those that are most appropriate to his or her students and the educational context.
				- It also acknowledges the metacognitive nature of teaching by prompting educators to ask and respond to a series of questions related to the design of instruction-questions that address both the process and product demands of comprehension.
				- ### The Blueprint Components
					- Proficient readers surface what they know and connect to it before, during, and after reading.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670577844466_0.png)
					- The components and related questions presented in this visual representation are designed to support educators as they identify learning goals for reading comprehension instruction, set a purpose, organize instruction, select....etc.
					- Both Oakhill and Cain's (2012) focus on levels of language processing and Scarborough's (2001) Reading Rope provide a starting point for identifying a focus for instruction.
					- Although each of the contributors to comprehension is represented separately, this framework includes a bidirectional arrow for Before, During, and After Reading: Strategies and Activities and Comprehension Monitoring.
					- This arrow acknowledges the recursive nature of comprehension and the interrelatedness and necessary integration of these skills.
			- ### UNPACKING THE BLUEPRINT COMPONENTS
				- The following sections unpack each of the blueprint's components in turn.
				- ### Preparing for Instruction
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670586653813_0.png){:height 99, :width 450}
					- ^^*__Critical Understandings__*^^ - The blueprint acknowledges ^^the importance of curriculum that is knowledge focused^^ and also calls for developing it.
					- ^^*Enduring*^^ ^^refers to the big ideas, the important understandings,^^  that we want students to 'get inside of' and retain after they've forgotten many of the details...
					- Enduring understandings go beyond discrete facts or skills to focus on larger concepts, principles, or processes.
					- The Common Characteristics of Academic Language
						- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670585645072_0.png)
					- ^^*__Purpose for Reading__*^^ - Purpose for reading is ^^directly reflected in content and literacy goals and objectives.^^
					- ^^Comprehension^^ is influenced by ^^the interaction among the reader, text, task, and context.^^
				- ### Other Instructional Considerations
					- Other instructional considerations include the educator's use of reading strategies and activities before, during, and after reading.
					- *__Comprehension Monitoring__* The second label on the other side of the bidirectional arrow indicates that comprehension monitoring also occurs throughout the reading process.
					- The skilled reader automatically prepares and plans for learning, monitors understanding, and assesses his or her plan, as illustrated by the before, during, and after reading questions shown in Table 3.3
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670585905278_0.png)
					- Proficient readers routinely ask themselves if they understand what they are reading.
					- They monitor their understanding of words, sentences, and the underlying meaning of the text during reading.
					- When the encounter glitches, they activate varied strategies to fix the problem.
					- Those who struggle tend to have problems monitoring their understanding for multiple reasons (Oakhill et al., 2005).
					- Educators can prompt all of their students to self-question using general and then  more specific questions related to the text and problem areas.
					- Oakhill et al. (2015) provides some general suggestions:
					- Does that make sense?
					- Why did she do that?
					- Why did he say that?
					- How does this connect with the first part of the story?
					- How does this information fit with what I already know about this topic.
				- ### Text Reading Components and Evidence-Based Practices
					- Multiple teaching and learning tools exist for developing the reader's knowledge and facility with these contributors to ^^text comprehension:^^
					- ^^Vocabulary^^
					- ^^Sentence comprehension^^
					- ^^Text structures^^
					- ^^Background knowledge^^
					- ^^Levels of understanding and inference^^
					- Subsequent chapters use the blueprint as a framework to delve into word meaning, the ideas conveyed by the sentences, the role of text structures, and the importance of knowledge and inferences.
					- Multiple dimensions of each will be explored, including
					- Connections to the classroom
					- Connections to comprehension
					- Definition and description
					- Effective instructional practices (design and delivery)
					- Adapting to individual needs
					- Informal assessment
					- ^^*__Expressions of Understanding__*^^ Expression of understanding calls for the educator to design opportunities for the reader to apply skills, and consequently, ^^demonstrate their understanding of the text.^^
					- Graham and Hebert (2010) found that writing about what one is learning about improves comprehension.
					- They recommend that educators have their students write about what they are reading.
					- They indicated some of the ways this can be accomplished, including
						- Respond to text in writing (writing personal reactions, analyzing and interpreting the text)
						- Write summaries of a text
						- Write notes about a text
						- Answer questions about a text in writing, or create and answer written questions about a text.
			- ### SUMMARY: AN INSTRUCTIONAL FRAMEWORK
				- This chapter focused on implementing an evidence-informed framework for reading comprehension instruction and the challenges involved.
				- This framework is designed to organize and scaffold the teacher's preparation of varied texts for varied purposes and for different students.
				- This chapter explored the initial components of the blueprint-critical understandings and purpose.
		- ## CHAPTER 4: The Blueprint for Vocabulary
		  collapsed:: true
			- Words are not just words.
			- They are the nexus-the interface-between communication and thought.
			- When we read, it is through words that we build, refine, and modify our knowledge.
			- What makes vocabulary valuable and important is not the words themselves so much as the understandings they afford. - Adams (2009, p. 180)
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670586595836_0.png)
			- ### CONNECTING VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION TO THE CLASSROOM
				- Whether we are reading or listening, words only come to life when we recognize their meaning and connections to the oral or written environment.
				- Logically, students will need to know the words within a written text to fully understand it.
				- The author conveys intended meaning through the choice of precise words and syntax; this is the surface code referenced in earlier chapters.
				- This chapter focuses on developing a deep understanding of the varied aspects of this critical contributor to comprehension.
			- ### VOCABULARY DEFINED
				- *^^Vocabulary^^ can be defined in multiple ways and from varied perspectives.*
				- Broadly, it is all ^^the words in a language used to understand and communicate thought.^^
				- More specifically, it can be thought of as ^^an individual's lexicon or mental dictionary of words that serve multiple purposes.^^
				- Differences in an individual's lexicon emerge over time, depending on experiences, with receptive vocabulary usually exceed expressive, given the supportive context of speaking and reading.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670586886052_0.png)
				- A comprehensive definition of vocabulary also addresses ^^an individual's level of understanding^^; namely, ^^breadth^^, ^^depth^^, and ^^fluency^^.
				- These differences are directly related to one's ability to use language receptively and expressively.
				- *^^Breadth^^* -^^usually refers to the size of an individual's mental lexicon.^^
				- It denotes how many words a learner recognizes or knows at a certain level (Nation, 2001).
				- ^^*Depth*^^ refers to ^^the richness of word knowledge the individual possesses about^^ know words; thus, it is the measure of how well an individual knows a word (Anderson & Freebody, 1981; Beck, McKeown, & Kucan, 2002; Stahl, 1991).
				- ^^*Fluency*^^ refers to ^^the rate at which the individual gains access to the meaning of a word^^ (Wolf, Miller, & Donnelly, 2000).
				- These levels of understanding are directly connected and reflect the nature of word learning.
				- Experts in the field have described ^^vocabulary knowledge^^ as:
				- ^^Incremental^^
				- ^^Interrelated^^
				- ^^Multidimensional^^
				- ^^Understanding the meaning of words changes over time^^, depending on multiple factors, including instruction and experience.
				- We learn ^^the meaning of words in bits and pieces.^^
				- Thus, word learning is incremental.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670587139429_0.png)
				- Although we usually recognize many words in context, we do not own all of the words we encounter.
				- Rather, the surroundings in which we find words support our understanding of word meaning.
				- Both breadth and depth contribute to the student's comprehension.
				- Depth becomes increasingly important as students engage in more challenging academic tasks, particularly those involving expression of understanding (Li & Kirby, 2014; Tannenbaum, Torgesen, & Wagner, 2006).
				- A deeper understanding, including multiple dimensions of word meaning, facilitates 'precision of meaning; facile access; the ability to articulate one's understanding; flexibility in application of knowledge of a word; the appreciation of word play; the ability to recognize; to define; to use expressively' (Calfee & Drum, 1986, pp. 825-826).
				- The term *vocabulary* can also be associated with different types of words students encounter in and out of school.
				- For example, Greene and Coxhead (2015) identified three ways to think about vocabulary.
				- They described words as being academic, technical (specific to a discipline), or high-frequency vocabulary.
				- ^^Academic language^^ is considered ^^the language of school.^^
				- ^^*Academic vocabulary*^^ is typically defined as ^^the language of texts, words that are found across disciplines; are often more nuanced or abstract; and are derived form Latin roots.^^ (eg *ject* in *project*) or Greek forms (eg, *psych* in *psychiatrist*).
				- These words are the primary instructional target because they are the 'kind of words that students must know to read increasingly demanding text with comprehension' (Hiebert & Kamil, 2005, p. 4).
				- A knowledge of the varied meanings of the word *vocabulary* is foundational for informed educators.
				- A deeper understanding is necessary for effective instruction and requires understanding not only the *what* of instruction, but also the *why.*
				-
			- ### CONNECTIONS TO READING COMPREHENSION
				- ^^Vocabulary^^, ^^the bridge between word level processes and the cognitive process of comprehension. - Hiebert and Kamil (2005, p. 4)^^
				- There is no lack of evidence for the importance of vocabulary knowledge in developing skilled reading.
				- As the reader extracts and constructs meaning, he or she maps meaning onto printed words and deciphers their relationships within the context of the sentence.
				- As such, vocabulary knowledge is a key contributor to reading comprehension and the construction of a mental model of text.
				- Understanding the meaning of most words within a text is a prerequisite to understanding that text.
				- It has been reported that adequate reading comprehension depends on a person already knowing between 90%-95% of the words in a text (Nagy & Scott, 2000).
				-
			- ### DESIGNING AND DELIVERING COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTION
				- ^^Vocabulary instruction^^ is only one contributor to comprehension.
				- Experts estimate that the average high school graduate knows or recognizes 40,000-50,000 word meanings, with acquisition occuring over a life time.
				- The literature says that students come to school knowing 4,000 - 5,000 base words (Biemiller, 2005), and they probably know 30,000 words by seventh grade (Graves, 2009).
				- ^^A four-part framework^^ that aligns with the work of any in this field fulfills this need (Graves, 2009).
				- It is a structured approach for the acquisition and application of vocabulary knowledge that includes
				- ^^Providing rich and varied language experiences^^
				- ^^Teaching individual words^^
				- ^^Teaching word learning strategies^^
				- ^^Fostering word consciousness^^
				- This framework for vocabulary instruction is directly reflected in the blueprint's questions and represented in Figure 4.4.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670588028658_0.png)
				- ^^*Intentional instruction*^^ - direct, explicit systemic teaching of targeted words
				- ^^*Incidental instruction*^^ - indirect, purposeful teaching of targeted words
				- ^^*Intentional word learning strategy instruction*^^- direct, explicit teaching of strategies for unlocking word meanings independently
				- ^^*Word conscious instruction*^^ - direct and indirect inclusion of varied activities intended to develop an interest and awareness of the importance of word meaning.
				- Most in the field agree that optimally 10-15 words per week can be taught directly and in depth.
				- For example, Beck and colleagues (2002) recommended that educators consider importance, utility, and conceptual understanding.
				- They provided a tiered framework for word choice that includes the following guidence.
				- ^^*Tier One words*^^ - common basic words used in everyday conversations that most children know; not usually the target of instruction (eg *way, thought*).
				- ^^*Tier Two words*^^ - more sophisticated words often used by mature language users in speech and writing; found across a variety of texts and domains; often the target of instruction (eg, *approach , concept*).
				- ^^*Tier Three words*^^ - words with more narrow and specific roles in language, not necessarily familiar to mature language users.
				- They are more specific to a domain or concept, are technical, and are more likely to be taught through explanation in context; they may not be the focus of intentional instruction (eg, equilateral, homeostasis).
				- ^^Resources^^ such as the following can also be helpful:
				- ^^Academic Vocabulary lists^^ (Coxhead, 2000)
				- ^^Words Worth Teaching^^ (Biemiller, 2010)
				- ^^Middle school vocabulary lists^^ (Green & Coxhead, 2015)
				- For our purposes, the focus is on using three criteria that reflect consensus in the field to guide selection.
				- Table 4.1 lists questions related to each criterion to ask when choosing which words to teach.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670588420481_0.png)
				- A simple routine for introducing targeted words for intentional instruction is described next in Table 4.3 and is followed by a more complex routine that addresses necessary practice and processing (see Table 4.4).
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670588568562_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670588577489_0.png)
				- *How the Simple Routine Connects to Instructional Principles*
				- The routine demands that the teacher develops a definition and contextual examples.
				- It is important for the teacher to express the meaning in language that students can understand.
				- Word meaning maps can support teacher preparation and student learning for different types of words including nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
				- They serve to initially introduce definitional information.
				- For example, a teacher could use a noun word meaning map, as show in Figure 4.5
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670588727705_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670588740400_0.png)
				- Note that both maps contain examples.
				- It is important to include contextual information beginning with the word's use in the text as well as examples from other scenarios, student experiences, and possibly, connections to other related words.
				- *__The Complex Routine: Connections to Instructional Principles__*
				- Students need multiple opportunities for building connections between words and experience to develop a rich understanding of word meaning.
				- Students need to learn not only definitions but also how to use words in varied contexts.
				- Structured activities provide additional interactions necessary for depth of word knowledge.
				- *Build Connections* Semantic mapping, concept maps, and semantic feature analysis are activities that help students build connections.
				- Semantic maps are a vehicle for connecting words to their relatives, such as synonyms, antonyms, examples, multiple meanings, and other related words.
				- The teacher initially models the process using online resources or print copies of a word map by following these steps.
				- 1 Identify the targeted word.
				- 2 Write the word in the center of the map and include its basic meaning.
				- Add synonyms, antonyms, and examples from text.
				- Draw or add pictures that represent meaning.
				- Online resources, including dictionaries, visuals, and templates, can support and scaffold consruction.
				- These might include [Word Hippo](http://www.wordhippo.com), [PowerUp: What-Works](http://www.powerupwhatworks.org), [Visual Thesaurus](http://www.visualthesaurus.com)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670589182488_0.png)
				- ### Creating a Structured Semantic Map
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670589240128_0.png)
				- Semantic feature analysis explores similarities and differences in related words.
				- Working with students and discussing related words and subtle differences supports deeper understanding and ultimately their choice of words to express understanding.
				- For example, possible synonyms for the word *hide*, representing various shades of meaning, could include *disguise,* *conceal,* and *bury.*
				- Students are encouraged to think about shades of meaning, discuss each, and then place words on a continuum or on a sample strip to represent nuances of meaning (see Figure 4.9).
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670589440975_0.png)
				- *Using the Words* Informed instruction includes the means for students to use their knowledge and express understanding not only in the context of the text but also beyond, which means giving them opportunities to use words orally and in writing.
				- The use of the following prompts can support oral responses:
				- Why would...
				- When have you...
				- Would you want to be...
				- Beck et al. (2002) propose structured activities that scaffold use of word meaning through questions, examples, and connections.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670589588936_0.png)
				- Teachers can use word walls to display vocabulary based on various aspects of the words.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670589648846_0.png)
				- *__An Instructional Road Map__*The infographic shown in figure 4.14 summarizes many of the components of intentional-on-purpose instruction discussed.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670589692758_0.png)
				- ### Independent Word Learning Strategies
					- ^^*__Dictionaries__*^^ ^^Different types of dictionaries are more useful when the students understand when and how to use this resource^^, including acquiring subskills necessary for using hard copy or online dictionaries.
					- ^^*__Context Clues__*^^ ^^The use of context clues is another effective word learning strategy.^^
					- Researchers believe that even a small improvement in a student's ability to use context clues has the potential to produce substantial, long-term vocabulary growth.
					- The context clue chart in Table 4.6 provides direction for identifying different types and how they support understanding of word meaning.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670589973031_0.png)
					- ^^*__Morphology__*^^ Analysis of word parts or morphemes can also be used to work with unknown vocabulary.
					- An awareness of morphemes that carry meaning (prefixes, roots, suffixes) allows students to parse words and infer word meaning.
				- ### Word Consciousness
					- ^^Word consciousness^^ is the final component of a structured approach to word learning.
					- This approach involves ^^developing an awareness of words as the building blocks of language^^ and an interest in how they work.
					- Nagy (2005) indicated that it also includes 'various aspects of words-their meanings, their histories, relationships with other words, word parts, and most important, the way writers use words effectively to communicate' (p.30).
					- Word play can be the source of meaningful and fun activities that fall into seven categories indicated in Table 4.7
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670590267839_0.png)
					- Books and games are valuable sources for capturing student interest and engaging students in meaning:
					- *Donavan's Word Jar* (DeGloss, 1994)
					- *Frindle* (Clements, 1996)
					- *The Word Collector* (Reynolds, 2018)
					- Others that are more specific to world play include
					- *The King Who Rained* (Gwynne, 1970)
					- *Pun and Games (Lederer, 1996)*
					- *The Great Dictionary Caper* (Comstock, 2018)
				- ### Assessing Students' Word Knowledge: Classroom-Based Assessment
					- The literature provides some guidance in this area, suggesting the inclusion of a student tasks that align with the instructional principles discussed earlier in this chpater:
					- ^^*Definition*^^ - write a definition.
					- ^^*Context*^^ - identify meaning within context.
					- ^^*Semantic network*^^ - express knowledge of related words (Pearson, Hiebert, & Kamil, 2012).
					- We collaborated to develop a chart of classroom-based assessments that I continue to refine (see Table 4.9)

		- ## CHAPTER 5: The Blueprint for Syntax and Sentence Comprehension
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670650396768_0.png)
			- ### CONNECTING SENTENCE COMPREHENSION TO THE CLASSROOM
				- Making meaning of text requires not only understanding individual words but also comprehending sentences.
			- ### SYNTAX AND SENTENCE COMPREHENSION
				- ^^Syntax^^ provides t^^he system that is responsible for and 'directs the production and comprehension of sentences'^^ (Soifer, 2019, p. 102).
				- It has been described in varied ways, including:
				- ^^How words combine into phrases, clauses, and sentences^^
				- ^^The internal structure of a sentence^^
				- The way in which word order assists the transfer of meaning from one mind to another
				- The basic rules for comprehension of sentences
				- ^^The arrangement of words into sentences and phrases^^, which is a major component of grammar
				- Although not synonymous with grammar (rules for oral and written production of language), syntax is closely related in that they work in concert with each other.
			- ### CONNECTIONS TO READING COMPREHENSION
				- ^^Syntax places the word within the structure necessary to fully communicate its meaning.^^
				- Understanding that syntactic structure substantially contributes to students' comprehension of written text (Zipoli, 2016).
				- This includes knowledge of language structures or systems, syntax and semantics, and the interconnected processes and skills that directly contribute to making meaning of sentences and ultimately, the text.
				- When skilled readers come to text, they recognize and retrieve the meaning of individual words and also 'work out the syntactic structure and sense of the sentence' (Cain & Oakhill, 2007, p. xii).
				- This critical level of language processing and the characteristics of sentences encountered in academic texts is represented in Figure 5.2.
				- A knowledge of the sentences, including its definition structures, and inherent challenges is necessary for designing and delivering informed instruction for all students.
				- Educators cannot teach what they do not know or understand.
				- Effective instruction is not only about the what but also the why.
				- The informed educator understands the rules of grammar.
				- ### Sentences Defined
				- ^^The sentences^^ has been traditionally ^^defined as a complete thought.^^
				- But there are varied ways to describe the sentence depending on purpose and perspective. For example:
				- ^^*Grammatically:*^^ ^^'A set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses.^^ [Oxford Dic](https://www.oxforddictionaries.com)
				- ^^*Linguistically:*^^ ^^'An abstract linguistic frame that has slots for categories of words and phrases' (Moats & Hennessy, 2011, p. 43).^^
				- ^^*Structurally:*^^ ^^Sentences are often identified based on their structure (e.g., simple, compound, complex, compound-complex), which is related to the number and type of clauses (dependent and independent).^^
				- ### The Building Blocks of Sentences
				- '^^The sentence^^ is ^^the unit of language strategically positioned between individual words and text.' -Eberhardt (2013, p. 43)^^
				- ^^In combination, words, phrases, and clauses make up the content of sentences, paragraphs, and overall text.^^
				- The following sections examine these sentence building blocks - words, phrases, and clauses.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670651315765_0.png)
					- ^^*__The Words__*^^ What exactly is the job of individual words or parts of speech in the sentence?
					- A word's part of speech is ^^a clue to meaning, and, in fact, each part of speech has a very specific role within the sentence.^^
					- Each part of speech has a very specific job, and consequently, provides answers to meaning-related questions. (See Table 5.1).
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670651397103_0.png)
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670651403732_0.png)
					- ^^*__Phrases and Clauses__*^^ Obviously, words alone do not constitute a sentence.
					- They are ^^combined into phrases and clauses to construct varied types of sentences.^^
					- What is the difference between a phrase and a clause?
					- ^^*Phrases*^^ -^^A phrase is a group of words that work together but do not constitute a sentence by themselves.^^
					- Sentence-attuned educators are also familiar with other types of phrases that further describe or elaborate on the subject or predicate in sentences, including prepositional, adjectival, or adverbial phrases.
					- All play a role in constructing meaning.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670651635236_0.png)
					- ^^*Clauses*^^ A clause is^^a group or cluster of words that work together and contain both a *who*or *what*(subject) and an *is/was doing* (predicate).^^
					- Clauses fall into two categories^^-independent^^ and ^^dependent^^ (see Table 5.3).
					- As its name denotes, ^^an independent clause^^ ^^stands on its own and constitutes a simple or kernel sentence.^^
					- Independent clauses are ^^joined to make a compound sentence.^^
					- ^^Coordinating conjugations^^ (commonly called *the ^^FANBOYS^^ - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so*) serve to connect the clauses.
					- Those ^^clauses that do not stand alone are obviously^^  ^^dependent.^^
					- They ^^contain subject and predicate but are subordinate to the independent clause and typically begin with a subordinating conjunction^^ (eg, because, when although) or a relative pronoun (eg that, which, who).
					- ^^Dependent clauses^^ can be found ^^at the beginning or end of the sentence or embedded within it and, in combination with an independent clause, comprise a complex sentence.^^
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670652057342_0.png)
					- *__Simple, Compound, and Complex Sentences__*
					- The structure of each sentence is key to understanding meaning (see Table 5.4)
					- Basically, ^^a simple sentence^^ is ^^an independent clause, and its role is to convey one idea unit.^^
					- A ^^compound sentence^^  ^^represents two ideas independent of each other that are related in some way.^^
					- A^^complex sentence^^  ^^is constructed of at least one dependent clause and independent clause.^^
					- Finally, ^^a compound-complex sentence^^ ^^consists of two independent clauses and one dependent clause.^^
					- Given the challenges of academic language, a basic understanding of sentence structure is necessary for working with the complex sentences found in academic text.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670652204060_0.png)
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670652210507_0.png)
					- ^^*__The Text__*^^ Comprehension is an integrative process during which ^^information from different sentences is combined.^^
					- Regardless of whether the text is narrative or informational, the reader needs not only to make meaning of the individual sentences but also determine how those sentences cohere or, in combination, make sense.
					- The reader constructs a coherent representation of text based on ^^the words and syntax used by the author^^ (^^surface code^^) and the ^^cohesive devices^^ ^^(cohesive ties and connectives) that bridge ideas within and between sentences.^^
					- Although this requires an understanding of syntax and sentence structures, it also calls for the reader to make an inference.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670662740781_0.png)
					- **Problematic Sentence Construction**
					- If a reader cannot derive meaning from individual sentences that make up a text, that is going to be a major obstacle in text-level comprehension. - Scott (2009, p. 184)
					- Students must be able to work through the complexities and challenges of academic texts to construct the meaning of multiple idea units and grasp logical relationships conveyed in varied sentences.
					- Even a simple sentence is not so simple when subjects and predicates are compounded and phrases embedded or when compound sentences suddenly morph into compound-complex sentences.
					- Even skilled readers sometimes struggle with the more ^^complicated syntactical structures^^ found in academic texts.
					- These are found in various texts but are more characteristic of expository or informational selections.
					- Which structures or features make these sentences more difficult to understand?
					- They are often longer and contain a larger number of embedded noun phrases as premodifiers, relative clauses as postmodifiers, and multiple clauses that are dependent on one another.
					- Embedding creates distances between the subject and the predicate, making it more difficult for the student to identify key idea units.
					- In addition, sentences in academic texts frequently contain a higher proportion of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), thus increasing density of information and number of propositions.
					- Passive sentences, such as *The dog was fed by the woman*, are another stumbling block for students.
					- The typical order is reversed, with the object of the verb preceding the subject, causing confusion for the reader. (Scott & Balthazar, 2013).
					- All of these-^^length^^, ^^dependency,^^ ^^density,^^ and ^^word order^^-are potential troublemakers (see Figure 5.6)
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670663257019_0.png)
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670663320426_0.png)
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670663332050_0.png)
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670663343106_0.png)
					- When educators are aware of those conditions that make it difficult for students to discern the main clause or idea units, they are able to anticipate and plan accordingly based on students' needs (Scott, 2004).
					- The next section addresses strategies and activities for working with sentence constructions, from basic to more challenging.
					-
			- ### DESIGNING AND DELIVERING COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTION
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670663500324_0.png)
				- ### Questioning
				- Questioning is widely recognized as an effective strategy for supporting reading comprehension for all students (Carnine, Silbert, Kame'enui, & Tarver, 2010).
				- *__Grammar-Based Deconstruction Activities__* Comprehending a sentence begins with understanding how individual words function within the sentence and contribute to its meaning.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670663666931_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670663682657_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670663801825_0.png)
				- Activities that focus on deconstruction and incorporate questioning are effective for working with later developing students' understanding of clauses and complex sentences.
				- These structures include relative and adverbial clauses and object complements and are often problematic for students.
				- For example, a relative clause acts as an adjective by providing information about the subject or object of an independent clause (Justice & Ezell, 2008).
				- It is usually embedded after the noun it describes and begins with a relative pronoun (eg who, whose, that).
				- Students often encounter relative clauses in narrative and expository text during late elementary, middle, and high school years.
				- *__Sentence-Based Activities__* Sentence-based activities such as sentence combining and sentence expansion are commonly used in writing instruction, but teachers can also use these activities to support reading comprehension.
				- *The Writing Connection: Sentence Combining* Sentence combining is an effective strategy for sentence writing that also has value for sentence comprehension.
				- Sentence combining typically requires students to combine a kernel sentence with another using varied syntactic patterns.
				- These combinations are based on a logical sequence of patterns such as the one described in 5.7.
				- Teachers provide text-based questions and sentences they have culled or created from student work for the activity.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670664159779_0.png)
				- *The Writing Connection: Sentence Expansion* Sentence expansion also builds sentence competency through writing while supporting understanding.
				- It provides an opportunity for students to use varied sentence structures to move beyond basic responses to text-related prompts.
				- A kernel or simple sentence, coupled with questions (eg what, when, where, how, why), primes the pump for students to elaborate either orally or through written responses.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670664248001_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670664290753_0.png)
				- Passive sentences reverse the typical order (subject-verb-object) of sentences, which can be very challenging for many students. For example:
				- Passive construction: *The almanac was written by Benjamin Banneker.*
				- Active construction: *Benjamin Banneker wrote an almanac.*
				- *__Diagramming Sentences__*
				- Although diagramming has all but vanished form the educational scene, it is worth a revisit related to comprehending sentences-but only if it is viewed as more than a mechanical or even fun exercise; rather, it should be recognized as a visual representation of language.
				- By ^^simply using lines^^, ^^the diagram^^ ^^provides the slots into which words fit and communicate the relationship among these words.^^
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670664540482_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670664552400_0.png)
				- Diagramming obviously requires a basic knowledge of sentence structure and the function of parts of speech and phrases.
				- Diagramming can be a meaningful warm-up or follow-up activity when accompanied by a discussion of how language is used to convey meaning.

				-
			- ### SUMMARY: HELPING STUDENTS CONSTRCUT MEANING AT THE SENTENCE LEVEL
				- Constructing a coherent mental representation of text depends on multiple levels of language and cognitive process.
				- This chapter focused on viewing syntax as a vehicle for conveying meaning.
				- The building blocks of meaning (parts of speech, phrases, clauses, and sentence structures) are defined from the perspective of their function and their contribution to reading comprehension.
				-
		- ## CHAPTER 6: The Blueprint for Text Structures
		  collapsed:: true
			- 'Readers who are familiar with the particular structure of the text have several advantages: they know what to expect form different parts of the text, where to search for particular types of information and how the different parts of the text are linked together.' -Oakhill, Cain, and Elbro (2015, p. 82)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670664968471_0.png)
			- As a proficient reader, you consistently gain access to and connect what you know with information presented in print.
			- ### CONNECTING TO THE CLASSROOM
				- Constructing one's intended meaning in print requires choosing precise words, sentence types, and, ultimately, a text structure that conveys the author's purpose.
				- Teaching students about these varied structures supports their ability to focus on key information and ultimately support their comprehension of content.
				- There are variations, however, within each general category, depending on the genre the author has chosen.
				- Informed comprehension instruction calls for educators to have a deeper knowledge beyond text types, such as why authors choose specific formats, the features of each text structure, how they support the making of meaning, and effective instructional approaches.
			- ### LITERACY KNOWLEDGE AND TEXT STRUCTURES
				- Their knowledge base initially encompasses the understanding that print conveys meaning and it is formatted in specific ways to support reading and writing.
				- A brief review of connections between comprehension and a knowledge of narrative and informational text provides teachers with a foundation for understanding the role of text structure or literacy knowledge in reading comprehension.
			- ### CONNECTIONS TO READING COMPREHENSION
				- Skilled reading depends on multiple language and cognitive processes.
				- Proficient readers have a more complete knowledge of how stories and informational text are structured, and they use it in concert with other language processes and skills to construct meaning.
				- As the reader works with the meaning of the words and  sentences found in the text (microstructure), he or she is also grappling with the connected sentence and paragraphs and underlying meanings (macrostructure) that convey essential understandings of the text.
				- The ability to recognize and use the structural features of text is a critical text processing skill.
				- A knowledge of these patterns allows the reader to anticipate how information will be presented and to search for, remember, organize, and process information more strategically and efficiently.
				- For example, a student who is reading a narrative text knows it will include characters, initiating events, a problem or conflict, and so forth.
				- This awareness helps the student identify critical ideas and their relationships to overall meaning.
				- When you read a novel, you need few, if any, reminders to pay attention to the characters' actions and reactions.
				- Similarly, a reader's knowledge of expository text structure helps him or her organize information and complex patterns found in content area texts (Pyle et al., 2017).
			- ### UNDERSTANDING TEXT STRUCTURES
				- ^^Narrative text^^ ^^typically tells a story; narrative may be fiction or nonfiction.^^
				- ^^Informational text^^ ^^informs or instructs readers about a topic; this category includes many forms of nonfiction writing^^
				- ### Narrative Text: Purpose and Story Elements
				- Narrative text is initially more familiar to students because their early exposure to narration through watching television programs and movies and listening to children's literature and the conversations surrounding them (Williams & Pao, 2011).
				- ^^Narratives^^ ^^portray a story, or sequence of related events-fictional or sometimes nonfictional.^^
				- ^^Their primary purpose^^ is ^^to entertain while providing an account of a problem or conflict with a series of events leading to a resolution.^^
				- These ^^events are sequenced temporally or causally and occur in specific settings described by the narrator;^^ ^^events are also described through the portrayal of the characters and their interactions with one another.^^
				- ^^The primary elements of a story^^ are ^^represented through story grammar, a set of rules that serve to organize the important elements of a story into logical structure (Dymock, 2005), which provides the schema necessary for the reader to work through the text (eg setting, characters, problem, initiating event, responses, climax, resolution).^^
				- ^^Stories typically have a^^ ^^beginning, middle, and end, and they contain signal words related to this structure (eg once upon a time, after a while, finally)^^
				- Additional features may include chapter titles (eg chapter books) and dialogue
				- While building students' understanding of basic aspects of narrative text (see Figure 6.2), informed educators need to be aware of the nuances or differences in various forms and be prepared to address them instructionally.
				- ### Informational Text: Purpose and Structures
				- ^^Expository text^^ ^^requires students to move beyond the familiar story structure and work with less familiar ad more complex structures.^^
				- The ^^specialized vocabulary^^, ^^density of details,^^ ^^unfamiliarity of content,^^ and^^less explicit organization^^  of this text type often present challenges for the reader (Mesmer, Cunningham & Heibert, 2012).
				- The^^primary purpose of informational and expository text^^  is to ^^inform or instruct by describing, persuading, explaining, or reporting.^^
				- Duke and Bennett-Armistead (2003) stated that this text type 'conveys information about the natural or social world' (p. 17).
				- Meyer (1985) analyzed and identified ^^the main expository (informational ) text structures,^^ including:
				- ^^Compare and contrast (comparison)^^
				- ^^Problem and solution^^
				- ^^Cause and effect (causation)^^
				- ^^Sequence (chronology)^^
				- ^^Description (Categorization, generalization)^^
				- Each ^^text structure^^ type represents a distinct ^^organizational scheme^^ and ^^purpose.^^
				- Yet, all are typically written in paragraph form (main idea and supporting details) and contain associated signal words that align with the text's purpose (eg, description: *such as;* sequence: *before;* comparison: *similar to;* cause and effect: *because*).
				- Figure 6.3 represents the basic aspects of informational text.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670740990275_0.png)
				- Skill in utilizing informational text is critical to achievement in school and beyond.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670741082242_0.png)
				-
			- ### DESIGNING AND DELIVERING COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTION
				- Knowledge of story grammar supports the analysis of text and facilitates what these readers understand and remember about the story (Goldman & Rakestraw, 2000).
				- ### Crafting Informed, Explicit Instruction
				- Understanding how to use text structures to improve comprehension necessitates explicit instruction.
				- Although student experiences with high-quality texts are important, they are not always sufficient to ensure that they develop this critical comprehension processing skill.
				- Instruction should initially focus on the basics, including purpose, structure, and features, as well as related signal words.
				- It is essential for teachers to deliver explicit instruction, including direct explanations and modeling, practice with focused feedback, and opportunities for application.
				- In addition, the informed educator needs to attend to the following effective practices and include them when appropriate:
				- *Use of exemplar texts* - initially choosing texts that clearly contain the features of each text type and, when necessary, adapting texts to student skill level, then moving to more complex texts (Meyer & Ray, 2011)
				- *Use of visual representations* - using visual cues and graphic organizers to scaffold organization of information found in narrative or informational texts.
				- *Use of text structure strategies*- applying strategies that highlight various patterns used in narrative or informational text to communicate purpose.
				- *Attention to signal devices* - understanding how words and phrases cue relationships between ideas and how text features support understanding of the organization of text.
				- *Planning for effective teacher and student questioning* - incorporating focused questioning before, during, and after instruction to surface, build, and apply knowledge of text structures; teaching students to monitor their own comprehension using these questions.
				- ### Teaching Narrative Text
				- When teaching narrative text, the following strategies can be useful for explicit instruction: teaching story structure and elements, using visual representations, teaching how signal words are used, and including focused questioning as part of instruction
				- Each strategy is described next.
				- *__Teach Story Structure and Elements__* Students initially need to be directly taught the purpose of a narrative and the basic elements of story grammar.
				- ^^Story structure^^ or grammar typically includes ^^elements related to a a problem that the main character encounters and attempts to resolve.^^
				- The ^^characters attempts or actions, which focus on solving the problem,^^ make up the ^^main story structure.^^
				- The ^^primary purpose of a narrative^^ has been identified, and now the ^^role of each element^^ is discussed (see Table 6.2).
				- Table 6.2 ![image.png](../assets/image_1670741738322_0.png)
				- ^^Elements^^ in ^^narrative text generally follow a logical sequence.^^
				- The author introduces the characters, the setting, and the conflict (or events that will soon lead to a problem or conflict).
				- The ^^middle of the story^^ ^^focuses on rising action^^ (events developing the problem/conflict and leading toward the solution), ^^climax^^, and ^^falling action^^ (events caused by the climax), ^^with the end leading to the resolution or outcome^^.
				- Informed educators adapt language, visual cues, objects, or gestures, depending on the student's grade and skill level.
				- Teaching tools, such as the [Story Grammar Marker](https://mindwingconcepts.com/) may be used to support the understanding of younger students.
				- ^^Story gloves^^ can be used effectively in the lower grades with students (Newman, 2002).
				- The glove has ^^pictures or symbols on each finger that represent the elements of a story^^ (see Figure 6.4).
				- On the glove shown in Figure 6.4, ^^a face represents characters^^; ^^a clock and tree - the setting^^; ^^stairs going up and down - events^^; ^^the question mark - the problem^^; ^^and a light bulb - the outcome.^^
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670742754361_0.png)
				- More advanced or differentiated versions of the glove have words instead of symbols written on each finger (eg, character, setting, problem, rising and falling action, climax, resolution).
				- As students work with high-quality text and move through the grades, educators will need to directly teach them about ^^other literary elements^^ such as ^^theme^^ (lessons learned), ^^point of view^^ (who is telling the story), ^^symbolism^^ (representing ideas, relationships), ^^foreshadowing^^ (advance hints), ^^metaphors^^, ^^alliteration^^, ^^hyperbole^^, and ^^imagery.^^
				- *__Use Visual Representations__* Visual representations can be used not only to introduce the basic elements but also to help students practice and process understanding.
				- The teacher explicitly teaches the *why, what, when, and where* of using story maps, frames, and storyboards.
				- Students practice and receive focused feedback when necessary.
				- Graphic organizers represent ideas and their relationships between them visually and graphically.
				- ^^Story maps^^ are a type of ^^graphic organizer that can be used to teach the elements and features of narrative text.^^
				- They may be basic or more advanced, depending on students' needs.
				- For example, a basic representation might focus on a feature of narrative text (ie, stories have a beginning, middle, and end)(see figure 6.5) and ask students to create  visual and provide an oral or written summary in a few words.
				- Simple maps may also focus on basic story elements, including character, setting, problem, events, and outcomes (see Figure 6.6).
				- Maps eventually become more complex as students break down these elements further (eg, consequences) and explore other features such as ^^character traits^^, ^^motives^^, or use of ^^literary devices^^.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670743108136_0.png)
				- ^^Storyboards^^ are another type of ^^visual representation and consist of drawings that are similar to a cartoon strip and represent the sequence of events within a story.^^
				- Students are typically given a template that resembles a blank comic strip.
				- ^^A basic storyboard has five to six frames^^, each representing various elements of the story (see Figure 6.7).
				- For example, the first frame might introduce the character and setting, with successive frames illustrating the problem, actions, climax, and solution.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670743194920_0.png)
				- ^^Story frames^^ are also ^^graphic representations of text that can be sued to support student understanding of how the content of the story fits into a narrative structure.^^
				- Basic forms ask students to provide information about the events of the story. For example:
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670743242367_0.png)
				- A more advanced version might call for additional information about the problem, nature of events, and circumstances surrounding them.
				- *__Teach Signal Words__* ^^Signal words or phrases^^ provide the reader with ^^cues that support understanding of the structure and relationship between the parts of a narrative text (see Table 6.3).^^
				- These devices assist the reader in connecting and constructing ideas to build a coherent representation of the text.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670743354120_0.png)
				- These signals should be taught explicitly using exemplar texts and current reading selections.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670743413058_0.png)
				- *__Use Questioning__* Questioning has been identified as a meaningful comprehension strategy.
				- Teacher-generated questions used as prompts in combination with other strategies, including graphic organizers, support students in extracting and constructing meaning.
				- Questions also stand alone to guide reading, support retell or summarization, and, ultimately, to check comprehension.
				- Purposeful questions tap into the reader's understanding of how the varied elements contribute to the comprehension of the text (see Table 6.4).
				- Consider the examples in the table of questions at a basic and more advanced level.
				- These questions can be asked during or after reading and can be adapted based on the text itself.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670743582345_0.png)

				- ### Teaching Informational Texts
				- Without an adequate understanding of the structures inherent in expository text and the strategies needed to comprehend the text that is organized within these structures, many students struggle with their rather sudden shift to informational texts. - Duke (2000, p.20)
				- The following strategies can be useful for explicit instruction when teaching informational text: teaching expository paragraph structure as the foundation for students' understanding, teaching common informational or expository text structures and elements, teaching how signaling devices (including text features) are used within informational text, teaching comprehension strategies that are specific to various structures, using graphic organizers, and including questioning as part of instruction.
				- ^^*__Teach Paragraph Structure__*^^ Proficient students recognize and are able to work with a range of informational or expository text structures.
				- K^^nowing whether an author is^^ ^^describing^^, ^^comparing,^^ ^^linking causes and effects^^ or ^^problems and solutions^^, or ^^sequencing steps or events^^ is critical to the construction of meaning.
				- The structure conveys purpose and allows the reader to focus attention on the essential ideas and concepts.
				- But comprehending varied informational text structures begins with an understanding of basic paragraph structures.
				- *^^Basic Paragraph Structure^^* Basic paragraph structure provides ^^the foundation for working with informational text structures.^^
				- A basic paragraph typically consists of ^^a topic sentence that conveys the main idea,^^ ^^supporting sentences that supply details^^, and ^^a closing or concluding sentence.^^
				- Generally, the topic sentence begins the paragraph; however, there are variations.
				- For example, the main idea may be found after the details or even at the end of the paragraph.
				- In some instances, it may not be stated explicitly and requires the reader to infer the topic.
				- Although we often relate understanding paragraph structures to writing instruction, this understanding is also essential to comprehend informational text.
				- ^^RAP^^ is a ^^common paraphrasing strategy that taps into how a paragraph conveys meaning in print^^ (Schumacher, Denton, & Deshler, 1984) and is effective for all students, including those potentially at risk for reading difficulties (Hagaman, Casey, & Reid, 2010).
				- It consists of three steps that are directly taught to students with the expectation that they will question and implement the strategy as they read.
				- ^^1 - Read a paragraph.^^
				- ^^2 - Ask yourself about the main idea and details in this paragraph.^^
				- ^^3 - Put the main idea and details in your own words.^^
				- *How Purpose Determines Text Structure* Of course, we want our students to also understand the nature of specific informational text structures that are used to inform and convey different ideas.
				- The teacher introduces and explicitly teaches different text structures one by one, that is, the purpose of and differences between description, chronological sequence, compare and contrast, problem and solution, and cause and effect paragraphs.
				- Next, the teacher teaches signal words and introduces graphic organizers that represent patterns.
				- The teacher also provides students with multiple opportunities to analyze and identify specific text types.
				- Students eventually learn to apply this knowledge to texts using multiple structures whether within a single selection or a textbook chapter.
				- Table 6.5 provides basic information related to the purpose and differences between these text types.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670744460480_0.png)
				- The literature indicates that descriptive and sequence structures are easier than the remaining three and, consequently, are often introduced first.
				- Students will encounter informational texts that may be considered mixed texts (Alexander & Jetton, 2000) and can include historical or scientific readings that are quasi-narrative in form and at the same time informational.
				- They are usually classified as narrative or informational based on which elements are most common throughout the text.
				- ### Check Your Understanding
				- Identify the text type using the questions provided in the chart.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670744636559_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670744644479_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670744664995_0.png)
				- ### Signaling Devices: Signal Words and Text Features
				- Explicit signals of important relationships within and among paragraphs in expository texts provide efficient processing instructions for readers with strategic knowledge about text structures.' - Meyer, Wijkumar, and Lei (2018, p. 1937)
				- Signaling devices include signal words and text features.
				- ^^Signal words^^ are found within informational paragraphs and ^^cue the reader to text types and their purpose.^^
				- ^^Text features^^, such as ^^title^^, ^^headings^^, and ^^diagrams,^^ also f^^ocus student attention on the text supporting understanding of organization and content of the text.^^
				- ^^*Signal words*^^ - Similar to their role in narrative text, ^^signal words or phrases in informational or expository text play a critical role in identifying and understanding different text types^^ (see Table 6.6).
				- The informed educator recognizes the importance of directly explaining the role of these words.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670744862096_0.png)
				- ^^*Text features*^^ - As students move through the grades, they encounter^^informational selections^^  of increasing length and complexity and are expected to understand disciplinary texts.
				- In addition to working with varied information structures, the skilled reader knows how to identify and use the text features typically found in these readings.
				- Although there is some overlap with narrative texts (eg, chapter titles, glossaries), these features are primarily characteristic of information or expository text.
				- Table 6.7 includes basic elements that should be explicitly taught.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670744985713_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670745057022_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670745069295_0.png)
				- *__Use the Text Structure Strategy__* The text structure strategy has developed over time and is one potential approach for teaching structure.
				- The effectiveness of directly teaching text structures has been well established, beginning with the research conducted by Meyer and her colleagues (1975; 2010).
				- The student uses signal words to determine the basic structure of a text (eg comparison/contrast, cause/effect, problem/solution, sequence, description).
				- The student writes a main idea sentence.
				- This sentence sums up the text with attention to its structure.
				- The student writes several additional sentences recalling important ideas in the text, incorporating signal words where appropriate (eg, due to, because, as a result).
				- The student rereads the sentences and adds details as needed.
				- Additional guidance and instruction can be found a the Reading Rockets website: [https://www.readingrockets.org/article/implementing-text-structure-strategy-your-classroom](https://www.readingrockets.org/article/implementing-text-structure-strategy-your-classroom)
				- *__Use Graphic Organizers__* Proficient readers use visual representations such as graphic organizers to organize, see relationships, and recall important information.
				- Graphic organizers are powerful instructional tools for all students, including students who are at risk and struggling readers across grade levels (Kim, Vaughn, Wanzek, & Wei, 2004).
				- Although graphic organizers may be used before, during, and after teaching a text, explicit instruction in their use is critical.
				- After introducing and explaining use of specific organizers with students (denton, Vaughn, Wexler, Bryan, & Reed, 2012). These steps can be modified based on the grade and skill level of the student.
				- Before reading:
				- Display and review the organizer and connection to structure.
				- Discuss and make connections to students' prior knowledge.
				- Use the graphic organizer as a tool to preview the structure of the text.
				- During reading:
				- Have students fill in important ideas and information as they read the text.
				- Discuss contents of the organizers.
				- After reading:
				- Have students discuss content of organizers with a partner.
				- Retell or write a summary of the text using the graphic organizer as a guide.
				- Educators can choose from multiple sources and/or create their own.
				- See Figures 6.9-6.13 for a few basic examples; not each organizer's alignment with the purpose of the text.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670745814008_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670745820735_0.png)

				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670745843662_0.png)
				- A sample completed flowchart organizing the ideas in this passage is shown in Figure 6.14.
				- These organizers represent basic structures, but as texts increase in complexity, graphic organizers also adapt to specific features of a  discipline.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1670745901329_0.png)
				- *__Use Questioning__*
				- The National Reading Panel identified question answering with teacher feedback and question asking as important strategies that may be best used as part of a multiple strategy package where the teacher uses questions to guide and monitor readers' comprehension.'
				- The increased knowledge of text structures may lead teachers to ask relevant questions about what students are reading (Gersten, Fuchs, Williams, & Baker, 2001).
				- A knowledge of organization guides the reader's thinking about the content.
				- Table 6.8 lists basic questions that teachers might ask or prompt students to ask themselves about the text.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671005774008_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671005783009_0.png)
				- *__Teaching Informational Text: A Quick Review__*
				- An educator's delivery of effective instruction depends on his or her knowledge and experience.
				- Figure 6.15 is a graphic summary of foundational components of instruction.
				- It provides a framework for educators as they consider the questions raised in the blueprint to design and deliver informed instruction.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671005877762_0.png)
				-
		- ## CHAPTER 7: The Blueprint for Background Knowledge
		  collapsed:: true
			- Prior knowledge about the topic at hand is like mental velcro.
			- The relevant knowledge gives the words of the text places to stick and make sense, thereby supporting comprehension and propelling the reading process forward.'
			- ### CONNECTING BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE TO THE CLASSROOM
				- In addition to grappling with the meaning of the words and sentences carefully crafted by an author, students need the necessary knowledge base for working with the meaning of particular texts.
				- This includes understanding the underlying meaning, what the author implied, and the larger or overall message of the text.
			- ### A PERSPECTIVE ON KNOWLEDGE
				- The term knowledge raises varied questions related to the contributions of knowledge to learning, the clarity of terms used to discuss knowledge, and its connections to instruction and student performance.
				- Cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham (2006) described how knowledge contributes to learning.
				- He related that knowledge can enhance a person's ability to:
				- Acquire new knowledge through inference making
				- Remember new information more easily when it can be related to a network of information already present in memory
				- Use previously acquired knowledge to solve problems using an expert, rather than a novice, perspective.
				- ### The Difference Between Prior and Background Knowledge
				- Although the terms *prior knowledge* and *background knowledge* are often used interchangeably, they do differ in subtle ways.
				- ^^*Prior knowledge*^^ has been ^^defined broadly within education as the knowledge, skills, or abilities the student brings to the learning process.^^
				- It is basically ^^a general collection of facts, concepts, and experiences.^^
				- Acquisition of this knowledge begins early, based on varied personal, academic, and cultural encounters.
				- Depending on these experiences, individuals connect bits of information to build a fund of knowledge and a foundation for future learning.
				- This foundation is essential for learning and purposefully developing a breadth and depth of background knowledge.
				- Background knowledge differs from prior knowledge in that it is specific to the situations, problems, and concepts presented in targeted texts used in an academic setting.
				- It has been referred to as 'concepts, experiences, information, and text structures that are relevant to a text under study' (Brody, 2001, p.241).
				- This topical knowledge has also been described as 'the key to comprehension' (Willingham, cited in Jacobsen, 2018).
				- ### Perspective on Curriculum Knowledge Gaps
				- Although knowledge is essential to learning and comprehension, many experts in the educational field have expressed unease about a lack of attention and interest in the classroom.
				- Hirsch reaffirmed his concerns about social inequities created by the knowledge gap.
				- He has consistently been committed to all students having access to ^^'the knowledge commonly possessed by successful citizens'^^ (Hirsch, 2016, p.2).
				- In Hirsch's view, this knowledge includes a clear set of ^^key concepts, facts, disciplinary principles, and cultural touchstones related to literature, the arts, science, math, history, social studies, and civics.^^
				- Neumann has consistently expressed concern about the effects of poverty on young children and their access to resources and experiences that build background knowledge.
				-
			- ### CONNECTIONS TO READING COMPREHENSION
				- A writer must always rely on the reader's knowledge to some degree.
				- There is no ^^text comprehension^^ that does not require the reader to apply: lexical, syntactic, semantic knowledge, domain knowledge, personal experience, and so on' - Kintsch (1998, p. 313)
				- A student's background knowledge works in concert with vocabulary, sentence comprehension (language structures), and literacy knowledge (text structures) to directly contribute to his or her construction of a coherent representation of complex texts.
				- Constructing meaning demands interaction among the reader, text, and task.
				- The readers' ability to tap into multiple language and cognitive processes, coupled with the demands of the text, directly influence the creation of cohesive representation of meaning (see Figures 7.3 and 7.4).
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671006743547_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671006755018_0.png)
				- The reader works with the author's exact words and sentences (surface code) and the textbase (implied meanings) while simultaneously surfacing background knowledge to make meaning of the text.
				- The student engages in multiple cognitive processes--extracting meaning units, integrating ideas, monitoring understanding, elaborating on understanding--which results in the student reader constructing a mental model of the text.
				- The building of a mental representation occurs across word, sentence, paragraph, and text and includes processes such as word identification, parsing of word strings into constituents, referential mapping of meaning, and a variety of inference process, all of which  interact with the reader's general/background knowledge and language skills. (2014, p.64)
				- Background knowledge is acquired through listening to and reading related texts.
				- More mature readers typically acquire knowledge specific to the text through reading.
				-
			- ### DESIGNING AND DELIVERING COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTION
				- Several considerations are important for educators who are thinking about how to design and deliver effective instruction in this area.
				- ### General Perspective
				- Literacy experts suggested three ways educators could focus on knowledge more seriously (Jacobsen, 2018).
				- *1. What kids read matters.*
				- Different texts have different purposes.
				- Tim Shanahan and others (2010) advocated for reading rich texts, including classical literature, and they advocated for an increased emphasis on content learning.
				- *2. Kids should learn what they read.*
				- Shanahan (2017) supported a double outcome for reading-the development of not only critical reading skills but also increased knowledge.
				- *3. Kids should review and revisit content.*
				- Reviewing and revisiting content not only emphasizes its importance but also serves to deepen students' understanding.
				- ### The Blueprint
				- At the ^^word level^^, the reader must decode individual words...and access meaning of the words they hear or read.
				- At the ^^sentence level,^^ the comprehender needs to work out the syntactic structure and sense of each sentence.
				- Simply deriving meaning of individual words and sentences is insufficient.
				- In order to construct a mental model of the text, the comprehender needs to integrate information from different sentences to established ^^local coherence^^ and to incorporate background knowledge and ideas (retrieved from ^^long term memory^^) to make sense of details that are only implicitly mentioned. - Cain and Oakhill (2007, p. xii)
				- The blueprint directly addresses the development of these critical contributors to comprehension.
				- The blueprint is based on the language comprehension strands of Scarborough's (2001) Reading Rope.
				- In addition, Cain and Oakhill's (2007) description of these essential language processes has informed our understanding of what is necessary for the reader to comprehend text, including the reader's ability to make meaning of words, sentences, and the implied meaning of text by using background knowledge.
				- The blueprint directly addresses the development of these critical contributors to comprehension.
				- The blueprint is used as a framework for preparing and delivering instruction focused on developing these critical processes and skills.
				- It provides direction for identifying critical topics and understandings, choosing purposeful texts, and identifying the author's purpose.
				- The blueprint also supports choosing effective instructional approaches and activities for vocabulary, sentence comprehension, and text structure instruction.
				- Think about how this framework reminds us to question *what, how, and when* we activate, assess, and build our students' knowledge base.
				- ### A Targeted Instructional Approach
				- The blueprint prompts educators to identify instructional opportunities and tools that focus on the ABCs of background knowledge-activate and assess, build, and connect (see Figure 7.1).
				- Asa students acquire vocabulary, they tap into existing knowledge networks and simultaneously build connections.
				- Their depth of vocabulary knowledge often reflects their understanding of related concepts. In addition, reading itself is important.
				- Marzano indicated: It is important to keep in mind that a primary source of vocabulary and, subsequently, knowledge development is wide reading.
				- Interaction with varied texts initially through read alouds and then independent reading can be a rich source of background knowledge. (2004, p.62)
				- The focus will be on intentional instruction that purposefully incorporates strategies and activities designed to activate, build, and integrate knowledge.
				- The informed educator thinks about the following questions:
				- 1. What is necessary for understanding the critical topics and understandings represented in the text?
				- 2. What did the author assume readers would bring to the text?
				- 3. What are m students bringing to the text?
				- 4. What are the connections students can make to other readings/content?
				- 5. How will I activate or gain access to my students' knowledge?
				- 6. Given what my students know, what else might my students need to know?
				- 7. How will I facilitate the building of necessary knowledge?
				- 8. How will I prompt students' integration of background knowledge with the text?
				- Thinking about these questions helps the educator identify strategies and activities that fulfill the ABCs of background knowledge-activate and assess, build, and prompt integration of relevant background knowledge (connect).
				- The following sections focus on instructional tools educators can use for each of the ABCs (see Table 7.1) as well as descriptions and examples.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671434768270_0.png)
				- **Activate and Assess Background Knowledge**
				- Multiple studies support the effectiveness of activating background knowledge for reading comprehension (Shanahan et al., 2010).
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671434843031_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671434857606_0.png)
				- Anticipation guides provide educators 'with some understanding of the quality and quantity of prior knowledge students have about the ideas in the reading assignment.' (Anders & Spitler, 2007, p.171).
				- They surface student readers' prior knowledge, challenge their preconceived ideas, and potentially help set a purpose for reading.

				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671435072014_0.png)
				- *__Build Background Knowledge Through Direct Teaching__*
				- We have addressed the A of the ABC chart; now it is time to focus on the B--building background knowledge.
				- The reader needs to translate the meaning of print and build new meanings simultaneously (Snow & Sweet, 2003).
				- One way to accomplish this is to directly teach key background knowledge before, during, or after reading.
				- It should be noted there has been some controversy over the teaching of background knowledge.
				- 'Going off the deep end' (ie spending too much valuable instructional time on background knowledge) can be problematic.
				- Tim Shanahan (2014) suggested that educators focus on key information; fill in with appropriate additional details before, during, and after reading; and use multiple texts for instruction.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671435255143_0.png)
				- *__Connect to Background Knowledge__*
				- Activating, assessing, and, in many instances, building knowledge are prerequisites to making connections to the text.
				- The skilled reader continuously connects and integrates his or her knowledge before, during, and after reading.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671435314957_0.png)
				- The ^^goal of comprehension^^ is to ultimately create a coherent representation of the text.
				- This ^^mental model^^, 'an aggregate of meaning,' is intended to be accessible as the students work with other related concepts and ideas.
				- In other words, connections between all components of the text and the reader's background knowledge should result in an understanding applicable to other learning situations.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671435405238_0.png)
				- *__Assess Students' Use of Knowledge__*
				- Finally, this discussion of instructional tools is also relevant to the topic of classroom based informal assessment.
				- Although standardized tests are useful, they do not provide necessary information for instructional decision-making in the classroom.
				-
		- ## CHAPTER 8: The Blueprint for Levels of Understanding and Inference
			- 'Reading comprehension is not a single entity that cna be explained by a unified cognitive model. Instead, it is the orchestrated product of a set of linguistic and cognitive processes operating on text and interacting with background knowledge, features of the text, and the purpose and goals of the reading situation.' - Castles, Rastle, and Nation (2018, p.28)
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671435582726_0.png)
			- ### LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING
				- The phrase ^^'levels of understanding'^^ often draws forth connections to Bloom's Taxonomy, a cognitive framework for increasingly deeper levels of learning (eg knowledge, comprehension, application) or commonly used descriptions (eg literal, inferential, evaluative, applied).
				- The focus, however, is on^^the relationship among the following-language and cognitive processes and skills, the surface code of the text, the underlying textbase, and the construction of a mental situation model^^  (see Figure 8.1).
				- Understanding this relationship requires digging deeper, making connections to theoretical models, and, thus, thinking a bit differently about the meaning of these terms and their connections to text.

				- ### ^^Three Levels of Understanding^^
				- The comprehension process involved when a reader constructs meaning have been described in various ways.
				- We have focused on the critical language and cognitive processes necessary for comprehending text.
				- But we can also think about how these processes interact with different levels of understanding conveyed by the text itself.
				- These levels that contribute to the reader's construction of meaning include:
				- ^^1) the surface code of the text, 2) the textbase, and 3) the construction of a mental model.^^
				- Researchers such as Kintsch and Rawson (2005) have theorized that levels of understanding are not entirely distinct from one another but rather work in combination to convey the intended meaning of the text.
				- ^^*__Level 1: Understanding the Surface Code__*^^
				- ^^The surface code is represented by the exact words and syntax of the text used by the author, which is what readers immediately recall.^^
				- Readers use their understanding of the word meaning and sentence construction to begin building the meaning of the text.
				- Yet, understanding this surface code does not represent deep comprehension of the text but rather an initial step in making meaning.
				- Educators often tap into this initial level of understanding by asking students to respond to text-based or text-dependent questions based on what they have just read.
				- ^^*__Level 2: Making Meaning From the Textbase__*^^
				- ^^Understanding the surface code sets the stage for making meaning from the textbase.^^
				- This level of understanding takes the reader beyond the words and sentences on the page.
				- While comprehending at the surface level, ^^the reader is able to recall what is on the page, but comprehending at the level of the textbase requires an understanding of the author's intended meaning.^^
				- ^^Constructing the textbase^^ requires the reader understand ^^1) how word meanings combine into idea units or propositions at the surface level^^ and ^^2) how these units of meaning work in combination with each other to communicate the underlying meaning of the text.^^
				- The sentences with in a text initially convey meaning, and the author carefully chooses precise words and sentence constructions to represent connections and intended ideas.
				- The author assumes that the reader will recognize these connections between ideas and, at the same time, integrate background knowledge to understand what is implied in the text.
				- Kintsch and Rawson (2005)noted, "Propositions are interrelated in a complex network, called the microstructure of the text...the microstructure itself is organized into higher-order units.
				- This global structure of a text is called the macrostructure' (p. 210).
				- These two structures were discussed in Chapter 2 as integral to understanding comprehension processes (see Table 8.1).
				- The microstructure and macrostructure together comprise the textbase of a text (Kintsch & Rawson, 2005).
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671441994805_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671442002317_0.png)
				- Educators are tapping into understanding of the textbase when they ask students to express their understanding of the connections among ideas within and between sentences or respond to questions that require integration of background knowledge.
				- ^^*__Level 3: Constructing a Situation or Mental Model of the Text__*^^
				- A skilled reader uses language and cognitive processes,  including the use of inferences, to integrate successive units of meaning at the surface and textbase levels, which is necessary for him or her to construct a situation or ^^mental model^^ of the text.
				- This mental representation of text includes information explicitly stated as well as implied in the text.
				- The mental model is ^^the reader's overall understanding of the situation expressed in the text.^^
				- The reader stores this in memory and hopefully gains access to it for future application.
				- ### The Role of Inference
				- Inferences are critical for the reader to construct the textbase and ultimately construct his or her overall understanding of the text.
				- These inferences play an essential role in how the reader forms a coherent representation of meaning.
				- The reader makes local and global coherence inferences at the textbase level that 1) connect ideas with and between sentences and 2) prompt the reader to integrate text information with relevant background knowledge through the use of cohesive devices.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671442666525_0.png)
				- Educators regularly pose questions based on diverse texts their students are reading.
				- These queries tap into varied levels of understanding.
				- The surface code provides the information necessary to answer the first question.
				- The second and third questions pose more of a challenge, however, given the need for students to go beyond the surface of the text (the exact words and phrases), use the textbase, and construct a mental model.
				- They require these fourth graders to understand relationships within and between the ideas expressed in sentences as well as what is not expressed directly, necessitating their integration of the text with their background knowledge.
				- In other words, the reader has to use what is explicitly stated and infer what is implied.
				- To answer the second question, students need to know that there are words whose job it is to tie up or create a bridge between the ideas in the sentences.
				- These words take their meaning from another part of the sentence or other sentences.
				- The skilled reader recognizes and infers these connections.
				- Students usually respond more easily to questions or tasks when the meaning is directly evident through the words and actions of the speaker or author, as in the first question.
				- Understanding is more complicated when students are required to infer the meaning.
				- The author does not usually provide all the information the students need to fully understand the text.
				- Rather, the author expects that the students will mine the words of the text and tap into their inferential processes and skills to make sense of what is being read.
				- If the ultimate goal of proficient reading is a deep understanding of the author's intended meaning, then students must go beyond the surface code of the text.
				- Understanding the underlying meaning and developing a situation or mental model depend on inferential process.
				-
			- ### CONNECTIONS TO READING COMPREHENSION
				- Successful comprehension depends not only on identifying the words in a text and understanding at the sentence level.
				- The reader also has to connect up information from different parts of the text and make inferences to fill the missing information in order to produce a coherent overall representation.' -Cain and Oakhill (2007, p.23)
				- ^^Comprehension^^ is^^a complex, integrative, and constructive process.^^
				- ^^Construction of meaning^^ results from ^^the reader's aggregating units of meaning that include textual information and related background knowledge.^^
				- The reader has to determine connections between these two elements that are interconnected via ^^syntactic^^ and ^^semantic^^ relationships (Kendeou, van den Broek, Helder, & Karlsson, 2014).
				- Readers use ^^inference^^ in combination with^^1) their knowledge of word meaning and syntax and^^  ^^2) any relevant background knowledge they have to determine these relationships.^^
				- Researchers determined that the ability to inference is also a predictor of current and later reading comprehension skills (Perfetti, Landi, & Oakhill, 2005).
				-
			- ### INFERENCE DEFINED
				- Texts cannot be understood without contributions from readers.
				- Texts provide instructions to readers about how to use relevant knowledge and experience to build an understanding of the text.
				- This building of understanding depends heavily on the reader's ability to draw inferences. - Elbro and Buch-Iversen (2013, p.435).
				- Educators often connect inference with a simple formula such as picture/text + background knowledge = inferencing (Westby, 2011).
				- Although these are acceptable responses, they do not capture the complexity of inference.
				- A comprehensive definition acknowledges that inference plays a role in comprehension at the sentence, paragraph, and text level.
				- Consider this definition: "^^Inference^^ is ^^the identification of meaningful relations between the various parts of the text, and between those parts and the reader's background knowledge^^' (Kendeou, Bohn-Gettler, White, & van den Broek, 2008, p.259).
				- This description directly acknowledges that generating inferences involves identifying.
				- Connections between parts of the text (eg sentences)
				- Relationships between the text and background knowledge
				- It clarifies the importance of the individual integrating information within or across texts while simultaneously using his or her background knowledge to fill in what is not explicitly stated (Kendeou et al., 2014).
				- To accomplish this, the reader gains access to and applies necessary inferences that fall into two general categories-local and global.
				-
			- ### NECESSARY INFERENCES: LOCAL AND GLOBAL COHERENCE
				- ^^Local coherence inferences^^ are necessary to ^^integrate information from adjacent pieces of text^^, whereas ^^global coherence inferences^^ are used to fill in ^^details not explicitly stated^^ that are needed to construct^^a globally coherent representation of text meaning, for example inferences about themes, morals, and settings.^^ ' - Language and Reading Research Consortium (2018, P.117)
				- Before delving into the differences between these two, it might be worthwhile to further define the terms *coherent* and *coherence,* used more than once throughout this text.
				- Knowledge of morphology can help infer the meaning of words.
				- The morphemes within *coherent* and *coherence* provide useful clues: *co*-together or with, *here*- stick or cling, with the suffixes -*ent* and *-ence* indicating grammatical role (adjective, noun).
				- When the ideas presented in a text stick together, they are linked in a logical and organized manner.
				- When the ^^text is cohesive^^, the ^^reader understands how the ideas and relationships presented within it work together and contribute to understanding.^^
				- Local and global coherence inferences serve different purposes but work in concert with each other to make a text cohesive.
				- Constructing a situational or mental model of the text requires the reader to use both categories of inference while simultaneously monitoring comprehension for any disruptions to coherence and adapt and adjust as needed.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671443423092_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671443433850_0.png)
				- ### Local Coherence Inferences
				- The comprehender needs to work out th^^e syntactic structure and sense of each sentence and integrate information from different sentences^^ to ^^establish local coherence^^.' - Cain and Oakhill (2007, p. xii)
				- As the reader works through the text, he or she does not only needs to make meaning of individual sentences but also must determine how those sentences connect and combine to make sense.
				- The reader not only uses the author's words and syntax but also uses cohesive devices to bridge ideas within the text.
				- Cohesive devices signal intended relationships within the text and include cohesive ties and connectives.
				- These syntactic and semantic elements are necessary for the reader to bridge and integrate information within and between sentences and paragraphs.
				- *__Cohesive Ties__*
				- ^^Cohesive ties^^ are ^^anaphoric devices^^, which basically means they are ^^words or phrases that take their meaning from another part of the sentence or sentences.^^
				- For example, pronouns can stand in for or replace a word or phrase referred to in another part of the sentence or another sentence.
				- Some anaphoric devices prompt ^^lexical cohesion^^ (cohesion between words) through ^^repetition of a noun or phrase or the use of substitution or synonyms^^.
				- ^^Ellipsis^^ is another type of ^^anaphoric device^^ that requires ^^completing a thought by retrieving meaning from another part of the sentence.^^
				- ^^Anaphoric devices^^ ^^tie up the meaning of sentences, making the larger sections of text understandable.^^
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671518861624_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671518867206_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671518875366_0.png)
				- ^^*__Connectives__*^^
				- 'Findings point to an important role for connectives in the construction of coherent situation models of text from an early age and demonstrate that connectives help (not hinder) young children to process and establish coherence in text.' - Cain and Nash (2011, p.428)
				- ^^Connectives^^-^^conjunctions and adverbs^^- are ^^words or phrases that signal logical relationships between parts of sentences^^ (eg, the relationship between clauses in a sentence and the relationship of each clause to the sentence itself).
				- They cue specific types of relationships between events (eg, causal, temporal), consequently providing direction to the reader about how to integrate information.
				- Researchers found that connectives facilitate accurate inferences both during and after reading.
				- Connectives can be grouped based on differences in meaning.
				- For example, ^^temporal connectives^^ ^^indicate sequence in time and include words such as *before, after,* and *while*.^^
				- ^^Causal connectives^^ ^^signal cause-and-effect relationships, and adversatives express a contrast in condition or a form of opposition.^^
				- Table 8.4 identifies the most common categories based on the meaning conveyed (eg, *why, when, what happened, under what conditions*) and provides examples.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671519147063_0.png)
				- ### Global Coherence Inferences
				- ^^Global coherence inferences^^ are not dependent on syntactic and semantic signals but rather on^^the reader's ability to gain access to activate semantic knowledge networks.^^
				- ^^Knowledge^^ is ^^organized^^ in^^the memory based on meaningful connections among concepts, facts, ideas, and beliefs.^^
				- Students not only have to integrate meaning within and between sentences as they construct mental models, but they must also use their knowledge base to identify what is not stated to fill in the details.
				- Cognitive scientists such as Daniel Willingham pointed to the facilitative nature of knowledge, indicating that:
				- People with more general knowledge have richer associations among the concepts in memory; and when associations are strong, they become available to the reading process automatically.
				- That means the person with rich general knowledge rarely has to interrupt reading in order to consciously search for connections (2006, p.30)
				- In what specific ways does the student's construction of global coherence inferences include his or her understanding?
				- The literature says that ^^the reader responds to the demands of the text and perceived task and uses inference making for a variety of reasons, such as^^:
				- ^^Understanding the cause of events^^
				- ^^Predicting future actions^^
				- ^^Identifying setting^^
				- ^^Identifying character's motives, beliefs, and traits^^
				- ^^Understanding character relationships^^
				- ^^Drawing conclusions^^
				- ^^Understanding author's view and/or biases (Westby, 2011)^^
				- Although this chapter focuses on understanding written language, prior to becoming readers, children begin generating inferences based on experiences, observations, visual representations (pictures, cartoons, videos), and eventually text.
				- As students move up through the grades, it is the words, the written language of a text, that carries the author's meaning, whether delivered through read-alouds, technology, or independent reading.
				- In addition, the quantity and quality of the reader's inferences change over time with instruction and experience.
				- Local and global inference making are necessary for students to construct a coherent representation of text and create a mental model of the text.
				- We have a responsibility to understand how these two types of inferences differ and how to translate that knowledge into practice.
				- ### Facilitating Factors
				- A number of factors either support or interfere with the reader's ability to use both types of inferences to construct a mental model of the text, including
				- Access to vocabulary and knowledge
				- Student's standards of coherence
				- Working memory (Oakhill et al., 2014)
				- *__Vocabulary and Knowledge__*
				- The importance and development of vocabulary and knowledge has been discussed in previous chapters.
				- The skilled reader brings knowledge of word meaning, syntactic structures, and text structures, along with general and domain-specific information, to the text.
				- As noted earlier, building a coherent representation of text requires the reader to interpret and integrate the language units across the text and also connect to his or her background knowledge to infer what is not explicitly stated.
				- The experts found that well-developed knowledge networks support efficient activation of and access to the knowledge that is particularly necessary for global coherence inferences (Elleman, 2017).
				- Having background knowledge, however, does not necessarily ensure that the reader will automatically make an appropriate inference.
				- Problems with knowledge can be multifaceted.
				- For example, the struggling or novice inferencer may not have sufficient knowledge of content, easily access what he or she knows, or even recognize the need or relevance of what he or she does know.
				- *__Standards of Coherence__*
				- Standards of coherence represent types and strength of coherence the reader strives for as they interact with text.' - van den Broek, Bohn-Gettler, Kendeou, Carlson, and White (2011, p. 124)
				- ^^*Coherence*^^ refers to ^^the way in which text elements, including words, phrases, sentences, and the paragraph or passage as a whole, work together and contribute to constructing meaning.^^
				- ^^The skilled reader sets his or her ow^^n ^^standards or criteria for comprehension^^ (implicitly or explicitly) ^^depending on the reading situation, which includes the reader's perception of the task, the demands of the text, and his or her abilities and attitudes.^^
				- The reader sets goals before and during reading and determines what ^^degree of understanding^^ is ^^good enough to accomplish the intended result.^^
				- What constitutes good enough depends on^^1) the types of coherence necessary^^  (eg, referential, causal) and ^^2) the strength of understanding necessary for achieving the identified goal (eg, reading for learning versus entertainment).^^
				- Although inference making is often automatic, skilled readers will note any speed bumps that interfere.
				- Not coincidentally, skilled readers are more adept at monitoring, adjusting, and taking necessary actions to maintain coherence (Oakhill, Hartt, & Samols, 2005).
				- For example, good comprehenders will adjust reading time when goals are focused on responding to text-based questions rather than reading for enjoyment.
				- *__Memory__* Because knowledge is so important to inference, it makes sense that memory is also a critical contributor.
				- ^^Long-term memory^^ ^^provides the reader with a storehouse of language-based information that can hopefully be easily accessed.^^
				- ^^Short-term memory^^ ^^holds information just long enough so the reader can decide what is more relevant to the task.^^
				- ^^Working memory^^ takes over ^^preserving this information a bit longer so the reader can engage in necessary processes^^, including integrating information from different sentences and background knowledge, monitoring comprehension, and maintaining coherence.
				- Gathercole and Alloway (2008) described the job of working memory as 'preservation of information while simultaneously processing same or other information' (p.13).
				- Inferential processes may take place automatically, but other processes are more strategic, necessitating attentional and memory resources.
				- ^^Bridging inferences^^ ^^require that the reader hold on to current idea units (word, phrase, clause) while identifying their relationships to what has been explicitly stated earlier.^^
				- ^^Gap-filling inferences^^ ^^depend on the reader easily gaining access to background knowledge and integrating this information with the words and sentences presented by the author.^^
				- The ^^demand placed on working memory^^ ^^increases as the reader moves from literal to inferential understanding.^^
				-
			- ### DESIGNING AND DELIVERING COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTION
				- This critical skill supports students' integration of explicit and implicit ideas and information within and across texts.
				- Designing and delivering effective instruction requires a deep knowledge base, one that allows educators to answer questions such as
				- Why is this important?
				- Why did I choose that activity?
				- Why did I use that strategy?
				- Why is that student struggling?
				- What can I do to improve the student's understanding?
				- Instructional activities should focus on developing students' understanding of relationships between ideas:
				- Those directly expressed in the text (surface level)
				- Their own ideas (textbase and mental model)
				- ### Overview of Instructional Practices
				- Ellerman's study, in concert with other reviews (Hall, 2016), provided direction for instructional practice and emphasized the importance of teaching students how to work with text to generate inferences.
				- Based on these findings and others, this discussion focuses on how teachers can incorporate strategies that support deeper understanding of text:
				- Questioning
				- Use of visual and textual clues
				- Use of graphic organizers
				- Think alouds
				- Combination of strategies
				- Choosing challenging texts that are focused on enduring understandings or themes is critical to implementing the blueprint components.
				- ### A Targeted Instructional Approach: Local Coherence Inferences
				- Cohesive devices, including cohesive ties and connectives, are the semantic or syntactic cues that signal relationships within and across sentences in text.
				- Effective instruction begins with students understanding the *why*(purpose), the *what* (cohesive devices), and the *how* (strategies, activities) of inference making for local coherence.
				- The following questions provide general guidance for teachers preparing instruction:
				- How will I explain the function of the cohesive devices?
				- Which type will I target based on student understanding of the text iteslf?
				- How will I explain the difference between targeted cohesive ties and connectives?
				- Which text examples will I use?
				- Which are most relevant to my students' needs?
				- How will I explicitly teach strategies for acquiring and applying skills?
				- Are there manipulatives, gestures, and/or visuals that could support/scaffold student understanding?
				- How will I provide for individual, partner, or small-group interaction?
				- *__Intentional Instruction: Cohesive Ties__*
				- Cohesive ties link up units of meaning within and between sentences.
				- They take their meaning from other parts of sentences or other sentences in the text.
				- Examples of the more common types have been provided:
				- Pronoun referents
				- Synonyms
				- Substitutions
				- Repetition of nouns and phrases
				- Ellipsis
				- The teacher can introduce and model the following steps as a general strategy for teaching cohesive ties:
				- 1. Identify targeted words and phrases in the text.
				- 2. Frame a question or task.
				- 3. Search for clues or connections
				- 4. Make the connections visually or verbally.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671527767800_0.png)
				- Note that the pronoun referents are underlined, providing a visual cue.
				- The goal is for students to eventually use these steps to self-question and make these connections.
				- Effective strategy instruction requires ample guided and independent practice before students can internalize and automatically apply these skills.
				- The informed educator is on the look out for instructional opportunities as he or she prepares the text for instruction.
				- This selection describes four young African American men involved in a sit-in as 'peaceful activists' and uses both synonyms and substitutions to stand in for this phrase.
				- The teacher can highlight these with a different visual cue, such as drawing lines that connect the two.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671527748907_0.png)
				- These examples highlight the importance of teaching students about the role of cohesive ties (pronoun references, substitutions) and how they contribute to understanding text.
				- There is an example of repetition in the second text.
				- Did you notice the word *students* was repeated in the last sentence of the paragraph?
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671527860272_0.png)
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671527871335_0.png)
				- *__Intentional Instruction: Connectives__*
				- Connectives carry meaning and signal specific relationships between words and parts of a sentence.
				- Effective instruction focuses on function and specific contribution to meaning.
				- In addition, activities that call for identification of connectives and question how the connective contributes to meaning are necessary for students to develop automatic processing of these cohesive devices.
				- A different paragraph from 'The Sit-In Movement' (USHistory.org, 2016) offers an occasion to check understanding of different connectives through questioning (temporal, causal, adversatives). For example:
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671528028151_0.png)
				- The teacher might also tell the student that there are conjunctions used to signal relationships that indicate time, conditions, or a contrast of ideas in this paragraph and then asks
				- Can you find a word that is a clue to sequence or time? *(before)*
				- Can you find a word that infers condition of or possibility? *(if)*
				- Is there a word that conveys a contrast in  ideas? *(but)*
				- ### A Targeted Instructional Approach: Global Coherence Inferences
				- Global inferences are necessary for deep comprehension and depend on the reader's access to related background knowledge.
				- The students fill in the gaps in text by connecting their knowledge with the information provided by the author.
				- The informed educator prepares for instruction by identifying the need for gap-filling or global inferences.
				- They consider questions such as
				- How will I explain this type of inference?
				- How will I explain the importance of using background knowledge?
				- Which text examples will I use?
				- Which are most relevant to my students' needs?
				- What strategies or activities will I use to engage students in acquiring and applying skills?
				- Are there manipulative, gestures, and/or visuals that could support/scaffold student understanding?
				- How will I provide for individual, partner, or small group interaction?
				- *__Intentional Instruction: A Strategy for Global Coherence Inferences__*
				- Global inferences support students as they identify causes, make predictions, and draw conclusions from the text.
				- Table 8.5 outlines a strategy for generating global inferences that can serve multiple purposes and identifies teacher and student actions.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671528377127_0.png)
				- Pictures are often used with younger students to build background knowledge and generate inferences.
				- Visuals that are connected to critical topics can also be powerful vehicles for instruction with older students.
				- Let's consider how pictures depicting the incident that resulted in the Montgomery bus boycott could be used either before or during reading of a text such as *Rosa Parks: My Story* (Parks & Haskins, 1999) to support inference making.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671528485001_0.png)
				- Readers are asked to make inferences for varied reasons.
				- For example, young children may be asked to infer goals, emotions, or personality characteristics related to principal characters or individuals in a text.
				- Teachers can use the steps provided here as well as other effective strategies, including graphic organizers, visual and textual clues, prompts, and questions.
				- An example using textual clues to infer characteristics or motivation can be used to describe a character.
				- *__Intentional Instruction: Graphic Organizers__*
				- Graphic organizers are designed to prompt connections between text and knowledge and can support the reader.
				- The organizer shown in Figure 8.6 reminds students to use what they have heard or read, visualized, and learned about the grasshopper.
				- They can use the written prompts to respond to questions about his personality (eg, lazy, irresponsible) or motivation (eg, enjoy life, have no worries).
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671528641766_0.png)
				- Other organizers may use questions to prompt purposeful connections between the author's words and the student's background knowledge (Beers, 2003).
				- Although meaningful for all students, this approach is particularly helpful for those who have the necessary knowledge base but do not surface it while reading.
				- They need additional supports that prompt them to make direct connections from their knowledge base to the text and integrate relevant information (Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 2013).
				- The reader is often required to infer the *why* or cause of an event and draw a conclusion.
				- For example, readers are asked to explain why Benjamin Banneker wrote to Thomas Jefferson about slavery (see Figure 8.7).
				- The teacher initially models the completion of the organizer and then scaffolds instruction and fades responses.
				- The strategy supports students by combining questioning and visual cues, and it can be used for varied inferences, depending on the question.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671528883009_0.png)
				-
			- ### ASSESSING FOR LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING AND INFERENCE
			  collapsed:: true
				- The informed educator can glean information on varied aspects of reading comprehension from formal and informal assessments.
				- Standardized assessments usually include tasks to assess comprehension but are constructed differently depending on the test author's view of reading proficiently (Farrall, 2012).
				- Educators need to consider this and what tests are actually measuring to effectively use assessment data.
				- For example, the Reading Inventory and Scholastic Evaluation (RISE), developed by Strategic Education Research Partnerships (2015) and Educational Testing Services, is a diagnostic reading test (Grades 5-10) that contains six subtests.
				- The reading comprehension measure asks students to respond to literal and inferential questions.
				- The Qualitative Reading Inventory (Leslie & Caldwell, 2017) includes explicit and implicit comprehension questions.
				- Figure 8.8 is a continuation of the assessment chart embedded in previous chapters.

			- ### SUMMARY: HELPING STUDENTS USE INFERENCE TO CONSTRUCT MEANING
			  collapsed:: true
				- The blueprint calls attention to the importance of developing the ability to comprehend and work with different levels of understanding, which includes making the necessary inferences so that the reader can bridge ideas across sentences as well integrate background knowledge to fill the gaps in text.
				- This chapter focused on varied aspects of inference, including its definition, its contribution to comprehension, and different necessary types of inference making.
				- For teachers to design and deliver effective instruction, it is critical that they understand the role of local and global inferences in comprehension and potential challenges that might interfere with students' comprehension.
				- This chapter addressed instructional planning considerations, including setting, materials, and explicit teaching.
				- More important, it has explored recommendations and examples of implementation of effective strategies (use of questioning, graphic organizers, and text clues, singly or in combination).

			- Content goals and objectives target the development of this knowledge base (see Figure 9.3).
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671529667403_0.png)
			- Coming of age and related understandings was the critical topic identified for fifth grade.
			- The blueprint calls for teachers to develop students' abilities related to comprehending these big ideas and expressing their understanding.
			- In the sample instructional unit shown in Figure 9.4, fifth-grade students explore the ideas related to coming of age while building background knowledge and a deeper understanding of change.
			- It particularly focuses on varied elements of narrative structure and how they contribute to the reader's comprehension of text.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671529872958_0.png)+
			- ### Planning Focused Lessons
			- The unit organizer serves as the foundation for the teacher to design lesson plans necessary to accomplish the goals of the unit.
			- Lesson plans are focused on specific objectives detailed, and usually limited to a brief time period, and typically include the related goal, objectives, sequence of lesson activities, and assessment.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671529989924_0.png)
			- Delivery of the coming of age instructional unit would require the teacher to design multiple lesson plans.
			- What might an introductory lesson plan look like for this unit?
			- As you consider the sample lesson shown in Figure 9.6, keep the blueprint in mind and notice how the teacher has purposefully incorporated its components to support the student's ability to extract and construct meaning from texts.

			- *__Fidelity Checklist for Reading Comprehension Instruction__*
			- Each of the previous chapters described the multidimensional nature of comprehension, along with critical contributors to comprehension, including the design and delivery of informed instructional practices, adaptations, and informal assessment approaches.
			- A single brief checklist of all observable behaviors is neither possible nor manageable because the process of extracting and constructing meaning is complex and depends on multiple skills.
			- Therefore, the Fidelity Checklist for Reading Comprehension Instruction shown in Figure 9.8 consists of five sections.
			- Each section reflects essential language and the cognitive processes and skills discussed.
			- Implementing change takes time, so this checklist is not intended to be nor should it be used in its entirety at a single point in time.
			- Rather, each component should be used with a focus on specific behaviors necessary to ensure student ability to understand word meaning, connect idea units, integrate background knowledge and, ultimately, create a mental model of text.
