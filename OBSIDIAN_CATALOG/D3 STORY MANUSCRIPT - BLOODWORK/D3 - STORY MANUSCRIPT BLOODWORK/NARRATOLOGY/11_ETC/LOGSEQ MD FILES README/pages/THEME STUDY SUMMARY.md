	- ^^**McKee refers to theme as a controlling idea**^^
		- **controlling idea - a single sentence describing how and why life undergoes change from one condition of existence at the beginning to another.**
		- **creative discipline - a principle to guide aesthetic choices toward what is appropriate or inappropriate for your story.**
		- ^^**The more solid and finite your controlling idea, the more singular, and clear, the more rich the story becomes.**^^

- # **NARRATIVE DESIGN by MADISON SMART BELL**

	- ^^*__"Most stories don't require a discussion of theme separate from plot, character and above all, design."__*^^
	- ^^*__"Insight into a story's theme usually a simultaneous even with comprehension of its design--an abstraction to be inserted into a story like a ghost into a machine."__*^^
	- *__Bell infers that theme is ultimately the answer to a reader's question, 'why?'__*

	-
	- *What's the big picture?*
	- *Why should I care?* (fucking elementary bullshit)
	- *What's the big picture?*
	- *The theme is the container for your story.*
	- *A well-defined theme gives a story a kind of focus, a center.*
	- ^^*__A well-defined theme allows a writer to distill the ideas, to present them in a simple fashion, to tell the story that will last longer than half an hour.__*^^
	-
	  > **A good story is literal in the same sense that a child’s
drawing is literal. When a child draws, he doesn’t
intend to distort but to set down exactly what he sees,
and as his gaze is direct, he sees the lines that create
motion. Now the lines of motion that interest the
writer are usually invisible. They are the lines of
spiritual motion. And in this story you should be on
the lookout for such things as the action of grace in
the Grandmother’s soul, and not for the dead bodies. 
-Flannery O'Connor**  
	- *__Inexperienced authors can have  a tendency to over burden their story with literal representations of their theme.__*
	- ^^*__A proper theme is obfuscated, esoteric, and abstract. Proper use of narrative design uses literary devices to weave theme throughout the story.__*^^
	- **Theme can be interpreted as a *design principal.***
		- **IE: A car that is _fast_ at a standstill.**
	- ^^**A method to isolate the theme in narrative pieces is to reduce the story to its most basic components.**^^
	- ^^*__Theme penetrates every form of literary device, structure, and thus narrative design.__*^^
		- **This point is reinforced by Bloom, Bell, and even Nash.**
