		- ## The Value Proposition
		  id:: 626c6d70-a74f-46b9-9764-31ee04dd8407
			- The *value proposition* is the benefit that the customer derives from the product or service the entrepreneur is offering
				- *The reason the customer will buy.*
			- *Benefits* are intangibles such as
				- *better health*
				- *saving time and money*
				- *reliability*
					-
					  id:: 626c777e-9d4b-4958-956e-ed46e9ddc113
						- *Who is the customer?*
							- A *clear and precise customer definition increases the chances that the business concept will meet the customers' needs*
				- ## The Solution Being Offered
				  id:: 626c777e-f805-468f-9dc6-a2929fd2eacc
					- A *solution* to the *problem* the customer is facing.

	  collapsed:: true
		- *Sex Culture on the internet is either fuzzy hbo or twitter*
			- All these websites online lack character. Blogs that are just half-assed top of the mind SEO fueled character dumps so they can funnel someone to an affiliate.
				- Knowledge is just fact dumps apparently.
				- Either that or on a 12 year old website.
				- Or on a product's website.
				- Or on a fetlife post from some random dude with his ass as a profile pic.
				- *its all so fucking lame*
				- *i thought bdsm shit was supposed to be cool*
				- *its actually just a bunch of gate keeping assholes or the next webmaster billionare*
		- *Porn is Sexual Culture*
			- What is the alternative? A convoluted auto-interpretation of what one's sexuality is? Is sexuality different the sexual culture? Is there a sexual culture that isn't rooted in kink or LGBTQ? Is Porn the only modern *vanilla* culture that West has?
			- A lot of sexual education information lacks *context*
				- *context* is culture. culture is *porn*
	- # Gapesoda.com's value proposition

		- *Character*
			- Confident, Intelligent, Sexy, Shameless, Iconic, Effortless, Cool, Mysterious, *Stimulating*, *Arousing*
		- *Culture*
			- Pornographic Brinksmanship. Unfiltered. Authentic. The edge sex.
		- *Quality Knowledge Presented Efficiently*
			- The internet is full of bulllshit. We use models.

	- # Gapesoda.com's Customer Definition
	  collapsed:: true
		- The customer is every degenerate who's combed the dregs of fetlife, grindr, tinder, bumble, etc. and have decided that, shit, honestly, most people think the shit I'm into is fucked up. I mean it is. But, I know there are people out there. Thing is, no one's doing it for the *virtue* or the *curiosity* or the *passion* of it anymore. Shiieeeet.
		- Except for this bitch. She's my customer.
