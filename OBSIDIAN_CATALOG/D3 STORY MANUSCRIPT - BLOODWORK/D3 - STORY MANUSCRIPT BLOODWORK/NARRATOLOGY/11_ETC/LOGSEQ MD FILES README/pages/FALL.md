- 4:41
   Becky reaches for the next rung. A piece of rusty ladder breaks off. Beky stops climbing, shaken. Hunter encourages Becky to keep climbing.  
- 4:50
   After a bit of climbing, the girls take a break.  then stop for a while to have a drink.  According to Hunter, the lines indicate that  
  they are halfway up, which would mean that they  have climbed 1000 feet, or the height of the  
  Eifel Tower. The girls continue to climb.  
- 5:06
  The wind picks up gradually as they climb higher.  
- ## S6

  The two arrive at the top of the tower. Both Becky and Hunter celebrate.  
- 5:55
   Hunter  takes out her drone and films the view from the top.  
- 5:59
  But of course, Hunter doesn’t stop there. Hunter lowers herself to the edge of the ledge and hangs her body off the side, her hands grip the edge, the only things keeping her from falling. Becky reluctantly films the stunt with the drone.  
- 6:10
   Hunter tells Becky that she has to hang off the edge too. Becky trusts Hunter. She lowers herself down and hangs off the edge.  
- 6:16
  The two embrace as they have done the impossible and conquered their fears.  
- 6:24
  Up next, it is now time to do the grand  gesture: Becky takes out Dan’s ashes and  
  spreads it to the wind, and the two share  a heartfelt moment reminiscing about Dan.  
- 6:34
  The two tuck the drone and the rest of their backpack in preparation for the climb down.  
- ## S8
- 6:42
  Becky lowers herself down the ladder to go first. She bears her weight on the first rung when the ladder breaks from beneath her.  
- 6:59
   Becky hangs helplessly mid-air, the lifeline connected to Hunter being the only thing that prevents her fall.  
- 7:03
   Hunter loops the rope around the tower and slowly pull Becky back up.  
- 7:08
   Meanwhile, the entire length of the  ladder is now ripped off of the main pole,  crashing down to the ground behind Becky.  
- 7:16
  Once Becky makes it back up, she and Hunter laugh  in relief, but it doesn’t take long for them to  
  realize that the ladder is now gone, making it  impossible for them to climb their way down.  
- # A5
- ## S9
- 7:27
  They try checking their phones, but of  course there is no signal this far up  
  the ground.  
- 7:35
   They then discover a small  emergency box at the bottom of the pole, which contains binoculars and a flare gun.  
- 7:45
   Not only that, Becky’s backpack  which contains their water and drone is now stuck on a satellite dish below them, very  much out of reach.  
- 7:50
   Becky begins to panic, even more so when she realizes that there is now a  massive gash on her thigh.  
- 7:55
  Hunter assures her that  
   the loud crashing noises caused by the ladders  falling earlier must have drawn some attention,  
  and help should be on the way. Hearing  this, Becky calms down and agrees to wait.  
- 8:05
  Becky pees off the ledge, because  she is no longer able to hold it. The two laugh  
  lightheartedly at this, and proceed to try and  kill time by vlogging.  
- 8:16
- Hunter ends up opening  up about the reason why she started vlogging,  which turns out to be because of Dan’s death.
- ## S10
- 8:21
  A few hours later, Hunter decides to check out her  surroundings using a binocular, and discovers an  
  RV parked not too far away from the tower.  
- 8:32
   Hunter takes out her phone, and remembers that there was signal  when they were at the bottom, looking at the amount of likes on her recently posted picture.  This means that if they lower their phone enough, they would eventually be able to get a signal.  
- 8:47
  Hunter sets up an Instagram post calling to her followers for help, then secures her phone with  a hair tie.  
- 8:52
  She then lowers it using the rope,  
   but they still don’t hear a ding that marks that  it has been posted.  
- 8:57
   Hunter  decides to hang herself down the remaining ladder,  but unfortunately, it still won’t post.  
- 9:02
  Right after, Becky comes up with the idea to simply drop  the phone down, but to keep it from breaking, they  
  tuck it inside Hunter’s shoe, and pads it with  socks, and a push-up bra before dropping it below.  
- 9:21
  Just so happens, Becky notices a tattoo  on Hunter’s feet, and at the same time,  
  Hunter sees a guy and his dog standing right  below, though he seems to be preoccupied  
  talking on the phone.  
- 9:34
  Hunter and Becky  keep screaming, before Becky decides to throw down her pair of shoes in hopes that he’d  notice, but he doesn’t and starts walking away.  
- 9:42
  Becky takes out the flare gun and is about  to shoot it, but Hunter tells her to wait,  
  because apparently, there are people parked  with their RV not too far from the tower, so they  
  should wait until sundown to fire the flare.  
- 9:56
  While they wait, Becky kills time by browsing  through her phone looking at old videos,  and notices an odd clip.   She sees Hunter staring at her and Dan in jealousy at their wedding.  
- 10:01
   Hunter snaps  Becky back to reality  
  by announcing to her that it’s time to  shoot the flare.  
- ## S11
- 10:13
  Becky does as asked, while Hunter waves her phone  around with her flash turned on.  
- 10:16
  Luckily, the two men in the RV notice them,  and proceed to take their RV to the gate,  
  right where Hunter’s car is parked.  
- 10:26
  But instead of heading for the tower,  
  they instead break into Hunter’s car  and steal it away, crushing their hopes.  
- 10:34
  The two best friends are forced to try  to sleep up on the tower that night,  
  until Hunter almost falls and  Becky pulls her back upright.  
- # A6
- ## S12
- 10:41
  It is here that Becky points out the tattoo she just saw on Hunter’s bare feet,  
  which contains the numbers 1,4,3, of which are the numbers Dan always said  
  whenever Becky asked him to say “I love you.”  
- 10:51
  Hunter confesses that she and Dan used to have an affair.  
- 10:57
  It is Morning. Becky asks Hunter more about the affair.  
- 11:00
  Hunter  insists that she did fall in love with Dan. She ended the affair right before  
  Becky and Dan’s wedding.  
- 11:05
  Hunter says she ended it because her friendship was more important to her than love.  
- ## S13
- 11:16
  Soon after, an alarm on Becky’s phone rings,  marking 24 hours since they’ve been stuck  
  on the tower. This gives them clarity that no help  is coming, and Becky begins wishing that they  
  had their drone with them, but it’s stuck  inside the backpack on the satellite dish.  
- 11:30
  Hunter decides to go  down there and take the backpack.  
  She anchors her carabiner around  the pole, and begins to descend.  
- 11:50
  Unfortunately, she falls short from reaching it. Being the reckless daredevil she is, she unhooks herself from the rope,and jumps on the dish, successfully reaching her backpack.  
- 12:01
  However, now the rope is out of reach.  
  so she  takes out a selfie stick from the backpack.  
  She successfully hooks the backpack on the  rope, before making a precarious jump on it.  
- 12:20
  Hunter ascends, and almost makes  it back to the top, but then…  
  Hunter falls, and Becky starts crying. But when  she looks down, she finds Hunter still hanging  
  on the rope, except now her hands injured,  making her incapable of climbing back up.  
- 12:37
  Becky then uses all of her strength, and luckily,  she manages to pull Hunter back to safety.  
- # A7
- ## S14
- 12:40
   They decide to write a note, and tuck it onto the drone before sending it away.  
  Unfortunately, it runs out of juice before it  makes it too far, forcing them to send it back.  
- 13:04
  Now out of ideas, Becky appears  desperate, but Hunter assures her  
  that they’ll find a way out soon enough.  
- 13:13
  Later that night, Becky awakens from her  
  sleep to find that Hunter has died, and her corpse  is ravaged by vultures. Luckily, it’s all but a  
  bad dream.  
- 13:25
   Upon seeing the red light above her, an  idea comes to her mind: they have to climb up, and  
   charge the drone using Hunter’s makeshift charger. They then wait until morning to do it.  
- ## S15
- 13:36
   Hunter’s hands have severe  rope burns, it’s all up to Becky. Despite her injured thigh, she climbs up to  the top, with the encouragement from Hunter.  
- 13:42
  When Becky reaches the top, she unravels the light  socket, before plugging the charger in there.  
- 13:53
  She hangs on while she waits for the drone to charge,  until at some point, a vulture begins to mess  
  with her because of the wound on her thigh.  
- 14:00
   The  vulture even manages to knock her backpack down.  
   Becky clings close to the pole,  and manages to keep the drone safe and  
  sound. Becky  slides back down and pukes her gut out.  
- 14:11
  They now have to wait for the diner  to open to send the drone there,  
  but due to the lack of food and exhaustion, Becky  struggles to not pass out.  
- 14:20
   Hunter helps her stay  awake by keeping a conversation with her,  until it is time for them to send the drone.  
- # A8
- ## S16
- 14:25
  They once again tuck a note on the drone,  and send it flying out to the diner.  
  Again, it's too bad that it gets hit by a passing  truck just before reaching its destination.  
- 14:44
  Hopeless, they watch the day go by, until Becky  voices that she can’t possibly survive another  
  day out here, but Hunter reminds her to stay  strong.  
- 14:55
   Realizing that her best friend is right, Becky asks Hunter for her other shoe so  she can throw her phone down this time,  
  since it's the very last thing they can do. Well,  this time Hunter says no, because as it turns out,  
- 15:04
  Hunter was never up there with her this  whole time.   Hunter has actually died a while ago, when  she fell after retrieving the backpack,  and her dead body is now lying on top of  the dish below, being eaten by a vulture.  
- ## S17
- 15:18
  The grief-stricken Becky has been alone this  whole time but instead of acknowledging it,  
  conjures up a delusion of her best  friend so that she won’t feel so alone.  
- 15:27
  Finally hit by reality, Becky breaks down crying,  while harsh wind blows around her. She remembers  
  her father, and how much she loves him, and  decides to record a goodbye message, seemingly  has given up on trying to survive.  
- 15:43
  On the other  side of the story, her concerned father has been trying to contact her and find her whereabouts.  
- 15:49
  On the next day, we see our girl Becky still sitting up on the tower, and her injured leg has  drawn the attention of a hungry vulture.  
- 15:54
   It begins pecking on Becky’s wound, so with the last of her  strength, she yanks it off and bashes its head in,  
  instantly killing it.  
- 16:05
  Becky devours  the vulture raw out of hunger, revealing that  there is still hope in her after all.  
- # A9
- ## S18
- 16:09
  Becky  musters up the courage to climb down  to reach for Hunter’s shoe, her last hope.  
  She then releases the rope and lands on top of  the satellite dish, scaring the vulture that is  
  devouring Hunter's flesh.  
- 16:33
  Right after, she sends a  text to her father noting her whereabouts, before  
   tucking it inside Hunter’s shoe. Becky says sorry  before sticking the shoe inside Hunter’s exposed gut, and throwing her dead body down to ensure  that the phone doesn’t get crushed by the fall.  But then, a screw on the rusty dish  comes off, putting her in danger.  
- 16:49
  Becky's father who is rushing to the tower location.  
- 16:59
  Police  officers and medics gathered around the tower, right when Becky’s father arrives and witnesses  a view of a dead body covered in a tarp.  
- 17:04
  Just as the father fears that his daughter  is dead, Becky calls for him and rushes up to  
  him, to let him know that she is safe and sound. This is where the movie ends.
