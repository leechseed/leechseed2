	- # Bloom's Reading Comp + Blueprint Format
	  collapsed:: true
		- Here we try to correlate reading comprehension with bloom's taxonomy of learning.
		- ## Bloomlist - Create a Reading Comprehension Knowledgebook
			- Consolidate all models to use
			- create a process model
			- try it
		- ## Bloom's Revised Taxonomy Notes
			- the model best represents how information is digested and refined.
			- At first, there is a large volume of information.
			- As you progress through the model, the less information but the quality and value increases based on the principles within each step
			- however, what is not demonstrated well is how, through time, each one of these steps is a process within the practice of research itself.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671609075735_0.png)
			- Create another model that demonstrates the flow of time from remember to create
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671609562038_0.png)
			- there are effectively too many steps in the model.
			- consolidate them into three.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671610103630_0.png)
			- visualized in a different model, a few of the the original taxonomy do not really fit in a flow style process.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671610248145_0.png)
			- Analyze and Evaluation should occur throughout the entire process.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671610365669_0.png)
			- Format it to more formalized state
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1671610453837_0.png)
		- ## The Blueprint Notes
			- This model needs to be reformatted to fit within Bloom's revised taxonomy
			- Its also a breakdown into smaller digestible parts

			- Use this new model to create forms/worksheets/knowledgebase assets
		- ## The Periodic Table of Bloom's Digital Taxonomy ACTIVITES Notes
			- this model has way too many verbs that are similar
			- reduce the amount of fucking bullshit

- # LEARNING HOW TO LEARN - How to Succeed in School Without Spending All your Time Studying *by Barbra Oakley, PhD, and Terrence Sejnowski, PhD with Alistair McConville* - 0143132547
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663291929932_0.png)
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663291944930_0.png)
	- ### There are two modes of thinking: FOCUS mode and DIFFUSE mode.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292037668_0.png) ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292043845_0.png)
		- *FOCUS MODE* - The activity of the mind paying close attention to something.
		- *DIFFUSE MODE* - The activity of the mind freely wandering.
		- One can say Focus and Diffuse are synonyms of *Fast* and *Slow* thinking.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292062040_0.png) *kill me*
	- ### Troubleshooting:
		- One has either
			- focused too hard and needs to take a break or
			- haven't focused hard enough.
	- This theory is analogous to R-Brain and L-Brain thinking.
		- EG: Creative thinking vs Analytical thinking.
	- A way to jog the creative mind is to **think primarily with questions, abstractions, and possibilities. (McKee Square)** *Like improv.*
	- A way to jog the analytical mind is to **think primarily in actions, activities, and decisions.**
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292101380_0.png)
	-
	- ## Procrastination is delaying or postponing activities and actions that must be completed.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663291986257_0.png) *wtf?*
		- *Energy is spent worrying instead of execution.*
		- Stress manifests in the brain specifically the *insular cortex.*
			- EG: Pain.
		- Of course this is all in one's head. One must adjust their way of thinking.
		- To remove the pain, one can think of something pleasurable or rewarding.
			- *However, this seems like a shit trick, cause you can do the same thing with working a job.*
			- *Finding meaningfullness and purpose is perhaps the best way to move through the pain.*
				- Use Creative thinking to prime.
					- Why do I need to do this?
						- Do not answer, but continue to question and let the mind wander.
				- Use Anal thinking to lubricate the activity.
					- Remove all friction as slowly as you need.
		- *Active Recall* - is testing the quality of one's study period. The ability to remember key information without reference to books or notes is passing the active recall test.
	- ## When you learn something new, the neural pathways between neurons in the brain  become "stronger."
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292126930_0.png) *its supposed to at least*
		- Stronger neurons result in more efficient electrical explosions, thus one becomes smarter and more creative.
	- ## Sleep is an important factor when learning.
		-
		- Sleep is a key process in the development of **dendritic splines**
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292185679_0.png)
		- **Dendritic splines** - the tendrils that grow from neurons as a result of learning. These tendrils form synapses (connections) to other neurons resulting in a more efficient brain.
			- Dendritic splines emerge during the active process of studying and learning. However, they are not permanent and can often turn into dead end roads.
				- Cramming is the activity one needs to study immediately before a test.
					- Cramming is effective, but it is only temporary. The dendritic splines are active during the process of learning and remain active immediately after while taking the test.
					- However, once the test is over and the learning is not reinforced, the splines remain dormant and the information is lost.
				- Sleep is the most efficient way of growing and reinforcing dendrites.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292369228_0.png)
			- **Robust dendrites are required to achieve the full potential of learning something new**
				- The more neural pathways that are connected, the easier it is to think and actively recall. Thus you become *smarter* in whatever you're studying and sleeping.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292218310_0.png)
				- *__IS IT PEAS OR IS IT INTELLIGENT, DAMMIT, DOCTOR ITS URGENT.__*
	- ## Spaced learning is a method of study that considers the growth of dendritic splines and active recall.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663292409094_0.png)
		- By spacing out the learning of a subject, one can efficiently learn and remember complex topics.
			- Active focus creates dendritic splines.
			- Sleep grows those dendritic splines into dendrites
			- Active recall and reviewing studied topics reinforces those dendritic splines and creates robust neural pathways.
	- ## FIVE STUDY/MEMORY TIPS
		- ### 1) FOCUS
		- ### 2) PRACTICE
		- ### 3) PICTURE
		- ### 4) STORE
		- ### 5) RECALL
	- # **Facts are hard to remember. But Pictures and Memories live forever.**
	- # Whenever starting to study or to learn something new, do a *picture run*
		- Picture Run - Going through the whole book and looking at the pictures. Going through the whole book looking at the chapter titles.
			- It is important to do recon on the activity so it primes your brain to prepare itself to learn.
	- ### Working Memory
		- Only is capable of remembering 4 things at a time in the present moment. It is why we use heuristics, mnemonics, and other methods to hold on to key information relevant in the near future.
			- *When you are not focused, you cannot remember things.*
			- *Focus on the information, and you can remember it.*
		- The brain is capable of effortlessly holding information for about *15 seconds* unless you focus on the information and concentrate on remembering the info.
		- If information needs to be remembered for a longer amount of time, it needs to be coded into long-term memory.
		- I like to think of working memory like *RAM* in a PC.
		- I mean honestly its a pretty 1-to-1 metaphor.
	- ### Long-Term Memory
		- Metaphor used here: A toothpaste toob in a school locker.
			- Toob is like....facts, digits, and database info. *Useless.*
				- It is nearly impossible to remember shit like this, but it is easy to spit out.
			- The school locker is a better representation of how to train long-term memory.
				- Pictures, poems, sayings, heuristics, symbols, models, etc.
				- The brain is able to remember things that are easy to recall and *focus* on.
			- *Long-term memory in regards to storing information works like links in a chain. Information is rememebered as long as it is contextualized to other information, EG: a link in the chain is info, to remember that info, it must be linked to other information.*
				- *Building these chains of information are the basis of long term knowledge and the ability to perform optimally in a complex field. EG: Mastery or Brinksmanship in a chosen field.*
		- ### 5 tips for storing information in Long-term memory
			- *Focus*
			- *Practice*
			- *Picture*
			- *Anchor* - *Attach new info to related ideas already stored in the brain.*
			- *Recall*
			- ## F.P.P.A.R. - *FAPPR* [phonetically]
	- ### RUBBER DUCKY RECALL
		- Explain new concepts to a rubber ducky.
-
- # EFFECTIVE NOTE-TAKING *by Fiona McPherson* - 1927166527
	- ### Note-taking is effectively paraphrasing, organizing, and making sense of information
		- Pimarily a tool to encode information in your memmory.
		- More information can be held by forming information into chunks using verbal and non-vermal memory systems.
		- The amount of information held is dependent by the ability to ignore irrelevant information.
	- ### Selecting proper information can be done with three different methods:
		- highlighting
		- headings
		- summaries
	- ## Highlighting Strategies
		- Do not highlight information you already know
		- Highlighting should be simple. Only *one* color
		- *__Highlighting directs attention, it does not improve recall__*
		- ### Highlighting Selection
			- Highlighting should only be 10% of the text.
			- Select details you want to remember and don't think you will.
			- With dense information, use highlighting as a part of a more robust note taking strategy.
			- *Highlighting should only be used if time is not of  concern*
			- Highlighting is a *directional* signal
	- ## Heading Strategies
		- Headings are a *organizational* signal.
			- Headings emphasize the topics of a text and how they are organized.
			- Headings enable recall of topics.
			- They help readers remember more topics but less about each topic.
	- ## Topic Structure Strategy
		- There are six types of text structures organized in books and other forms of information.
			- *DESCRIPTION* - Clarification of main ideas through examples.
			- *COLLECTION* - A list of acts or elements.
			- *CLASSIFICATION* - Items are Grouped in Classes
			- *SEQUENCE* - A connecting series of events or steps, possibly causally related.
			- *COMPARISON* - Two or more things are compared or contrasted.
			- *PROBLEM* - Discussion of a problem and its solution. A question then the appropriate answer.
			-
		- ### Topic Text Structure
			- Cues you to what is important
			- Helps you ask the right questions
			- signals how the ideas in the text are related
			- provides a structure for notes
			- cues you to the best format for notes.
	- ## Summaries
		- **Topical Summary** - straightforward string of factual statements.
			- Summarize the main points without adding any new information or perspective
		- **Overview** - A topical summary that precedes the text.
		- **Advance Organizer** - Big picture overview that primes the brain to consume the following information.
			- Helps connect new ideas and facts with information already known.
		- ### A good summary is
			- short
			- only the most important information
			- is in your own words.
		- ## Good Summary Checklist
			- What is the main idea of the passage?
			- What is all the important information?
			- Is any of that information not important?
			- Can you write it all down in your own words?
		- ## Effective Summarizing
			- 1) Preview and reflect
			- 2) Read
			- 3) Identify the main idea
			- 4) Restate the main idea in your own words
			- 5) Identify important supporting ideas
			- 6) Restate important supporting ideas in your own words.
	- ## Outlines and Graphic Organizers
		- ### Graphic Oragnizers
			- Require a lot of processing time compared to outlines
			- If the text is short and simple, fuckin useless.
			- Helpful in organizing clusters of information into super-clusters
			- Helpful for showing relationships between clusters
		- ### Outlines
			- Easier and quicker to process than graphic organizers
			- Best for short and simple texts
			- Effective for rote-learning (repetition) facts
			- Useful for showing hierarchical information and relationships between clusters, but not for displaying relationships between clusters.
		- ### Constructing Graphic Organizers
			- Identify the text structure. If it is hierarchical, create an outline not a graphic organizer.
			- What type of graphic organizing format does the information fit in?
				- tree?
				- matrix?
				- flowchart?
				- big cock?
	- ## Multimedia Summaries
		- Multimedia summaries help process information that is both text and image, integrating the two.
		- To perform both text and image processing, we must perform one at a time.
		- ### Text processing:
			- *If I have...* opened a new page, then I will carefully study the title first.
			- *If I have...* finished reading the page, then I will carefully re-read every paragraph.
			- *If I have...* read a paragraph, then I will search for references to previous paragraphs.
		- ### Image Processing:
			- *If I have...* opened a new page, I will carefully study the picture first.
			- *If I am...* looking at a picture, I will search for its central elements with regard to content.
			- *If I have...* looked at a picture, then I will put its central elements into context with each other.
		- ### Text/Image Integration:
			- *If I have read a paragraph...* I will search the picture for the contents described therein.
			- *If I have looked at a picture...* I will search the text for explanations of the examined picture elements.
			- *If I want to move to the next page* then I will carefully study the picture to verify my understanding of the text.
		- ### It is highly probably that there are bad multimedia summaries. It is best to fix them rather than make your own.
		- ### Rules for effective multimedia summaries
			- Be very concise
			- Use minimum text
			- Coordinate words and images.
	- ## THE USEFULNESS OF NOTES
		- Provides a record
		- Focuses Attention
		- Reduces Cognitive Load
		- Organizes Information
		- Helps select what is important
		- Helps one make connections
		- Helps one to review
	- ## Cognitive Style
		- ### Identifying Motivation through 3 approaches to learning
			- Surface
			- Achieving
			- Deep
		- ### Surface level learning
			- One focuses on understanding an author's written words rather than conceiving the author's meaning or purpose.
		- ### Surface level learning requires processing material through several passes, with each pass going deeper every time.
			- 1) Understand and feel comfortable with the words
			- 2) Re-read and look for small units of meaning.
			- 3) Re-read and look for larger macro-chunks of meaning.
		- ### The two fundamental dimensions of cognitive style
			- **Wholist-analytic** - organizing information in wholes or parts
			- **Verbal-Imagery** - representing information in your thoughts verbally or in pictures
		- ## Cognitive Style Classifications
			- ### Wholists
				- Good at seeing things in context
				- may miss important details
				- trouble selecting what is imortant
				- may get confused by a step-by-step approach, particularly when the steps are large
				- need an overview
				- less affected by working memory capacity
			- ### Analytics:
				- good at detail
				- good at seeing similarities and differences
				- Focus on one or two aspects to the exclusion of the other, equally important aspects
				- need help with big picture
				- like a step-by-step approach
				- may find overviews confusing
				- more affected by working memory and capacity
			- ### Imagers:
				- learn best from pictorial presentations.
				- remember visuall descriptive text better than acoustically complex and unfamiliar text
				- recall illustrations more accurately
				- with little knowledge benefit most from seeing text only
				- less affected by working memory capacity
			- ### Verbalizers
				- learn best from text
				- remember complex and unfamiliar text better than visually descriptive text
				- regardless of their amount of knowledge, benefit more from seeing graphics as well as the text
				- more affected by working memory capacity
				-
		- # I believe I am inherently a WHOLIST - VERBALIZER
		- ### Dunn and Dunn Learning Style Model
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1662430571171_0.png)
		- Dunn and Dunn state only about 6 to 15 of the elements are influential.
		- ### Learning Style Model Components I am affected by
			- ### Environmental Elements
				- Some Sound
				- Cool Temperature
				- Informal Setting
			- ### Emotional Elements
				- Persistent focus
				- Low academic motivation
				- nonconformity
				- internally-imposed structure
			- ### Sociological Preferences
				- Working Alone
				- Learning in a Variety of Ways
			- ### Physiological Elements
				- Perceptual Preferences
				- Mobility while Learning
	- ## Choosing the Right Strategy for Learning
		- ### 1) Evaluating the Text
		- ### 2) Articulating Your Goal
		- ### 3) Defining the Retrieval Context
	- ### 1) Evaluating the Text
		- ### Classify the text according to its structure and density:
			- ### Simple
			- ### Complex
			- ### Difficult
