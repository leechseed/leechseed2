		  > Dr. Laurie Betito, clinical psychologist, sex therapist and director of the Pornhub Sexual Wellness Center, notes that “Cartoons are more fantastical than regular porn. They may offer more visual stimulation in terms of movements, angles, colors, and facial expressions. Because it’s not real, it can go further, with less constraints that reality offers. Hentai porn also tends to have more of a storyline and people seem to be more and more drawn to context.”  
		- **Takeaway**
			- hentai enables more fantasy 
			  id:: 62dfb6dd-a6e0-4f32-b60a-cbb21e7be651
			- designed visual/audio stimulation
			- fiction is not bound by the constraints of the reality of irl porn. (EG non-exploitation)
			- storyline, character, and designed cult of personality.

		  > Niki Davis-Fainbloom suggests, “there may be more searches for threesomes this year because so many couples have been isolated with just their partner. When couples spend so much time together, it makes sense that they may begin to think about how to increase excitement in the relationship.”  
		  		    
		  Clinical Sexologist Dr. Stacy Friedman looks to a longer term effect. “Women and couples are finding more of an interest in group sex, such as threesomes, as ways to spice up their relationships. Getting an idea of how things look or work with multiple people can be helpful to bring about conversations in their relationships as to what they like or don’t like if they ever have an opportunity to have group sex...  
		  ...It allows those that don’t want to open up their relationships, a chance to fantasize with each other and enjoy or explore the idea of group sex. Women are becoming more confident in asking for what they want so the idea of exploring this type of activity can be exciting!”  
		- **Takeaway**
		  id:: 62dfb53d-b5e2-4940-ae9c-cbd0a48c8dd4
			- Isolation from the pandemic force couples to seek excitement.
			- Introducing partners opens up the conversation and development of sexuality.
			- Suggestion of, and/or conversation of group sex can be presented as a fantasy to explore imaginatively.

		  > In 2021 we saw a 56% rise in ‘fitness’ related searches. As the world was under lockdown, many celebrities and social media influencers began sharing their favorite at-home fitness routines and this may have driven an increase in fitness searches on Pornhub. Porn involving activities like ‘yoga’, ‘running’, ‘exercise’ and ‘gym’ all saw search gains throughout the year.  
		- **Takeaway**
			- The pandemic incresed the amount of non-working time and opportunity to pursue self-care.
			- Influencers use fitness as a funnel to more adult oriented content
	- #### Swapping

		  id:: 62dfb996-fb89-48ff-88a9-811cec80a846
		  > Our 5th term defining 2021 is ‘swapping’. Once again viewers tossed social distancing to the side and searched for ‘swap’ and ‘swapping’ 170% more than the previous year. ‘Swinger’ and ‘Swinging’ both trended in the spring and summer, resulting in a +127% increase in popularity. Somewhat related terms like ‘Cuckold’ increased +168% in 2021, as well as 93% growth in ‘cheating’ searches.  
		- **Takeaway**
			- The fantasy of shamelessness. Of embracing and pursuing desires that are universally shunned amongst society.

		  > In number six we have ‘challenge’. It seems like every week there’s a new challenge going around social media. Whether you think they’re fun or stupid, there’s no denying that millions of people are up to a challenge. Porn is no different, with dozens of challenges being popular in 2021 including ‘no nut November’, ‘try not to cum’, ‘jerk off challenge’ and ‘buss it’. ‘Challenge’ searches grew 255% in 2021, and more than 500 different terms are routinely searched alongside ‘challenge’.  
		- **Takeaway**
		  id:: 62dfb916-f468-4870-81db-9cc631247cac

	- #### Transgender
	  id:: 62dfba58-5979-4cdc-abeb-ff56cca6a444
		-
		  > According to Dr. Laurie, trans is trending for many different reasons: “Increasingly, marginalized sexuality (outside the vanilla world) is coming out of the shadows. We are talking about sex more, we are more free to explore our sexual fantasies with less judgment attached. Our sexual curiosity is coming out of the closet. Bicuriousity is far more acceptable these days, and even “trendy” among the younger generations. When it comes to Trans individuals, we are now seeing more and more people who are portrayed in mainstream media, thus making trans porn more intriguing, more available and more accepted.”  
		- **Takeaway**
			- Bicuriosity is the norm of younger generations.
			- Isolation and masturbation can introduce a need to push the boundaries of what is stimulating.
			- Something about **traps** can be stimulating.

		  > The 8th term that defined 2021 is ‘goth’ which grew by +283% over the last year. That follows a similar trend in pop culture with goth style and culture making a comeback with the Y and Z generations.  
		- *Takeaway*
			- Categorical identity clique/trends are surging with the rise of social technology.

		  > At number nine on our list is ‘roommate’. Perhaps due to long periods of quarantine, people have been fantasizing about the people they were closest to, which may have caused the 136% increase in roommate related searches, including ‘lesbian roomate’, ‘gay roomate’, ‘straight roomate’ and ‘horny roomate’.

		-
		  > Sex coach and doctor of human sexuality, Dr. Stacy Friedman tells us “The increase in searches of ‘how to’, shows that people are finally feeling more comfortable looking at how to improve their sex lives. Since the discussion of sex has been taboo for so long, relationships have suffered because there aren’t that many places to learn about sex. Since we have had the pandemic, I believe that couples are realizing they need more help in the bedroom so there is more research out there that they can find information from. People want to know how to enjoy their sexuality more.”  
		- **Takeaway**
			- Increased acceptance and consumption of adult content has buffed sexual intelligence in pseudo-society meta.
				- Sexual Ability has surged as a valuable skill path with the surge of content creator/influencer profession pipeline.
			- Isolation/Pandemic causality

	- A key coping behavior is tied to the isolation found within the pandemic.
	- Isolation provides a perceived sense of control over one's environment and stimulation.
	- Once environmental control is established, a common resulting symptom is a distinct lack of stimulation.
	- However, with control comes positive behaviors such as confidence and curiosity.
	- The availability of sexually stimulating content can lead one's behavior to be affected thru tolerance.
	- What once was effectively stimulating may no longer be so.
	- What results is a psychological predisposition towards the pursuit of pseudo-realistic sexual fantasy and non-conventional sexual concepts.
