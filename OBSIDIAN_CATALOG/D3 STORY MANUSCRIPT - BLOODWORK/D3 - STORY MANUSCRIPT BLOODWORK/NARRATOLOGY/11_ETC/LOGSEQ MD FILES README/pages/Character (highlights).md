	- . In his Poetics, Aristotle
	  ranked the six components of dramatic art from top to  
	  bottom in terms of their creative difficulty and importance  
	  to the work as (1) Plot, (2) Character, (3) Meaning, (4)  
	  Dialogue, (5) Music, (6) Spectacle ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqe19n68m5f4dznzv3gke7))  
	- This theory conceives of plot as actions and reactions on
	  the physical and social planes, while it confines character to  
	  thoughts and feelings in the conscious and subconscious  
	  spheres. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqecak33mppt20a0hk6f0y))  
	- Character names a fictitious being who either causes events
	  to happen or reacts when someone or something else  
	  causes them, or both. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqf5rk5kwad5jctwzd1h4x))  
	- Plot names a story’s arrangement of events. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqf8fbkdggw74cbczjhfjb))
	- ough its characters.
	  The term shared by both definitions is event, so let’s  
	  define it with precision: The dictionary definition of an  
	  everyday event is something that happens. In a story,  
	  however, if what happens changes nothing of value, the  
	  event has no meaning. If, for example, a passing breeze  
	  rearranges leaves on a lawn, things change but that event is  
	  meaningless because it’s valueless. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqfkwbj1ssba11tnnjjdm8))  
	- value is defined as a binary of human
	  experience that can change its charge from positive to  
	  negative  
	  or  
	  negative  
	  to  
	  positive:  
	  Life/Death, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqfv7zw9jx5zawxt40dskt))  
	- A storied event, therefore, is a moment of value-charged
	  change in a character’s life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqg8mzgg9g0set9vq0j7qf))

	- Character design: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqh5jp046pwc70pvjdsr9b))
	- Characterization: All observable traits and outer behaviors
	  —the composite of age, gender, race, speech and gestures,  
	  job and home, dress and fashion, attitudes and personality  
	  —in short, the masks or personae a character wears as he  
	  carries out his relationships with other people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqhqfagy81jct83cbvcw2f))  
	- True character: A role’s unseen, inner nature—his
	  deepest motivations and rock-bottom values. When  
	  confronted by life’s greatest pressures, this core reveals  
	  itself in the choices he makes and the actions he takes in  
	  pursuit of his most consuming desires. These decisions and  
	  deeds express his core identity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqht6a6pqwkdtgswdcxjqn))  
	- Therefore, the six key differences between plot-driven
	  and character-driven stories are: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqj1xsxxmp6ea749ab1965))  
	- 1. Causality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqj3t3hym9st704g7qq9wb))
	- 2. Identity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqj9w2089ferft0y9s8kh8))

	- 6. Freedom Versus Fate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqjkx6tyzx8bpa1xb8jkrq))
	- If you’re wondering where your story stands in the Aristotle
	  debate—plot-driven, character-driven, or a balance of the  
	  two—simply list all your scenes and divide their turning  
	  points into those caused by character choice versus those  
	  caused by forces beyond their reach. W ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqm2h457nm0c09hmd3he9g))  
	- Whichever way your
	  telling leans, no one source of causality is more inspirational  
	  than another. Eventually, the way things happen will argue  
	  it out somewhere in the middle of your mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqm4baj71w5qt6axst7mee))  
	- Do writers
	  invent characters or give them birth? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqn6sxang4vedjfnqwjqfm))  
	- Are characters
	  conscious creations or subconscious manifestations? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqn96ftg4v0zq5xk16enar))  
	- Research travels down four roads: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqpbb8jz6w4v6dc41mvhwk))
	- personal, imagined,
	  factual, and actual. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqpd1gkhdnyb5t1gtzz4mr))  
	- 1. Personal Research ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqpfd6tw5zafhaz4as19zg))
	- Your memory collects all the meaningful emotional
	  experiences you have undergone in both reality and fiction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqpjswj3cef1q9swzg76n2))  
	- 2. Imaginative Research ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqpv1ceh30mg1pzyq12xb3))
	- Memory takes whole events from the past and re-creates
	  them in the present. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqpwt7ekpepw9b1sger0g5))  
	- Your
	  imagination uses the power of analogy to invent today’s  
	  wholes out of bits of the past. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqqk5qkwm6k1jq85pbnk4m))

	- oon find that memory and
	  imagination take you only so far. The knowledge you have  
	  at the beginning of a project is rarely enough to finish it. To  
	  that you must add book-bound learning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqr49ashasnrztf7bavjjx))  
	- 4. Grounded Research ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqrcyarmwamsafpeakmfq8))
	- Never finish writing anything until you
	  feel that you have gone deeper into your subject than  
	  anyone who has written about such things before, that you  
	  have become an absolute authority on your characters and  
	  their settings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqrqepkyzm08j95r21zgyj))  
	- Original characters grow out of an original perception of
	  humanity, and so every fine writer develops her personal  
	  theory of what makes people do the things they do in the  
	  ways they do them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqskr4gyw37yk989e8ntsg))  
	- Your personal theory will then flow into your characters,
	  influencing their sense of meaning and purpose, what they  
	  ought to do, what they must never do, what they ought to  
	  strive for or against, what they may hope to build or  
	  destroy, what vision of love and the relationships they work  
	  toward, what social changes they want to make, what  
	  choices and actions they want to take. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqssqatbxj38cdx6hc4jv9))  
	- When humankind began to think in depth about itself, it

	  creeds tend to split into two contradictory points of view on

	- In the mid-twentieth century, anthropologist Joseph

	- Cognitive Science, the counterpoint to Critical Theory, grew
	  out of linguistics, IT, and computer research. In this nature-  
	  based theory, the mind is a biological computer designed by

	- Moral Imagination means a sensitivity to life’s values, an
	  ability to recognize shifting charges (positive versus  
	  negative), shifting levels (conscious versus subconscious),  
	  shifting intensities (subtle versus overt)—the changing  
	  qualities that compel and propel people as they decide and  
	  act (or vacillate and procrastinate) in their efforts to  
	  confront (or evade) conflict. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqx9drxef8vrw9c1at7nzh))

	- All
	  writing  
	  is autobiographical. Every nugget of

	  inspiration from outside yourself finds its way to the page  
	  through you, filtered through your mind, your imagination, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqxt3zfabvx6n4a5ezkczd))  
	- Inspiration can erupt from any of the many realms that
	  surround an author, so picture the storyteller’s universe as  
	  five concentric spheres nested one inside the other: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqydakn2c3bp529cckpqxc))  
	- 1. The outermost shell comprises actuality—time and
	  place, people and things, past and present. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqyg64ex2t4gc0rkrvaafn))  
	- place, people and things, past and present.

page, stage, and screen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqyhafmd2gvdxvrted7nf5))

	- page, stage, and screen.
		3. Within that sphere orbit the storytelling genres with  
their various conventions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqyjqrhv1yt90zzr728kbv))

	- 4. Each story houses a backstory reaching back to the
	  characters’ births, turning points that happen during  
	  the telling, and themes that unite all these events. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqym29bd1hmfxhwsaeygny))  
	- 5. At the epicenter stands the author’s creative self,
	  looking out, in search of inspiration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbqyn690jttd3fxgjk74zd6))

	- subconscious realm ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr0512xgq0d6ks18mm0af9))
	- In the William James view of the private realm, the core
	  self maintains a single identity over a lifetime while  
	  observing and absorbing its many past selves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr1gpxt5b3fm7zbj3xc9ek))  
	- extended self. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr10vssxx0ctectsvdz74k))
	- This protected, sane self contains a set of
	  enduring facilities: willpower, rational thought, and moral  
	  sensibility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr20np3ms4dywvx4te5qxd))  
	- when a character comes under extreme stress
	  due to disasters such as physical injury, sudden poverty,  
	  drug dependency, insanity, senility, terminal illness, and the  
	  like, these derangements attack the core self, causing  
	  overpowering emotions, paralyzed thought, seizures,  
	  hallucinations, amnesia, lapses of consciousness, or splits or  
	  reversals of personality. In a word, a character de-  
	  dimensionalizes. Her identity weakens and she becomes  
	  unmoored, alone, until her essential self eventually  
	  vanishes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr2t96pjzvpkppcv5jac5e))  
	- The core
	  self of certain characters wavers, constantly reinventing  
	  itself as it pushes through life. To express that splintering,  
	  Joyce Carol Oates, in her novel Blonde, fragmented Marilyn  
	  Monroe into numerous selves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr35ycqmmvxx0ycm73w9dq))  
	- Compared to the core self, personal
	  selves are temporary behaviors, easily dropped as an agent  
	  self moves from scene to scene. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr71v0kvfaphtvn7w4x9j9))  
	- All social selves
	  are insincere to a degree, and yet necessary to protect the  
	  core self. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr7ndxa8yc84w9fg6ctv4q))  
	- A character’s selves, both personal and social, are best
	  thought of as sets of performances. Each role has a  
	  particular tone of voice, eye expression, body language, and  
	  nervosity, depending on the identity of the other person and  
	  the quality of power or intimacy between them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr5hjawrz0eq9fp5ngg1wr))  
	- The subconscious self sits in the silent space behind the
	  conscious mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr81mc0em8h6bt5emnf2vg))  
	- Although mute, the subconscious “thinks” far faster than
	  the core self realizes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr8bqqeqkppzm454f4f38w))  
	- The subconscious contains moods and feelings,
	  automatic skills, automatic reactions, unperceived  
	  perceptions, habits, phobias, dreams, memories, implicit  
	  knowledge, and sudden creative insights. Innate desires  
	  arise out of this hidden self—cravings for food, sex, and  
	  survival at all cost, as well as for knowledge, love, and  
	  peace. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbr8wjvc6yk1nz9txqdr8q8))  
	- Because these drives disrupt the conscious mind,
	  they stay out of view; nonetheless, they sway judgments,
