- # types of lit editing
- **Developmental editing** (may also be called 
  structural or content) – looks at the book’s big picture and overall   
  structure in nonfiction or plot and characters in fiction. Developmental  
  editors may assess a book idea, outline, or early draft to tell authors  
  what works and what could be better. The big picture questions need to   
  be answered first before an editor ensures your words are polished and   
  used correctly.  
- **Line editing **(may also be 
  called substantive or stylistic) – goes through each line refining the   
  arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences and   
  smooth-transitioning paragraphs. This helps the book “sound good” by   
  polishing the language used to communicate your story. [Learn more about line editors.](https://kindlepreneur.com/line-editing/)  
- **Copyediting **–
  corrects grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Copyediting also   
  includes correcting commonly confused words (e.g., affect and effect) as  
  well as checking for internal consistency of facts and consistency with  
  capitalization, hyphenation, and numerals. [Learn more about copy editors](https://kindlepreneur.com/copy-editing/).  
- **Proofreading**
  – a final check before publication to find missed typos, missing words,  
  repeated words, spacing and formatting consistency. Proofreading should  
  be the very last level of editing. [We have a comprehensive post on proofreading marks as well.](https://kindlepreneur.com/proofreading-marks/)
