	- # study of Malhari (source anchor song)
		- based on the traditional folk music of the Indian state of Maharashtra and is often classified as a form of Marathi folk music. **Marathi folk music**, also known as **Lokgeet** or **Lavani**, is characterized by its energetic beats, rhythmic patterns, and lively vocals.
		- [Lalati Bhandar - folk fusion dance cover]({{video https://youtu.be/OPTIEaVODE0}})
	- # study of Bloodywood's Gaddaar
		- Bloodywood outright says they're an Indian Folk Metal Band.
		- Diving even further, the percussion sounds inspired by *marathi*
		- Shit is a fucking banger. It holds energy of the vengeful vibe of the final journey of Mass Effect 3
		- [Gaddaar]({{video https://youtu.be/7iKjSCTxke8}})
- # VISUAL STYLE intertext inspiration Run Tha Jules' song in Cyberpunk
	- This shit is sick. For some reason, cyberpunk and the neon aesthetic still hits hard even two years after the release.
	- This music video really illustrates the kinetic, hyperstiumlating, maximal oversaturated nature of cyberpunk.
	- A grotesque display of naked shameless vice.
	- Colors sear your eyelids off
	- the only dark color is black, and its the darkest on the planet.
	- ## Pedestal Camera Frame motif
	- A lot of the action is filmed like a product display from QVC except perverted till its cool af.
		- The subject and action lie at the center of the 3D stage
		- the camera is anchored on sticks running on rails at 180 degree track.
		- In effect, the camera 'orbits' the subject.
		- During these scenes, the camera is locked off with movements being smooth, slow, and intentional.
		- It adds a total designer exhibition vibe to the video, which contrasts well with the psychotic seziure of the rest of the cyberpunk aesthetic.
		- This works well with the Banglenciaga brand aesthetic.

- # Brand Study - Nike
	- [Air Jordan Ones 'Next Chapter'](https://www.nike.com/t/air-jordan-1-next-chapter-mens-shoes-LbZt3q/DV1748-601)
	- Clean website. White primary black logo.  Nothing too crazy
	- You're able to see the focus on design with the shoe
	- high quality photos with clear intention
	- design of the shoe, photo highlights the intricacy of its design
		- material variation
			- in the toe, its one material, like a polished leather leather
			- the transitional areas seem to be a rough leather
			- the distinct printed material used as loops for the upper shoe laces
				- there is a pattern present, as well as intention with faded red quality
				- the pattern is yellow and blue, rgb
				- perhaps to represent a theme of transition
				- the end of a generation, and the beginning of a revolution
				- Upper printed material has a markedly different textural pattern
				- little tiny dots
				- functional, perhaps due to the top two laces are ment to be the tightest
				- that would suggested the dots act as a structural reinforcement
				- the pattern transitions a quarter of the way through the heel back to the original print pattern.
				- the air jordan logo, looks like the old one, not the one with Jordan dunking, splat in the middle of the abrupt side by side transition.
				- The logo itself is not in the middle, but spliced a third of the way from the left between air and jordan
				- the detail of the symbolism is incredible.
				- reinforces the value of the shoe, beyond the surface level grindset hustle considerations
			- the stitching
				- the photo highlights the stitching of the shoe
				- i've never really considered looking at a shoe in this detail, nor have I been drawn to considering it till now
				- there are several types of stitching
					- there's a double parallel type stitching in the toe, the front lace loops, and the heel
						- suggestive of the critical structure of the shoe.
						- these are the stitches that that hold the shoe together
						- it could be an interesting motif to use when performing critical analysis of clothing or shoes
						- double stitching represents the functional form of the product.
						- these stiches and the material it ties together represents the formation of the architecture or bones of the shoe
						- this visible architecture correlates to where the eye is drawn to the shoe
				- the initial viewing of the shoe goes as follows
					- woah - I'm interested. the design and presentation of the shoes follows some form that attracts the eyes.
					- executed with knowledge and purpose
					- other shoe sites like zello, or whatever, present shoes in a way that are not clear.
					- in a way, you don't know if you want these shoes...or these shoes.
					- with this, you know you want a pair, even if you don't like sneakers.
					- single stitches are there to act as
				- bold contrasts make the form of the shoe. makes it classic.
				- but the eye is drawn to what makes the shoe different from the mind's understanding of what jordan's look like
				- its the *patterns* which make the shoe unique.
				- its the intent and execution of the faded pattern which create depth in the design.
		- the 'Next Chapter' shoe represents a clear-headed and respectful understanding of the history of Air Jordans. The visual formic design of the original while also incorporating techniques and motifs of the innovative present.
		- These shoes are not meant to close a chapter or say goodbye, it was a vehicle specifically designed for the present and the past  to take the symbolic trip of transition into the  unknown.
		- Together, when the present understands the past and innovates with their same intentions that built the brand, Nike has a future that is strong, bold, and forever moving forward.
		- color distinction
