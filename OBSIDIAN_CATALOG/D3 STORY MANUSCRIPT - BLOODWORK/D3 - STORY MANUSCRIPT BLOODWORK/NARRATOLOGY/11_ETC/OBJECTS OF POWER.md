# objects of power are items that function as narrative devices to further the narrative




# Yoyo wire weapon 
Like the monowire from cyberpunk + ghost wire Tokyo 

Originally a utility tool used in space to grab things. Subject it to a Ferro current and it can store and expel  substantial heat like an electric stovetop 

# sockets 

Sockett is a an analog bio access connector that provides information on the human it is installed in. 

Basically an xlr cable socket. 
The socket can be used as a fashion and personality statement. The placement, the cover, etc. The meaning of it is kind of lost in the noise. This shit can get crazy. 

What if the apparatus was used to pump "gas" into people from space 

People can get multiple proprietary sockets installed. They can "eat" etc....
The point is, this "socket" can be the x factor in my show.  A great title too. 

Like magic, it is a system of power. But instead of being dicking retarded and mysterious, it's rooted in reality. Curiosity is not
