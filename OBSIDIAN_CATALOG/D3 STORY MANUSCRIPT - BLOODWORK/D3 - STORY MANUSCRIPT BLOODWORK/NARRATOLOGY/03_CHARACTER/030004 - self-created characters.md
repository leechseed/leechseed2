	- ## GPT 4 summary
		- The main character class, termed as 'retch,' 'tramps,' and 'vandals,' is symbolic of the millennial generation. Aged 18-38, they are blamed by both older and younger generations for societal degradation and the handing down of a damaged world. Traumatized by broken promises and societal expectations, their trust is hard to earn, and they tend to cultivate personalities that protect their vulnerabilities while attacking perceived weakness.
		- Their definition of success is oriented towards materialistic achievements used as shields for their personality, and their driving forces are grand acts of revenge, vengeance, and domination. Power dynamics within this group are complex, with authority being held by those commanding others but not necessarily indicating the weakness of subordinates.
		- Each individual harbors an outrageous, nearly impossible dream, often aimed at dismantling the authority blaming them for societal issues or reining in the rebellious youth. There's a moral dichotomy within the class, divided into 'Angels' symbolizing virtue and 'Demons' symbolizing wrath. Their actions are not driven by personal aspirations, but by the state of society around them, with a goal either to penalize society for their unjust ostracism or to prove their judges wrong.
		- Both angels and demons serve as necessary elements in reshaping society, with the former aiming to build a just society from the ashes of the old one, and the latter seeking to purge those deemed responsible for societal decline. However, their differing visions often put them at odds, with demons seeking an apocalypse and angels desiring a rapture. The key question is whether they can reconcile their differences and instigate a true societal revolution.
