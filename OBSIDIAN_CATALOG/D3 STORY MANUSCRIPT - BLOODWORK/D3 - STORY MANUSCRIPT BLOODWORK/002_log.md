We've taken both dramatica and narratology and somewhat combined the two in to a working model that combines both. 

01 - [x] Psychology (theme)
02 [x] (fabula)
03 [x] (character)
04 - [x] Physics (setting)
05 (syuzhet)
06 - [x] Mind (narrator)
07 - (diesis)
08 - [x] Universe (fuzz intertext)
09 (publication)
10 (works)
11 (etc)

The four categories chosen are broad enough to fit within the compleity of dramatica's layered theory. ( I hope )

## 01 - Psychology (theme)
will utilize the entire concept of Bloom's theory of theme as well as the construct provided by narratology. 

Fit these concepts within the dramatica table. 

## 04 - Physics (setting)
will utilize the tabletop models of setting construction. Like Kobold and Sixth World

Keep in mind there will/must be esoteric undefined design choices that will integrate all other forms of narratology and theme. 

## 06 - Mind (narrator)
will utilize a categorization of narrator types taht I will choose. (hopefully 4 in total) that will align with the subcategories of 'Mind.' 

However, I must keep in mind the semantic axies that are built into each sub-category. 

### How will each narrator manifest this conflicting nature? Think of theme. 
- 01 Thru self-doubt and radical empathy? (me)
- 02 manifestation of a alter-conscious (Dr.Jekyll/Mr.Hyde)?
- 03 drug fueled biting coping commentary with the state of reality? (Hunter S. Thompson)
- 04 hyper-focus on the minutia of grand concepts sans emotion? (non-fiction psychosis)

### How will each narrator view, conceptualize, and communicate their perspective of the fabula? 
- 01 focused on the nature of setting, feeling, and sensory concepts. Hypnotic in nature. 
  - There is an author that is totally focused on this. Find them. 
- 02 I like the idea of framing this narrator as a conscious and subconscious semantic axes. 
  - I am often reminded of the doctoral candidate character in Mx86. 
  - His battle between finding a solution for the world...aka the world but at what cost? 
  - Personally, I believe this could be the **main thruline narrator for Bloodwork**
  - As for the first arc, Vanessa is battling the nature of her Vampirism. Her conscious personality of pure-Vanessa, vs. vamp-Vanessa. 
- 03 A mix between the noir private eye true crime with the drug fueled necessity to live in such a shit world from Hunter S. Thompson. 
  - **This is the true narrative voice of the thruline of Riley Rakam**
- 04 - The focus on the hyperminutia and the semantic axes that forms is a self-fulfilling tragedy often found in many genius-type characters found in modern day. 
  - however, as the public, we rarely are able to construct entertaining consequences of this type of life and personality. 
  - When I think of this type of character, I think of Maria from Over Exit Out, Elon Musk of Reality, or the Narrator/Author construct from Dante. 
  - These characters are so mentally on-rails that they have constructed a warped reality which is expressed to an empathetic yet self-aware narrator. 
  - The narrator functions as a the conscious self-aware and common mindset of the focalized 04 character. 
  - This narrator's style endears the reader to the character, however, it also serves as a tragic negation that the focalized 04 character ignores. 
  - Thus, when negative consequences occur, the 04 focalized character understands the truth of situation. However, tragically, the character denies this reality and pushes forward regardless. 
  - **ref Don Quixote**
- ## 08 Universe (fuzz)
- The most derivitive model, I believe. 
- However, that isn't without reason. Using models found in tabletop gaming specifically RPGs will illeviate the most pressing concern with extended fabula in a compelx universe: contextuality, continuity, and believability. 
- Primarily, the following texts will be referenced and have already been processed (not really).
  - Kobold
  - Sixth World
  - One other I can't remember 
- A precursor to these decisions is the concept of **Genre** and **Medium** that must be considered sa well. 
- Consider that these two concepts will not be entirely bound to 08. Simply because each convention has multiple concepts that exist in other narratological concepts. 

## Other categories 

The other 7 uncategorized topics of narratology are esoteric design choices that can exist outside of the dramatica 'table of story' 

### 03 and 02
03 Character, for example, exists in the overall theory of dramatica as 'throughlines'. These throughlines are then considered when making choices forward the 02 fabula. 

## 05 (syuzhet)
Don't know much about how this will form in Dramatica, but I have an idea. 

Once the output of the prime fabula is constructed thru the Dramatica program, I will use the concepts of **medium**, whatever I will be publishing the work in, in constructing an appropriate **syuzhet**

So, for example, I for a book I will consider the following because it provides a sense of model and construction. 
  - Coffee Break Screenwriter
  - A book about the plot patterns
  - One that considers the modern concepts of plotting in literature.

## 07 (diesis)
Consider books that (I know I have these)
- studies dialgoue 
- studies youth cultures 
- studies communication
- studies classes and communications 

## 09 (publication)
- the complex topic of actually getting the work published and the non-narratology focused concepts not associated with the creation of the narratology or fabula. 

## 10 and 11 (works and etc)
10 is a repository for completed projects
11 is a repository for studied topics that do not have a certain category associated with yet.
