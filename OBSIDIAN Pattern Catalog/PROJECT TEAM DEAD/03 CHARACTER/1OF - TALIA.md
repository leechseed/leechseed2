# The psychology workbook for writers:
## INTRODUCTION
In this book, I aim to outline several counselling and psychological theories with a view to how they help writers. These theories help therapists make sense of 
	**- personality**
	**- human interaction**
	**- conflict**
	**- self-sabotage and more.** 
**For your characters to be realistic, they need to contain these attributes – just like real people do.** 

Each chapter will outline a theory or concept as simply as possible. I’ll provide examples from literature and movies to demonstrate what is being talked about and two worksheets with questions to help you apply the theory to your own work – one to help build your characters and one to help build your story. 

“But I already know my characters and story!” you may say. Great. This will help you drill down into what really makes them tick and add layers to them. It will also help you bring out the elements that you know in new and interesting ways to show your readers. 

Even writers with a strong understanding of human nature sometimes find it a challenge to apply that understanding to their writing. By doing this in a conscious process, you will gradually integrate it into your instinctive writing behavior. 

The difference between writers and therapists, of course, is that therapists are working to help clients resolve their issues and writers are creating issues for their characters! This is how they bring conflict into the story. 

This book is NOT intended as a self-help book or for therapeutic use. It will condense several years of training into a few pages designed to be useful for a writer, not a therapist. The focus here will be on creating trouble, not fixing it. To summarize: This is for your CHARAC TERS, not your friends and family!! 

Use as much or as little as you are comfortable with. Most therapists settle on a couple of favorite approaches in the way they work and that’s okay for writers too. Some theories cover the same ground but a different path so find the one that suits you best. Use what makes sense to you and throw away the rest. 
## Theory 01 - BLAME THE PARENTS
**The Theory**
**“Tell me about your mother”** said in a Sigmund Freud accent, this is the second most clichéd quote from therapists. (Beaten only by “And how does that make you feel?”) 
Psychology has a bit of a reputation for blaming parents for things. It’s a little unfair, but there’s some truth to it. Human beings learn much of their understanding of the world and how it works well before their brains are developed enough to objectively evaluate what they’re learning. That means the influences of our early years have a huge impact on how we behave later in life. Parents and other authority figures, both intentionally and unintentionally , contribute hugely significant messages to our developing brains. 

So while a therapist will be quick to point out that it’s not actually about blame, but about identifying the root cause of an issue so the adult self can assess those early messages and beliefs with more rational logic, as a writer, it’s important for us to understand the kinds of early messages our characters were given so that we understand how they operate in the “now” of the story we’re telling. 

So what kinds of messages are there? The counselling theory known as Transactional Analysis has handily split these into two types: Injunctions and Drivers (listed in TA Today, Ian Stewart, Vann Joines). 

==Injunctions== are the “Don’t” messages. On a subconscious level, they tell your character that they’re not an okay person because they’re not allowed to do or be these particular things. These messages are rarely given intentionally but usually picked up through behavioral cues and absorbed into the subconscious. They’re a great source of insecurity for a character. 

**Injunctions include:**
	**- Don’t feel**
		- E.g. Don’t cry. Don’t have emotions or keep them to yourself if you do. 
	**- Don’t belong** 
		- E.g. Putting down roots is a bad idea. You’re a loner and you don’t belong anywhere.
	**- Don’t be you** 
		- E.g. Who you are isn’t good enough and is wrong. You should be more sporty/academic/quiet/straight. You should be like your brother. 
	**- Don’t think** 
		- E.g. Boys don’t like smart girls. If I want your opinion I’ll ask for it. Smarty-pants.
	**- Don’t exist** 
		- E.g. My life was great before I had kids. I had to give up my career to have you. 
	**- Don’t be close** 
		- E.g. You shouldn’t get attached. People hurt you or you’ll hurt them. 
	**-Don’t grow up** 
		- E.g. Children are cute, it’s a pity they have to turn into teenagers. 
	**- Don’t be important** 
		- E.g. Stop trying to get attention. 
	**- Don’t be well** 
		- E.g. I feel good when I’m looking after you.
	**- Don’t make it**
		- E.g. Nobody in this family does anything worthwhile. Don’t get too big for your boots. 
	**- Don’t be a child**
		- E.g. You need to be the adult and look after me. 

==Drivers==, on the other hand, are more positive messages and often given intentionally. They are the messages that drive us to achieve and tell us we are okay as long as we follow their advice. These messages can become problematic if they are absolutes. This can mean we only feel good about ourselves as long as we can fulfil the Drivers’ command. 

**Drivers include:** 
	**- Try hard** 
	**- Hurry up** 
	**- Please others** 
	**- Be perfect** 
	**- Be strong** 

Internal conflict in a character can be built by selecting a combination of injunctions and drivers that function as a kind of psychological tug of war within the character as they try to meet the requirements of the messages in order to feel good about themselves. E.g. “I shouldn't be important but it’s okay as long as I’m perfect.” Or, “I’ll only belong and have people care about me if I do what I can to please others.” Or, “I shouldn’t have feelings and I do, so I have to hide them and appear to be strong so as to be accepted.” 

Part of the character ’s journey is to learn about him or herself in the course of the story. Creating an internal conflict to wrestle with keeps the character interesting to the reader. They may or may not resolve the conflict. In therapy, the objective is to help a client find a way to give themselves permission to let go or mitigate these messages in healthy ways. Your character could do this through their experiences in the story or they may not. But their struggle with the messages and their implications for their adult life and behavior will make for an engaging read.

*Example* 
In the Disney movie Frozen, Princess Elsa picks up very strong messages from her parents after an accident involving her ice magic. She receives the injunctions Don’t be you, Don’t be close, Don’t feel, and Don’t belong. In order to feel good about herself, she also must adhere to the driver messages of Be perfect and Please others. These messages come from the adults’ fears and tell her to hide her powers and who she is, staying in control always or else she could do serious harm to her loved ones and her country . It is not until Elsa gives herself permission to let go of some of these messages that she can truly be herself, gain control of her life and her powers, and protect the ones she loves. This internal story arc for the character is a huge part of what makes the movie resonate with the audience.

##### AI Example Answer
"I'm afraid of your anger" is closely related to the 'Don't Be Angry' injunction in Transactional Analysis. This injunction restricts the individual from expressing their anger and may also lead them to fear the anger of others. It is likely that the individual has been brought up in an environment where anger, whether their own or that of others, is seen as dangerous or unacceptable. They may feel uncomfortable or threatened when confronted with this emotion, either because they've been taught to suppress it, or because they've witnessed or experienced adverse outcomes when anger was expressed.

1. "Don't be so emotional. It's not becoming." - This is related to the 'Be Strong' driver. The person feels they must always be in control of their emotions, and showing feelings or vulnerability is perceived as weakness.
    
2. "We don't talk about our feelings in this family." - This is closely tied to the 'Don't Feel' injunction, where expressing emotions, particularly negative ones, is discouraged or not accepted.
    
3. "It's not polite to express your anger or discontent." - This can be seen as an interaction of the 'Please Others' driver and the 'Don't Be Angry' injunction. The individual is encouraged to avoid behaviors (like showing anger) that might displease others.

#### *Which of the drivers/injunctions do these messages relate to?*

##### AI Example Answer
Driver - 
- **"Be Strong"** - A need to always appear tough, or unaffected by things that would upset others.
Injunction - 
- **"Don't Feel"** - A prohibition against expressing emotions.

#### *How were these childhood messages delivered? What events occurred? What memories does the character have that relate?*
##### AI Example Answer
1. "Don't be so emotional. It's not becoming." - Alex recalls countless instances when they were reprimanded for showing too much emotion, whether it was excitement over a new toy or sadness about a lost pet. A memorable event was when Alex broke down in tears after losing a school competition, only to be met with disapproving glares from their parents instead of comfort.
    
2. "We don't talk about our feelings in this family." - Family dinners were always about discussing the day's events, achievements, or sometimes general knowledge topics. Whenever Alex tried to talk about feeling bullied in school or their fear of the dark, the conversation was quickly shut down or changed to something else. Alex distinctly remembers a time when their grandmother passed away. Everyone in the family was sad but no one talked about it or expressed their grief openly.
    
3. "It's not polite to express your anger or discontent." - Whenever Alex got angry or expressed dissatisfaction, they were immediately scolded, or even punished. An impactful memory for Alex was when they had a disagreement with their sibling and expressed their anger. Their parents intervened immediately, not to mediate, but to reprimand Alex for their 'rude' display of anger.


"I'm afraid of your anger" - One particularly powerful memory that contributed to this feeling was when Talia accidentally broke a valuable family heirloom. Their father's intense outburst of anger, although not directed violently towards Alex, was terrifying. From that day onwards, any signs of anger from others would instill fear in Alex.

#### *What beliefs do they have now as a result of each message?*
##### AI Example Answer
Each of the childhood messages internalized by the character, Alex, would likely have resulted in specific beliefs they hold in adulthood. Here's a potential breakdown:

1. "Don't be so emotional. It's not becoming." - As a result of this message, Alex may have developed the belief that emotions are a sign of weakness, and showing emotion leads to disapproval or rejection. They may feel the need to always maintain composure and may struggle to connect with their own feelings or express them openly.
    
2. "We don't talk about our feelings in this family." - This message could have led Alex to believe that feelings are something to be ashamed of or hidden. They may struggle to articulate their emotions, even to themselves, and find emotional conversations or situations uncomfortable.
    
3. "It's not polite to express your anger or discontent." - This message would likely have ingrained a belief in Alex that anger is bad or destructive. They may have difficulty expressing dissatisfaction or standing up for themselves for fear of causing conflict or displeasing others.
    

"I'm afraid of your anger" - As a result of this experience, Alex likely believes that anger from others is threatening and fears confrontation. They may avoid conflict at all costs and struggle to assert themselves in situations where their wants or needs are at odds with others.

All these beliefs can have significant impacts on Alex's interactions, relationships, self-esteem, and emotional well-being. By identifying and addressing these beliefs, Alex could work towards healthier ways of expressing and dealing with emotions.

#### *What behaviors do they have as a result of those messages and beliefs?*
##### AI Example Answer
The internalized messages and subsequent beliefs can influence Alex's behaviors in several ways:

1. "Don't be so emotional. It's not becoming." - Because of this message, Alex might suppress their emotions, often appearing composed or detached. They may have a hard time showing excitement or sorrow openly, even in situations where such reactions are expected or normal.
    
2. "We don't talk about our feelings in this family." - As a result, Alex might avoid conversations or situations involving emotions. They could struggle with understanding their own feelings and may come off as emotionally distant or unresponsive to others' emotions.
    
3. "It's not polite to express your anger or discontent." - Due to this belief, Alex could often acquiesce to avoid conflict, even if they're unhappy or uncomfortable with a situation. They might struggle to say "no" or express their displeasure, often going along with others to maintain peace.
    

"I'm afraid of your anger" - Fear of others' anger may cause Alex to avoid confrontation and conflict. They might become anxious or stressed in situations where anger could arise, and they could frequently make efforts to please or appease others to avoid inciting anger.

These behaviors could impact Alex's personal and professional relationships, as well as their overall mental health. Recognizing these patterns is the first step towards changing them and developing healthier emotional and behavioral responses.

#### *How do they adapt when those messages are challenged?*
##### AI Example Answer
When the internalized messages and beliefs are challenged, Alex's reactions can depend on their coping mechanisms, self-awareness, and readiness for change. Here are some possible scenarios:

1. "Don't be so emotional. It's not becoming." - If someone encourages Alex to express their emotions or points out their emotional detachment, Alex might initially feel uncomfortable or defensive. They might either withdraw further into emotional suppression or slowly start exploring their emotions, depending on their openness to change.
    
2. "We don't talk about our feelings in this family." - When faced with a situation where emotional dialogue is necessary or beneficial, such as in a therapy session or intimate relationship, Alex might feel anxious or resistant. However, with consistent support and understanding from others, they may gradually feel more comfortable discussing feelings.
    
3. "It's not polite to express your anger or discontent." - If someone encourages Alex to stand up for themselves or express their dissatisfaction, Alex might feel conflicted and uneasy. They might initially over-compensate by being overly agreeable, or conversely, they may test the waters by expressing their discontent in small, safe ways.
    

"I'm afraid of your anger" - When confronted with anger or encouraged not to fear it, Alex might feel threatened or anxious. They might react by further avoiding potential conflict, or with reassurance and practice, they may start developing healthier ways of managing and responding to anger.

In general, challenging these deeply ingrained messages and beliefs can initially induce fear, confusion, and resistance in Alex. However, with supportive relationships, therapy, or personal resilience, Alex can start recognizing the limiting nature of these messages and begin adapting their reactions and behaviors towards healthier alternatives.

#### *How do these messages contradict each other and what internal conflicts are set up as a result?*
##### AI Example Answer
Let's analyze how these messages might contradict each other and set up internal conflicts within Alex:

1. "Don't be so emotional. It's not becoming." vs. "I'm afraid of your anger." - On one hand, Alex has been taught to suppress their emotions, but on the other hand, they fear anger, an emotion, in others. This might lead to an internal conflict where Alex struggles to navigate their emotional landscape. They might grapple with understanding the distinction between controlling their emotions and fearing them.
    
2. "We don't talk about our feelings in this family." vs. "It's not polite to express your anger or discontent." - Both messages discourage the expression of emotions, but the latter specifically addresses anger and discontent. This might cause Alex to struggle with understanding which emotions are 'acceptable' and which are not, causing them to overall suppress all emotional expression, leading to emotional confusion and potential distress.
    
3. "It's not polite to express your anger or discontent." vs. "I'm afraid of your anger." - While both messages revolve around the theme of anger, one message instructs Alex not to express their own anger, and the other instills fear of others' anger. This could create a difficult dynamic where Alex is not only uncomfortable expressing their own anger but also fears the possible anger of others, leading to high anxiety and potential avoidance in situations of conflict.
    

These internal contradictions and conflicts can make it difficult for Alex to process emotions and navigate interpersonal relationships, as they could constantly be torn between these conflicting beliefs. They might struggle with understanding the appropriateness of expressing emotions, which can lead to heightened stress, anxiety, and confusion, affecting their overall mental well-being.

### BUILD THE STORY

#### *How can the events which delivered the messages be incorporated into or impact on the current story?*
##### AI Example Answer
The events that delivered these messages can be brought into the current storyline in a few ways, both directly and indirectly. They can influence the character's actions, reactions, relationships, and internal struggles. Here are some possibilities:

1. Flashbacks: Parts of the narrative can involve flashbacks to these pivotal events from Alex's childhood. These could be triggered by present-day events that echo past experiences. For example, a broken dish in a restaurant could trigger a memory of the time when Alex broke the family heirloom.
    
2. Character relationships: The patterns of behavior Alex learned from these messages can shape their relationships with other characters. For example, Alex may struggle to express emotions, leading to misunderstandings or tension in relationships. Alex might go to great lengths to avoid potential conflict, leading to instances of them not standing up for themselves or their friends.
    
3. Emotional struggles: Internal conflicts and struggles born from these contradictory messages can form a significant part of Alex's character arc. For instance, Alex's struggle to reconcile their fear of anger and their inability to express discontent could result in key emotional turning points in the story.
    
4. Growth and change: The storyline could involve Alex beginning to recognize and challenge these internalized messages. This might come through interactions with other characters, therapy, or personal reflection. For instance, a new friend or romantic partner who is very open about their feelings might prompt Alex to start questioning their beliefs around emotional expression.
    
5. Plot points: These messages could also directly influence the plot. For instance, Alex's avoidance of conflict and desire to appease could lead them into tricky situations – they could end up agreeing to a risky plan to avoid confrontation.
    

By incorporating these events and their impacts, the narrative can provide a deeper understanding of Alex's character, create emotional resonance, and set the stage for potential character growth.

#### *What events in the story challenge the messages and subsequent beliefs?*
##### AI Example Answer
Without specific details about your story, I'll provide general examples of how story events might challenge Alex's internalized messages and beliefs. Remember, the specific events will depend on your story's setting, plot, and other characters:

1. Emotional Expression: A close friend or love interest could express emotions freely and without shame, challenging Alex's belief that "Don't be so emotional. It's not becoming." Seeing someone they respect and care for handling emotions openly could make Alex start questioning their own beliefs and behaviors.
    
2. Confrontation of Feelings: Alex could be involved in a situation where they are forced to confront their emotions, such as a therapy session or an emotional crisis (like a death, breakup, or job loss). This challenges the message "We don't talk about our feelings in this family."
    
3. Assertion of Discontent: There might be a situation where Alex is pushed to their limit and needs to express their discontent or anger. This could happen if someone they care about is threatened or treated unfairly, challenging the belief that "It's not polite to express your anger or discontent."
    
4. Handling Anger: Alex might encounter someone who expresses anger in a healthy and constructive way, which challenges their fear instilled by the message "I'm afraid of your anger." Alternatively, they may be forced to deal with someone's anger directly, such as a boss or a partner, and realize that it's not something to fear.
    
5. Personal Development: Alex may come across self-help books, attend personal development workshops, or have deep conversations with insightful friends, which challenge their overall belief system and encourage self-reflection.
    

These events can serve as catalysts for Alex's personal growth and emotional development, prompting them to revisit their internalized messages and question their longstanding beliefs.

#### *Who are the other characters in the story who challenge those messages/beliefs and how?*

##### AI Example Answer 
Again, without specific details about your story, I'll provide general examples of how certain character types might challenge Alex's beliefs:

1. **A Therapist or Counselor**: This professional could challenge Alex's ideas about emotional suppression and provide them with healthier coping strategies. They might create a safe space for Alex to explore their emotions and encourage them to confront and express their feelings.
    
2. **A Best Friend**: This character could challenge Alex's beliefs by being their emotional mirror, reflecting their suppressed emotions. They might be more emotionally open and encourage Alex to share their feelings, indirectly challenging the idea that "We don't talk about our feelings in this family."
    
3. **A Romantic Partner**: This person could challenge Alex's reluctance to express discontent or anger. They might encourage healthy discussions around disagreements, helping Alex realize that expressing discontent doesn't necessarily lead to destructive conflict.
    
4. **A Mentor**: This could be someone at work or in another context who models healthy emotional expression, including anger. Seeing this person handling their anger in a constructive manner might challenge Alex's belief that anger is something to fear.
    
5. **An Antagonist**: This character could bring about situations that force Alex to confront their fears and challenge their beliefs. For instance, they might frequently express anger towards Alex, putting them in a situation where they must face their fear and possibly learn to stand up for themselves.
    

These characters can all play vital roles in Alex's journey of self-discovery and emotional growth, each challenging Alex's beliefs in their own unique ways. However, the precise characters and their actions will depend on the context and plot of your story.

#### *How do the conflicting messages/beliefs of each character cause conflict in their relationship?*
##### AI Example Answer
The internalized messages and beliefs of each character can result in various conflicts within their relationships. Below are examples of potential conflicts based on the types of characters mentioned earlier:

1. **Alex and the Therapist/Counselor**: Alex might initially resist the therapist's encouragement to express their emotions. This resistance can lead to tension in their sessions and slow progress in therapy, potentially causing frustration for both parties.
    
2. **Alex and the Best Friend**: The friend's emotional openness might make Alex uncomfortable, leading to misunderstandings or perceived pressure. Alex might withdraw or avoid certain conversations, leading to tensions or disagreements in their friendship.
    
3. **Alex and the Romantic Partner**: The partner's encouragement for Alex to express discontent could lead to discomfort and avoidance from Alex, leading to unresolved issues or one-sided decisions in the relationship. Alex's fear of the partner's anger might also prevent them from standing up for themselves or fully expressing their needs and desires.
    
4. **Alex and the Mentor**: Alex might initially perceive the mentor's expression of anger as threatening, leading to anxiety or fear. This could create a barrier in their relationship, making it hard for Alex to learn from or be guided by the mentor.
    
5. **Alex and the Antagonist**: The antagonist's frequent anger might intensify Alex's fear and avoidance, leading to an antagonistic relationship characterized by fear and power imbalance. Alex's inability to assert themselves might further empower the antagonist, escalating the conflict.
    

These potential conflicts can add layers of complexity to the character relationships, making the story more engaging. They can also serve as plot devices to drive character growth and change. It's important to remember, though, that how these conflicts play out will depend on the unique dynamics between your characters.

#### *What changes need to happen in the character for the beliefs related to their childhood messages to change? What events could precipitate this?*
##### AI Example Answer
Changing deep-seated beliefs related to childhood messages is often a gradual process involving several key steps:

1. **Recognition**: Alex first needs to recognize that their current beliefs are rooted in childhood messages that may not be helpful or healthy. A catalyst for this might be reading a book that resonates with them, a comment from a close friend, or a particularly emotional event that highlights their patterns of emotional suppression or avoidance.
    
2. **Understanding**: Alex must develop an understanding of how these messages have impacted their beliefs and behaviors. This might happen through therapy, deep self-reflection, or conversations with insightful friends.
    
3. **Challenging the beliefs**: Alex then needs to start questioning these beliefs. They might begin to realize that expressing emotions isn't a sign of weakness, but a healthy part of human experience. A significant confrontation or dispute could act as a precipitating event, pushing Alex to reassess their reactions and behaviors.
    
4. **Experimentation**: Alex might start testing new ways of handling emotions and conflicts. This could begin on a small scale, like sharing a personal feeling with a friend, or expressing discontent about a minor issue.
    
5. **Adoption of new beliefs**: Over time, and with positive experiences from their experiments, Alex could begin replacing the old beliefs with healthier ones. They might come to realize that expressing anger or discontent is necessary for maintaining balanced relationships and for their own emotional health.
    
6. **Consolidation**: Finally, Alex needs to reinforce these new beliefs through repeated positive experiences. Over time, these new beliefs can become more natural and automatic, replacing the old ones entirely.
    

This journey will likely involve moments of backsliding and self-doubt, and progress might be slow. But with determination, self-compassion, and the right support, Alex can move past their childhood messages and develop healthier emotional habits.

## Theory 02 - FLIP THE SCRIPT
**The Theory** 
Once a person (or character) has absorbed messages from their early development, it is up to them to decide how to interpret those messages and what they will mean for their own individual world view and understanding of life, people, and the way the universe works.

In Transactional Analysis, this is called life scripting. The decisions that are made about the world get locked into a storyline in a person’s mind and are often very difficult to shift. People then behave according to their script – often ignoring the events of the real world that don’t support the scripted beliefs. 

Studies have shown that a person’s expectations shape what they see and remember about the world around them. People who expect to be lucky see and remember opportunities that reinforce the belief in their luck. People who expect to be unlucky do the same. 

Essentially, how we behave and react to the world is often less about what is actually happening than it is about what we already believe. If I think “the world is out to get me” then I perceive the checkout operator who short-changes me or the driver who stops a little too close to the pedestrian crossing as being deliberate attacks. As a result, I might react aggressively. 

If, however , I believe I live a happy, charmed life, then I will react completely differently to those events and be much more likely to write them off as insignificant accidents that have little or nothing to do with me. 

With this in mind, how our characters react to the events of the story will have a lot to do with their internal life script and beliefs about the world. A writer needs to have an awareness of what the character’s life script and belief systems are – and find a way to communicate them to the reader without info dumping - to make the character believable. (Remember the writer’s mantra: Show, don’t tell.) 

These life scripts often fall into similar categories or patterns. The script themes put forward in the book TA Today, by Ian Stewart and Vann Joines include:

**Life Scripts include:** 
	- **Until** – the idea that something good can’t happen until something less good has happened. 
			- E.g. “I can’t have dessert until I’ve eaten my vegetables” or, on a grander scale, “I can’t be successful until I’ve paid my dues.” Or perhaps, “I can’t go travelling until after I retire.” 
	- **After** – the idea that any enjoyable thing experienced now will have to be paid for afterward. 
			- E.g. “I’m enjoying this walk but I’ll be sore tomorrow.” The person engaged in this script type has trouble being happy because no matter how enjoyable the moment is, they believe they will suffer for it afterward. 
	- **Never** – the idea that the person will never get what they desire. 
			- E.g. “I’ll never meet the right person for a lasting relationship.” This script type prevents a person from taking the steps they need to achieve their goal because they do not believe the outcome is possible. 
	- **Always** – the idea that you will always get the same result. “
		- E.g. Why does this always happen to me?” This person sticks with a job or relationship that isn’t working and complains about it without doing anything to make a change. Or they change to another job or relationship that is exactly the same as the old one and wonder why the outcome is also the same. 
	- **Almost** – the idea that one’s goal is never quite achieved. 
		- E.g. This person might sabotage themselves at the point of almost succeeding or they might simply change the goalposts when they arrive at their original goal, never feeling like they’ve truly “made it.” 
	- **Open ended** – the idea that they won’t know what to do with themselves after a certain point in time. 
		- E.g. “I’ll be great to be retired...but then what?” 

Think about how you can adapt some of these internal script ideas to fit your character and his or her background. The script needs to have a logic to it – even if that logic only makes sense in the character ’s own mind. Often these scripts don’t make sense to an adult perspective because they were set down in our subconscious as children. Part of your character's journey could be to challenge their script beliefs – thus creating internal conflict and generating an interesting personal dilemma for the character. 

Other characters will have different internal scripts and different ways of seeing the world and each other. This creates external conflict within the story. Think about giving major characters conflicting life scripts to keep things interesting and have them challenge each other. 

A character may have to confront the constraints of his or her life script during the course of the story. This could be a pivotal moment for the character’s development and for the plot. 

Narrative therapy takes a similar view on this but looks at it slightly differently. The view of the narrative therapist is that people tell themselves stories about the world, the people in it, and about themselves. There are many different stories that can be told from the same events, depending on what is focused on. Again, how we perceive the world and behave in reaction to it is more about the story we are telling ourselves than it is about the actual events of reality. 

By retelling a particular story and highlighting the evidence that supports it, I strengthen that story. For example, a person can tell themselves the story that they are always unlucky in love. They repeat this to themselves, and maybe to friends, and they point to relationship break ups or disappointments to support this particular story. 

The same person could, if they chose, to tell a different story – one in which they had a good relationship experience. This alternative story might require more effort because it has been told less often and the evidence to support it is less familiar . However , by seeking out the evidence – that is, remembering events that support the notion that they have had good relationships – and retelling this new story to themselves and others, they strengthen it and thus begin to see themselves and the world differently. 

You can see that a character who tells himself the first story may be very hesitant to commit to a relationship because he expects it to fail. The same character who focusses on the second internal story will be braver in relationships. The results in that character ’s life will be very different because he has behaved differently, because he believes differently, because he told himself a different story about his life and what to expect

Again, the different stories set up an internal combat in the character , giving them a strong personal dilemma to deal with and a lesson to learn. The character needs to resolve the conflict and figure out which story to believe – or whether there is another story that suits him better. 

His personal story about being unlucky in love may make him view a female character who is a potential love interest in a negative way and this could conflict with her own internal story about herself. 

Another character may have an internal story or belief that money is corrupting. As a result they dislike rich people, and have bad saving habits. These resulting behaviors may be completely subconscious and the character doesn’t fully understand why they feel that way. 

Think about the internal stories your characters tell about themselves, about others, about how their lives will play out, and about the world. 

**Examples** 
In the fairy-tale story of Cinderella, we see a version of the Until script at work. Cinderella’ s life is a miserable one and, in theory, she could take action to change this – she could leave home, attempt to wrest control of her family holdings from her stepmother, get another job – but she doesn’t. Cinderella has a life script that says things cannot improve for her until she has somehow suffered enough and is rescued. So she waits and eventually her life changes, not from something she does herself, but from the actions of her fairy godmother and the prince. 

In the television series, Game of Thrones, adapted from George R. R. Martin’s book series, A Song of Fire and Ice , we can see another script at work in Tyrion Lannister , particularly early in the series. Tyrion has, through a series of very strong childhood messages, developed the life script of Never. He believes he will never gain what he truly wants – the acceptance and love of his father. As a result, he refuses to try and spends his time (and money) on alcohol and brothels. It is when he begins to change his desire and aim to please someone more worthy than his father, that he manages to let go of this script and achieve moments of greatness.

## Theory 03 - PIECES OF ME

**The Theory** 
Another way of looking at human personality that can be useful when developing characters is Systemic Theory. This is essentially the “No man is an island” philosophy. The concept behind this approach is that we are all part of a greater bio-psycho-social system and how we behave, in some degree, connected to the people and world around us. We impact others and they impact us. 

We can see how this concept works easily in the world around us. As individuals, our behavior accumulates to create social norms. Societal behavior impacts on the environment in terms of pollution, construction, destruction of habitats, etc. And in turn, those environmental changes impact us on a biological level via our food, climate, etc. I.e. we are all part of a global system, affected by and affecting all other parts. 

A person’s family, community , gender, etc are all individual systems that are a part of the whole and each impact on how that person behaves. For therapists, this means that the best chance of success in helping someone change their behavior is to engage as many parts of the system as possible – other family members, support people, etc. I’ll talk more about this in the section entitled *There’s no place like home (with the family).* 

The same interrelated system model can be applied to our internal workings. Using this point of view, a person can be seen to be a system of many interacting parts of themselves. These parts can often behave in contradictory ways, resulting in the individual experiencing confusion and behavior they do not like in themselves. 

For example, a businessman who has to make a presentation to his colleagues may have a part of himself that finds public speaking scary because of the threat of embarrassment, and another part that is good at research and is confident that he is well prepared for giving the speech. Still another part may know that the speech is important for advancing his career, and one that finds his boss intimidating. There may be a part that logically knows there’s no physical risk involved in delivering a speech but another part could be fearful that the symptoms of anxiety either are or could lead to a heart attack. There could also be a sneaky part of himself who can see how he might manipulate one of his colleagues into doing it for him or fake an illness and a more moral part that wants to live a life of integrity. 

How he reacts when faced with this stressful situation will depend on which of these parts manages to take over the driving seat. Some of the parts may group together to achieve what they think is the best goal. Because each part is only a fraction of the whole person, it is unable to see the bigger picture and may engage in behavior that advances the small goal but does more harm to the whole person as a result. 

If the scared and sneaky parts get control, he may avoid the speech but do damage to his career as a result and maybe even lose his job if he is caught. If the confident and logical parts take control he will do well. The scared and anxious parts working together could produce a panic attack. 

A therapist’ s job is to help the person acknowledge these parts and accept that they all have a positive intention but not the full capacity for making good choices that the whole person has. By choosing to access certain parts of himself while soothing the fears of other parts, he can become more in control. 

For the writer, this presents an opportunity to give the character a pivotal moment in their development. The events of the plot require the character to dig deep, access and strengthen parts of themselves they had previously ignored or been unaware of, and behave in a new way to resolve the crisis. The character grows as a result and learns that he or she can be brave, strong, clever, etc. 

This is also a really good way for a writer to develop a good understanding of the character ’s flaws – particularly for the villains. Nobody truly has the intention of being evil. A realistic villain has motives that are understandable and relatable and they feel justified in what they do. This means there are parts of the villain that may take control from time to time and have their own motivations/logic that are, in some way, for the best in terms of the villain. They may want to be loved, or to be safe, or to prevent the loss of something they care about – and the part of them that feels those things believes the way to do this is to gain power and influence and manipulation. Perhaps there is another part that thinks differently. A villain with an internal conflict is an interesting character. Remember to develop more than just your main character! 

*Examples* 
In the movie Notting Hill, Anna Scott is a world famous celebrity who is dating an ordinary man. Part of her loves the limelight and thrives on the attention it brings her, but part of her craves something normal as well. It is this part that needs to feel normal that truly appreciates what Hugh Grant’s character, William Thacker, brings to their relationship. 

While out for a meal, Anna and Will overhear the men at the next table discussing celebrities in general and Anna in particular in an unflattering and chauvinistic way. William tries to defend Anna and fails.

Anna is then caught in a dilemma. Part of her appreciates William’s effort, but part of her believes it will make no long term difference. Another part of her has learned it is better to ignore such comments and this part is joined by a part of her that fears what the media will say. Part of her is hurt by it. And another part is strong and wants to put the men in their place. This part, joined by the part of her that has an excellent witty sense of humor, eventually takes over and she does speak to the men, very deftly deflating their egos. Afterward, the part that is aware of her public persona comments, “I shouldn’t have done that.” But we can see she is pleased she did. And, as an audience, we are pleased she did as well!

# The Art of Characterization
## INTRODUCTION
This book is the result of my own **approach to characterization** as developed through the writing of numerous stories and several novels, an approach that has evolved to embrace the insight embodied in the quote from Stendhal that began this Introduction: Character is not created in isolation or repose; it’s forged through **interaction with others and the world.** Even in solitary struggles of endurance, such as arduous physical ordeals or battles with illness, there is a contest at the heart of the matter, between the part of us that would surrender and the part that continues on. 

The other main distinctive or innovative approaches addressed in this book include: 
	- Comprehending your characters begins with an honest, unflinching understanding of yourself. 
	- Scenes, in which characters engage meaningfully and in conflict with each other, are crucial at all stages of character development: conception, development, and portrayal. Character biographies created from scenes are intrinsically more useful than those consisting of mere information. 
	- A clear visual image of a character is a beginning, not an end. If you restrict yourself to a visual image in your “mind’s eye,” you risk contemplating the character like an idea, rather than forging an intuitive engagement with him. 
	- An intuitive grasp of your character is formed by exploring scenes of profound emotional import—moments of overwhelming shame, joy, fear, pride, regret, forgiveness. 
	- Developing a character with genuine depth requires a focus on not just desire but how the character deals with frustration of her desires, as well as her vulnerabilities, her secrets, and especially her contradictions. This development needs to be forged in scenes, the better to employ your intuition rather than your intellect.
	- This reliance on intuition provides the best way to respond meaningfully to what I call the Tyranny of Motive: the need to understand what a character wants and why he behaves a certain way. Without an intuitive grasp of the characters, you can all too easily fall into the trap of reducing them to simplistic automatons or “plot puppets,” acting in accordance with ideas or story necessities rather than behaving with the complexity of intention that real individuals possess. 
	- A character can undergo change through either growth or transformation, which can be distinguished by determining to what extent the character exhibits not just strength of will but insight in overcoming a personal limitation. 
	- Character arcs fall within a spectrum based on which protagonist question they most directly pose: 
		- Can I Get What I Want? 
		- Who Am I? or 
		- What Do I Have to Change About Myself to Get What I Want? 
	
There is of course a great deal more within these pages, so much so that it may seem daunting. But you can keep from feeling overwhelmed by thinking of this book as a kind of tool kit. Just as no one uses every tool he owns in the course of any project, so should no one consider employing more than what’s necessary for the task at hand: bringing a given character to life and rendering him on the page.
## All stages of character development
### Part 1 - Conceiving the Character
- This is done in the psychology workbook for writers.
#### Exercises - Characters Derived from Art or Nature
1. Pick two characters from a piece you’re working on. Make a point of noting specifically where your impression of them rests at the end of each working day. The next morning, before you begin to write, revisit each character in your mind’s eye. Do you hear or see—or better yet, feel—the character differently? Does she suggest an ability to act in a way she didn’t when you last visited her? Keep track of your progress over time. How has your intuition of the character evolved? How much of this transformation seems to be the result of your own deliberate work—i.e., creation? How much feels like discovery—i.e., seems to have emerged unconsciously?

#### Exercises - Characters Based on Real People
Review the following list. Reflect upon the person in your life who fits each description given—jot down her name, fix her in your mind, remember a few details about her life: her physical appearance, the effect she had on you, and anything else you think would be important if you were to describe her to someone who didn’t already know her. Pay particular attention first to those traits you consider fundamental, then second to those traits that surprise or intrigue you. If possible, try to recall a memorable or pivotal event involving you and the person in question: 
(a) A family member to whom you feel particularly close 
(b) A family member from whom you’re estranged or whom you particularly dislike 
(c) A stranger whose path crossed yours this past week 
(d) A person you know personally and admire 
(e) A person you know personally and fear 
(f) The love who got away 
(g) The love you wish had gotten away 
(h) First love
(i) Greatest love 
(j) Greatest childhood nemesis 
(k) Greatest adulthood nemesis 
(l) Person from childhood who annoyed you the most 
(m) Person in your present-day life who annoys you the most 
(n) Favorite neighbor 
(o) Least favorite neighbor 
(p) Favorite coworker 
(q) Least favorite coworker 
(r) Your mail carrier or someone else you deal with on a “business” level daily 
(s) An older person who has inspired you 
(t) A child who fascinates you 
(u) Someone on whom you have a secret crush 
(v) Someone you believe has a crush on you 
(w) A person who believed in you 
(x) A person who thought you’d never amount to anything 
(y) A person you envy 
(z) A person whose life you would never trade for your own

The first and most important thing this work should inspire is a deeper and more precise emotional connection to the people inhabiting your memory. Take a moment to register that emotional impact fully and meaningfully. We forget so much in the confusing and relentless demands of everyday life. This exercise is an attempt to dredge up from that oblivion what we have forgotten—but not lost. It can also be useful to take distinct eras of your life and ask these questions for each time period. A person who believed in you when you were in elementary school is an excellent character; but so is the one who believed in you when you hit your twenties, or middle age.

#### Exercises - Composite Characters
1. Take a story idea you’re currently working on. Assemble the dramatis personae you’ll need to make the story work. What do you know already about these characters? What’s conspicuously lacking—names, ages, physical appearance, family backgrounds, type of work they do, fears, loves, hatreds, desires? What else will you have to learn about them to make the story work? What information is conceivably irrelevant? 
2. Give yourself sufficient time without interruption in a quiet place. Let the daily mental business that preoccupies you settle down and fade into the background. Wait until a dreamlike scene or personage forms before your mind’s eye. If you simply see a figure, try to guide it into some form of action. If you see a scene, follow it through to some sense of completion. Write down what you observed. Pay particular attention to the setting—do you recognize it? How? Also attend to the power dynamic between the people in the scene, and its emotional tone. Did the scene touch you in some meaningful way? If not, can you think of supplying something consciously that might create a more emotionally affecting scene? 
3. Go to a book of paintings or photographs and select a person depicted in one of the plates. Insert that character into a scene you’re working on, the less “arty,” the better. What happens? How do the other characters react? What of interest changes? What doesn’t change? If the insertion feels forced, what could you change or add to make it feel more natural? 
4. Select a favorite piece of music and allow it to form a mental impression of a character, or use it as an accent or contrasting element to a character you’re already developing. Place that new or altered character in a scene you’re currently working on. Again: What happens? How do the other characters react? What of interest changes? What doesn’t change? 
5. Compare the results of the characters created for the preceding two exercises. Which of the two character sources—music or painting proved easier to work with, more vivid, more useful? Why? 
6. Select at least five of the people suggested in the list on pages 24–26 and do as the text suggested: Reflect upon the people in your life who fit the description given—jot down his or her name, fix him in your mind. Describe those traits you consider fundamental, then those traits that surprise you. Recall a memorable or pivotal scene involving you and the person. Take a moment to register that emotional impact fully and meaningfully. 
7. Identify and write a brief biographical sketch for three persons from your past not identified in the list provided. What makes them so memorable for you? 
8. Use one of the characters sketched in exercises 6–7 and find a way to use him or her in a piece on which you’re currently working. Does the character enrich the piece or detract from it? In either case, why? 
9. Take any two—or if you’re feeling ambitious, three—characters developed in the preceding exercises and mold them into a composite. Does this new character suggest opportunities for behavior and conflict that none of the sources he’s based on possess? Is there anything about the character that doesn’t seem to fit, suggesting irreconcilable traits, or a need for deeper, more detailed engagement with the character’s backstory or inner life in order to make the fit more organic, more credible?

#### Exercises - Personal Experience as an Intuitive Link to Character

**The most important emotional incidents to explore in a character’s life, and therefore your own, are:** 
(a) Moment of greatest fear 
(b) Moment of greatest courage 
(c) Moment of greatest sadness 
(d) Moment of greatest joy 
(e) Moment of deepest shame 
(f) Moment of most profound guilt 
(g) Moment of most redemptive forgiveness

(k) Most memorable moment of tenderness 
(l) Most shattering incident of violence 
(m) Most life-changing moment of passion 
(n) Moment of greatest danger 
(o) Worst illness 
(p) First experience with death 
(q) Most disturbing experience with death 
(r) Most shattering loss other than death 
Don’t suffer over the superlatives

**The following are some additional “prompts” to key significant emotional moments**
(a) First time as an adult you told someone you loved him (or her) 
(b) A time you said “I love you” and wished you hadn’t 
(c) A time when you were struck or beaten 
(d) A time you struck or beat someone else 
(e) Most memorable moment with a parent/sibling/child 
(f) Most memorable moment with a stranger 
(g) “Please stop. I’m scared.” 
(h) “Don’t hurt me.” 
(i) “Give that to me.” 
(j) “I’m telling.” 
(k) “Do as you’re told.” 
(l) “I can’t believe I just did that.”
(m) “I could kill you.” 
(n) “I’m not that kind of person.” (Or “You can’t ask me to do that.”) 
(o) “I thought you loved me.” 
(p) “No matter what I do, it will never be good enough.”

**Exercises**
1. Pick five of the suggested events or prompts in the two lists provided in this chapter and sketch the scene that emerges. Can you detect some thematic thread linking the scenes? What is it? 
2. Create three events or prompts of your own that spur emotionally significant scenes. 
3. Use one of the scenes developed for exercises 1 or 2 and find a way to use it in a piece on which you are currently working. Does it enrich the piece or detract from it? In either case, why? 
4. Identify a moment in your life when you’ve had to face your own misguided, wrongful, or hurtful behavior. Explore the insight that resulted, and how it changed how you acted or even the direction of your life. Provide a similar insight to one of the characters in the scene you’ve rewritten for exercise 3. How does this insight transform the scene? What decision results from the insight, and how does the character change his behavior? If his behavior doesn’t change, why not?

### Part 2 - Developing the Character
- The most important things that make visual and engagement possible: 
	- **The character needs or wants something**
	- **The character is having difficulty getting what they need or want**
	- **The character develops a plan for overcoming that difficulty**
	-  **The character exhibits a contradiction**
	- **Something unexpected happens which renders them vulnerable**
	- **There is more to their predicament than meets the eye--a secret**
#### Exercises - Desire as Purpose: A driving Need, Want, Ambition, or Goal
1. Select three books or films you’ve recently enjoyed. Identify the core desire, need, or ambition in at least three main characters. 
2. Do the same for three characters in a piece you’re currently working on, as well as three to five characters you developed in doing the exercises for chapters 2 and 3. 
3. Take the same characters chosen in exercise 2 and ask what would happen to them, what would happen to their stories, if their desires, needs, or ambitions exhibited any of the following: 
	1. The overall desire was an obsessive totem for multiple underlying desires. 
	2. The object of desire changed or became clearer due to conflicts endured. 
	3. The character suffered two irreconcilable desires. 
	4. The conscious desire conflicted with an unconscious one. 
	5. The object of desire was ultimately found to be worthless. 
	6. The character wanted one thing but got something else altogether. 
4. Don’t answer this question simplistically. Chart out how the story would change if it exhibited any of the foregoing characteristics. 
5. What have you learned about your characters by asking these questions?

1. Return to the characters identified in your responses for the first two exercises in the preceding chapter. Envision each character in a highly stressful situation: a robbery, a violent fight, an accident with a loved one, the need to end medical treatment for a terminally ill spouse or child or parent. How do they respond? Take your time; let the scene develop organically. 
2. For each of the same characters used for exercise 1, answer these questions: 
	1. What is the character’s core desire? How have previous attempts to gratify that desire been thwarted? Is there a single character who epitomizes the frustration of that unfulfilled desire? How does the ghost of the past revisit the character in the time of your story? What forms do his adaptations or defenses take? At what level is he stuck? 
	2. Is there a galvanic character in the present who serves as a revenant, someone who forces the main character to deal with his continuing inability to act honestly, bravely, responsibly?
#### Exercises - The Power of Wounds: Vulnerability
1. As before, select three characters from a piece you’re currently writing. Do any of them exhibit: A physical vulnerability—a wound, an illness, a disfiguring scar? A situational one—what threat(s) do they face in your story? A moral one—what sort of guilt are they risking due to the actions they commit? If none of these applies, supply one kind of vulnerability and see what happens. 
2. Once the three characters addressed in exercise 1 possess a vulnerability, identify what other characters in the story are drawn in because of that. Does the wounded character come to rely on the help of one of these other characters? How does that need for help play out? (For example, is there a successful outcome?) Or is the character betrayed or abandoned by his helper? Does the character, out of shame, blame himself for that betrayal or abandonment? 
3. Taking these same three characters: Do they believe they are worthy of love? If so, what person or persons in their past convinced them of this, and how and when did that happen? What elements of unworthiness persist, and what incidents and people are responsible? Picture the moments specifically; play them out as scenes. 
4. Again, the same three characters: When was the last time they were truly open with someone? How did it turn out?

#### Exercises - The Gravity of the Hidden: Secrets

1. Take three characters from a piece you’re currently writing and identify whether they possess any secrets. If so, how do those secrets affect their behavior vis-à-vis the other characters? Are any of the characters actively trying to unearth another’s secret? Why or why not? What would happen if one character were to disclose her secret to one of the other characters? (If nothing, choose a more damning, shameful, or devastating secret.)
   
2. Analyze the secrets you developed in your response to exercise 1. How long has the character been hiding this secret? How habitual is the concealment? Has that concealment become second nature? If so, what might force it back into consciousness?

3. For any of the characters you explored in the previous two exercises, does a secret form the ghost of the story? If so, who serves as revenant, to expose the ghost and force the main character to deal with bringing it into the open?

#### Exercises - The Paradox of This but That: Contradictions
1. Select three characters from a work of fiction or film you’ve recently enjoyed and ask if they exhibit any of the following contradictions:
	1. Physical, ironic, or comic juxtaposition 
	2. Need to serve multiple social roles 
	3. Competing morals or goals 
	4. A secret or deceit 
	5. Conscious versus unconscious traits 
	6. Dispositional or constitutional contradictions 
2. Do the same for three characters taken from a piece you’re currently working on. 
3. If a character chosen for exercises 1 and 2 does not possess a contradiction, supply one. What happens? Does it feel contrived or organic? In either case, why?

#### Exercises - Serving and Defying the Tyranny of Motive
1. Go back to a novel or film you’ve enjoyed recently. Take three characters from it and analyze a particularly key action each of them makes within the story. Ask yourself if there is a single identifiable motive for any of these actions, or whether there is instead a complex of factors prompting the action. Don’t be vague—tease out those multiple factors. 
2. Repeat the above exercise with two characters from a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Envision what would happen if the two characters from exercise 2 did exactly the opposite of what you’ve already written in the scenes you’ve chosen. Does that reversal violate or enhance your sense of what the character is capable of? If it feels wrong or forced, examine what causes this—is it possible, for example, that your sense of the character is needlessly limited?

#### Exercises - Flesh and Blood and Shoes: The Characters Physical Nature
1. Take a piece on which you are currently working and reflect on what would happen if you changed the sex, race, or age of one or more of its major characters. Has anything become possible or impossible with the change? If so, why? 
2. Using the same piece as chosen for exercise 1, imagine one or more main characters fumbling through an act of terribly unsatisfying sex (don’t make it solely the other character’s fault). Do you learn anything about your character? Why or why not? 
3. Taking these same characters, ask how their ages influence the way they view the world and interact with others. 
4. How do the characters chosen for the preceding exercises feel about their sexual allure? Do they feel comfortable in their own skin? Is their self-image consistent with an objective appraisal of their sex appeal? If not, why? 
5. Using the same characters, explore the issue of health: Have they ever been mortally ill? When? Have the effects of this illness lingered in some way? What if one or another of them were to suddenly become ill? Who would care for them? How would the character respond to that helplessness? 
6. For the same characters, explore their fashion sense and deportment. Put them in uncomfortable or out-of-the-ordinary clothes. How does their behavior change?

#### Exercises - The Tempest Within: The Character's Psychological Nature
1. Take two characters from a piece on which you are currently working and explore as discussed in this chapter each of the following psychological components of their makeup:
	1. Desire 
	2. Fear 
	3. Courage 
	4. Love 
	5. Hate 
	6. Shame 
	7. Guilt 
	8. Forgiveness 
	9. Failure 
	10. Success/Pride 
	11. Religion/Spirituality 
	12. Food 
	13. Death 
2. Has this work inspired any additional scenes, or suggested changes in scenes you’ve already written? If so, how? If not, why?

#### Exercises - The Teeming World
1. Take two characters from a piece you’re currently writing and explore as discussed in this chapter each of the following sociological relationships or areas of social engagement

Family 
	(a) Father 
	(b) Mother 
	(c) Grandparents 
	(d) Siblings 
	(e) Children 
	(f) Spouse 
Friends 
Name 
Class 
Work 
Education 
Geography 
Home 
“Tribe” 

Has this work inspired any additional scenes, or suggested changes in scenes you’ve already written. If so, how? If not, why?

#### Picking a Fight: Politics
1. Take two characters without any overt political affiliation from a book or film or TV program you’ve enjoyed. Look at how they address issues such as initiative, responsibility, discipline, danger, authority, communication, self-fulfillment, fairness. Can you discern a political inclination even though none is stated? Why or why not? 
2. In the same way as in exercise 1, explore the politics of the characters in a piece you’ve recently written. Did you unwittingly make them all vaguely of the same political stripe? What would happen if you changed one of the left-leaning characters rightward, or vice versa? 
3. Craft a character whose political convictions oppose your own. How successful is the result? Don’t decide for yourself; let others read the work and judge for themselves.

#### Quirks, Tics, and Bad Habits
1. Take a trip to any local spot where a variety of people mingle. Make notes of intriguing, odd, or vivid touches of seemingly inadvertent behavior. Then take two characters from a piece you’re working on and add one of these quirks, tics, or mindless habits to each. Does it feel organic or simply slathered on? What could you do to make it feel more natural? 
2. Do the same with another two characters, this time using one of the examples discussed in this chapter or one of the interrogative prompts. Again—does the result enhance the characterization or feel forced? How can you tell?

### Part 3 - Roles

#### Exercises - The Personal Nature of the Premise
1. Take three films or books you especially prize and identify the main characters. Who if any of them stands out as the protagonist? Why? What’s at stake for him or her? 
2. Do the same as in exercise 1 for a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Take three films or books you especially prize and try to discern the premise in each. Formulate it first as an abstract conjecture with a moral cause and an action, with either one good prevailing over another, a virtue overcoming a vice, or a vice defeating a virtue. Next, with these same three sources, outline the ways of life that are in opposition in the story. What does the protagonist consider the good life at the beginning of the story? What does he recognize as the good life at the end? What’s happened in between? If there’s an opponent or villain, what way of life is he defending or trying to preserve? Last, formulate the premises in terms of the individual characters themselves, their wants, their moral convictions, their struggles, their adversaries. Which formulation of the premise feels most natural to you? Which inspires you the most, engages you most? 
4. Do the same as in exercise 3 with a piece you’re currently writing. Which formulation of the premise feels not just most natural, but lends itself most readily to your work, returns you to the desire to write? 
5. Draw up a list of ten scenes from books or films that have moved you deeply. Identify what it is in each scene that you find so compelling. Do you detect in some of these scenes a certain thread of thematic similarity? Can you identify a set of personal themes you can use to guide your own writing?

#### Exercises - What do I Have to Change About Myself to Get What I Want?
1. Take three films or books you especially prize and identify the main characters. Who if any of them stands out as the protagonist? Why? What’s at stake for him or her?

#### Exercises - When the Narrator and Protagonist Differ, but Both are Characters in the Story

1. Return to the three protagonists you selected in response to exercise 1 in chapter 17. What risks does the protagonist take to achieve her main objective? Does her behavior, motivation, or resolve change as the conflict intensifies? How? 
2. In these same three examples, are any of the protagonists unaware, unclear, or frightened of their true desires at the outset of the story? When does their awareness crystallize? What action obliges that recognition? What is the dramatic effect of that insight
3. Take an event from your own life and dramatize it, with the protagonist based on yourself. What personal flaws, shortcomings, or limitations do you find most difficult to portray? How does the story require them? (If the event you’ve chosen doesn’t require depiction of a personal flaw or shortcoming, choose another.) Pay close attention to the feeling that arises as you discern the shortcomings in the character based on yourself: Are there any other characters you’ve created that have affected you in a similar way? Can you think of ways to improve their depiction now that you recognize their similarity to you? 
4. Consider a story with multiple main characters or story lines. Is there a character who provides the principal focus to the story—i.e., who effectively serves as protagonist? How can you tell? What happens in the climax of the story? Who is present? Who is most profoundly affected? What happens to the other characters in the climax and the denouement? 
5. Consider a story in which the narrator differs from the protagonist but also takes part in the action of the story. Does the focus of the story shift from narrator to protagonist at any time? Does this cause a division of sympathy, or a diffusion of dramatic effect? Why or why not?

#### Exercises - Can the Opponent Change?
1. Choose three novels or films with a clear-cut opponent. What are the qualities that spare him from being, to quote Conrad, “quite so black”? Does he change? 
2. Using the same examples, does he have stand-ins, proxies, underlings that do his bidding before his appearance in the story? How does the character of each of these surrogates compare or contrast with that of the opponent? How does any such contrast create suspense or surprise within the story? Ask these same questions of the opponent in a piece you’re currently writing.

#### Exercises - The Village
1. Return to the novels or films you selected for the exercises in the previous two chapters on the protagonist and the opponent. Identify the most significant secondary characters: Is there a ghost—a character in the protagonist’s backstory still exerting some troubling influence over the protagonist? Is there a revenant forcing the protagonist to deal with that influence in a positive way or to resolve the conflict it creates? Is there a counterweight character in the present time of the story impeding the protagonist’s efforts at insight or change? How do these characters help the protagonist confront or resolve his inner conflicts? Analyze how this gets dramatized in specific scenes. What moments of agreement or discord externalize those conflicts and allow the protagonist to focus on them? Are there any crucial allies? What specific form do they take: Mentor? Love interest? Sidekick? Expert? Confidant? Faithful servant? Do they also serve as revenant? Again, analyze how these characters in specific scenes assist the protagonist or opponent in pursuing their goals, then help flesh out the complexity of the plan each has undertaken.
2. Ask the same questions as in exercise 1 for a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Go through your bookshelf and your own work and find examples of each of the following types of secondary character: The Betrayer The Sympathetic Heavy The Visitor The Stranger As before, with each example, analyze the scenes they share with the protagonist or opponent for how the main character’s emotional complexity and depth is revealed, explored, and developed through their interactions with these characters. 
4. In the works you selected for the previous three exercises, identify the most significant secondary characters beyond those already addressed in the previous exercises, and analyze how, in specific exchanges, they help flesh out the protagonist’s and opponent’s distinct ways of life. What would be lost if any of them were eliminated? 
5. Return to the work you did in chapters 13 and 14 on the character’s psychological and sociological nature. How did this work provide you with suggestions for necessary secondary characters? Which roles did those secondary characters assume? Which possible characters fell by the wayside? Why?

### Part 4 - Technique
#### Exercises - Balancing Action and Inner Life
1. Take a scene from a novel or film you’ve recently enjoyed and break it down: What are the objective, obstacle, and action for each major character in the scene? What are the setup, turning point, and payoff for the scene? 
2. Do the same as in exercise 1 for a scene from a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Consult a novel you’ve recently enjoyed and try to find a section that appears to be composed solely of a character’s thoughts or feelings. Go back to the preceding scene and try to discern how its dramatic events led to the more descriptive section. In particular, does the passage provide an emotional response to the preceding action, or an analysis of options, or both? Is there a movement toward a decision or a change of heart in the character’s reflections? 
4. Taking the same novel or film chosen for exercise 1, can you identify any characters who embody or help externalize an inner conflict in the protagonist? 
5. Again, taking the same novel or film chosen for exercise 1, find a section where inner life is contrasted with outer action. How is this accomplished? How well does it work—i.e., what is learned about the character from this contrast?

#### Exercises - Point of View in Film and TV
1. Take three novels and ask the three key questions addressed at the outset of this chapter: Why is this story being told? Who has authority to tell it? What effect does the point of view achieve? How would the story be different if told from a different point of view? 
2. Take a self-contained section from a piece you’re currently writing and again ask those same three key questions. Have you chosen the point-of-view character wisely? Who else might step forward and assume that role? How does that change alter the quality of the telling? What events are now difficult or impossible to narrate because the point-of-view character isn’t in them? 
3. Using the same work in progress as for exercise 2, change the point of view from third to first, or vice versa. What has changed? Does the difference improve anything, dull an effect, enhance it, create greater or lesser intimacy with the point-of-view character, evoke naturalness in the telling?
4. Take a section from a first-person story or novel and look for transitions from subjective to objective modality, or vice versa. How does the transition work, what is the tonal effect of the movement, how does the language change, if at all? Does it feel convincing or leave you puzzled? In either case, why? Do the same for a story or novel section in the third person. 
5. Compare your results from exercise 4 for first and third person. Did you notice any particular difference in how transitions were handled? What were they? How did the distinct approaches to transition underscore the advantages or limitations of the point of view used? 
6. Take a novel in the omniscient point of view—Tess of the d’Urbervilles, by Thomas Hardy, for example, or Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, or Ann Patchett’s Bel Canto—and locate those sections that most conspicuously feel “omniscient,” i.e., from the point of view of an all-knowing intelligence. How unique or characteristic is the voice? How distinct is that voice from those of the characters? How could the omniscient point of view be rewritten as multiple third person? What would you miss? 
7. Take a film or TV script and analyze its first five scenes from the perspective of point of view. How many points of view are there? Are there too many? Does the focus seem scattered or simply ambitious? What are the various ways point of view is established in the scenes--i.e., how do you know which character is the central focus of the scene?

#### Exercises - Voice in the Portrayal of Character
1. Who would you identify as your ideal reader if you were hoping to feel inspired to do your best work? Your father? Your favorite teacher? A friend you trust? A writer you admire? A statesman you revere? Christ? Satan? 
2. What five works would you choose to copy if you were to follow James Frey’s advice and copy out the text for a half hour each morning? 
3. Review those five books for how voice is controlled to establish character. What distinguishes the voice of each character? The style of their word choice? The musicality and rhythm of their diction? The specific beliefs and fears that comprise their worldview? The snarl or song in their attitude? 
4. Do the same for a piece you’re currently working on. Assess your characters in terms of style, worldview, attitude. What could you do to enhance their characterization and to distinguish one from the other? How could you give them an “attitude adjustment” and enhance their distinctiveness?

#### Exercises - Creating Variety Among Characters
1. Take a section of dialog that you particularly admire from a book that has influenced you as a writer. Break down the scene in terms of each character’s objective, obstacle, and the various adjustments he employs to circumvent or overcome the obstacle and continue pursuing his objective. How does the character’s dialog reflect the objective, obstacle, and adjustments? How is his attitude reflected in the dialog? What elements of fear, joy, shame, guilt, pride, sorrow, or other emotional states come out during the scene? What elements of the character’s backstory does the dialog reveal? How are his educational level, regional background, economic station, moral or political disposition, work or profession, community or church expressed in his dialog? 
2. Do the same sort of breakdown analysis for a scene you’re currently writing. 
3. Take the same scene as in exercise 2 and use at least three of the techniques for enhancing realism in the dialog. How did you get the technique to conform to each character’s objective? How did that change the dynamic of the scene or the portrayal of the characters? 
4. Take a longer section of dialog you’ve written and remove all the speech tags. Are the speakers still readily identifiable? If not, how could you use beats, setting, or description instead of speech tags to solve this problem? 
5. Take a multicharacter dialog scene from a book or script and analyze what distinct vocal and attitude mannerisms are used to identify and render unique each individual.



**Every work of fiction explores four key questions: Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going? What does it mean? These questions apply not just to your characters. They apply to you. And the exploration is ongoing.**
