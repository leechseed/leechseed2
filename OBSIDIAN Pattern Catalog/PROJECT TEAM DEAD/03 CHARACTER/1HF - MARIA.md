## Flip the Script
The Theory 
**Once a person (or character) has absorbed messages from their early development, it is up to them to decide how to interpret those messages and what they will mean for their own individual world view and understanding of life, people, and the way the universe works.** In Transactional Analysis, this is called **life scripting**. The decisions that are made about the world get locked into a storyline in a person’s mind and are often very difficult to shift. People then behave according to their script – often ignoring the events of the real world that don’t support the scripted beliefs. Studies have shown that **a person’s expectations shape what they see and remember about the world around them.** **People who expect to be lucky see and remember opportunities that reinforce the belief in their luck.** People who expect to be unlucky do the same. Essentially, how we behave and react to the world is often less about what is actually happening than it is about what we already believe. If I think “the world is out to get me” then I perceive the checkout operator who short-changes me or the driver who stops a little too close to the pedestrian crossing as being deliberate attacks. As a result, I might react aggressively. If, however , I believe I live a happy, charmed life, then I will react completely differently to those events and be much more likely to write them off as insignificant accidents that have little or nothing to do with me. With this in mind, how our characters react to the events of the story will have a lot to do with their internal life script and beliefs about the world. **A writer needs to have an awareness of what the character’s life script and belief systems are – and find a way to communicate them to the reader without info dumping - to make the character believable.** (Remember the writer’s mantra: Show, don’t tell.) 

**These life scripts often fall into similar categories or patterns.** The script themes put forward in the book TA Today, by Ian Stewart and Vann Joines include:

**Until** – the idea that something good can’t happen until something less good has happened. E.g. “I can’t have dessert until I’ve eaten my vegetables” or, on a grander scale, “I can’t be successful until I’ve paid my dues.” Or perhaps, “I can’t go travelling until after I retire.” 

**After** – the idea that any enjoyable thing experienced now will have to be paid for afterward. E.g. “I’m enjoying this walk but I’ll be sore tomorrow.” The person engaged in this script type has trouble being happy because no matter how enjoyable the moment is, they believe they will suffer for it afterward. 

**Never** – the idea that the person will never get what they desire. E.g. “I’ll never meet the right person for a lasting relationship.” This script type prevents a person from taking the steps they need to achieve their goal because they do not believe the outcome is possible. 

**Always** – the idea that you will always get the same result. “Why does this always happen to me?” This person sticks with a job or relationship that isn’t working and complains about it without doing anything to make a change. Or they change to another job or relationship that is exactly the same as the old one and wonder why the outcome is also the same. 

**Almost** – the idea that one’s goal is never quite achieved. This person might sabotage themselves at the point of almost succeeding or they might simply change the goalposts when they arrive at their original goal, never feeling like they’ve truly “made it.” 

**Open ended** – the idea that they won’t know what to do with themselves after a certain point in time. “I’ll be great to be retired...but then what?” 

Think about how you can adapt some of these internal script ideas to fit your character and his or her background. The script needs to have a logic to it – even if that logic only makes sense in the character ’s own mind. Often these scripts don’t make sense to an adult perspective because they were set down in our subconscious as children. Part of your character's journey could be to challenge their script beliefs – thus creating internal conflict and generating an interesting personal dilemma for the character. Other characters will have different internal scripts and different ways of seeing the world and each other. This creates external conflict within the story. Think about giving major characters conflicting life scripts to keep things interesting and have them challenge each other. A character may have to confront the constraints of his or her life script during the course of the story. This could be a pivotal moment for the character’s development and for the plot. Narrative therapy takes a similar view on this but looks at it slightly differently. The view of the narrative therapist is that people tell themselves stories about the world, the people in it, and about themselves . There are many different stories that can be told from the same events, depending on what is focused on. Again, how we perceive the world and behave in reaction to it is more about the story we are telling ourselves than it is about the actual events of reality. By retelling a particular story and highlighting the evidence that supports it, I strengthen that story. 
For example, a person can tell themselves the story that they are always unlucky in love. They repeat this to themselves, and maybe to friends, and they point to relationship break ups or disappointments to support this particular story. The same person could, if they chose, to tell a different story – one in which they had a good relationship experience. This alternative story might require more effort because it has been told less often and the evidence to support it is less familiar . 
However , by seeking out the evidence – that is, remembering events that support the notion that they have had good relationships – and retelling this new story to themselves and others, they strengthen it and thus begin to see themselves and the world differently. You can see that a character who tells himself the first story may be very hesitant to commit to a relationship because he expects it to fail. The same character who focusses on the second internal story will be braver in relationships. The results in that character ’s life will be very different because he has behaved differently, because he believes differently, because he told himself a different story about his life and what to expect

**Again, the different stories set up an internal combat in the character , giving them a strong personal dilemma to deal with and a lesson to learn.** 
The character needs to resolve the conflict and figure out which story to believe – or whether there is another story that suits him better. His personal story about being unlucky in love may make him view a female character who is a potential love interest in a negative way and this could conflict with her own internal story about herself. Another character may have an internal story or belief that money is corrupting. As a result they dislike rich people, and have bad saving habits. These resulting behaviors may be completely subconscious and the character doesn’t fully understand why they feel that way. Think about the internal stories your characters tell about themselves, about others, about how their lives will play out, and about the world. 
Examples In the fairy-tale story of Cinderella, we see a version of the Until script at work. Cinderella’ s life is a miserable one and, in theory, she could take action to change this – she could leave home, attempt to wrest control of her family holdings from her stepmother, get another job – but she doesn’t. Cinderella has a life script that says things cannot improve for her until she has somehow suffered enough and is rescued. So she waits and eventually her life changes, not from something she does herself, but from the actions of her fairy godmother and the prince. 
In the television series, Game of Thrones, adapted from George R. R. Martin’s book series, A Song of Fire and Ice , we can see another script at work in Tyrion Lannister , particularly early in the series. Tyrion has, through a series of very strong childhood messages, developed the life script of Never. He believes he will never gain what he truly wants – the acceptance and love of his father. As a result, he refuses to try and spends his time (and money) on alcohol and brothels. It is when he begins to change his desire and aim to please someone more worthy than his father, that he manages to let go of this script and achieve moments of greatness. Further reading

### Build the Character
## *What scripts does the character have?*
"You're weak." - This message may have discouraged Maria from participating in physical activities, impacting her health or self-esteem.

"Money doesn't grow on trees." - This script could have instilled a scarcity mindset in Maria, leading her to be overly cautious with money and perhaps miss out on experiences or opportunities.

"Family is everything." - This message might make Maria highly loyal and dedicated to her family, but it could also make it difficult for her to assert her independence or prioritize other aspects of her life, like friendships or romantic relationships.

## *How do they behave as a result of their internal script beliefs?*

Here's how Maria might behave as a result of her internalized scripts:

1. "You're weak." - Maria might avoid physical activities, sports, or any situation where physical strength is required. She might shy away from challenges, assuming she won't be able to handle them. Her self-esteem may be low due to her belief in her own weakness, which can affect her confidence in many aspects of her life, from personal relationships to her career. She might also overcompensate in other areas (like intellectual pursuits) to try to make up for her perceived weakness.
**You're weak UNITL you're strong.**
    
2. "Money doesn't grow on trees." - Maria might be frugal or stingy, always looking for ways to save money. She might deny herself pleasures and experiences that require spending, living a life that's more restricted than it needs to be. She might also work excessively hard to secure her financial situation, sacrificing her personal time and relationships. Her fear of financial instability might also make her resistant to changes, like career shifts or investments, that carry financial risks.
**Money doesn't grow on trees UNTIL you find a money tree.**
    
3. "Family is everything." - Maria might devote a lot of her time and energy to her family, possibly at the expense of her personal interests, friendships, or romantic relationships. She might also struggle to make decisions that prioritize her own needs over her family's, leading to feelings of guilt or conflict. Her life might revolve around family events, traditions, and expectations. She might also avoid confrontation or honest communication with her family to maintain harmony, even when it's detrimental to her own wellbeing.
**Family is everything UNTIL it isn't.**
    

These behaviors can serve as a reflection of Maria's internal scripts, helping to convey her character to readers. They can also provide a basis for her character development, as she might eventually need to confront and reassess these beliefs to grow and change.

## *What behaviors will show change in these scripts as the story progresses?*

As Maria's character evolves, her behaviors would start to reflect a shift in her internal scripts. Here's how that could look for each script:

1. "You're weak." - Maria might start to challenge her belief about her weakness. This could manifest as her beginning to engage in physical activities, gradually building her strength and endurance. She might take on challenges she would have avoided before, showcasing her growing confidence and self-belief. These could range from physical feats to more abstract challenges, such as taking a stand in a disagreement or pursuing an ambitious goal.
    
2. "Money doesn't grow on trees." - Maria might start to loosen her tight control over money, allowing herself to enjoy her earnings and invest in experiences that enrich her life. She could **venture into financial risks**, like a career change or investment, showing her newfound belief in abundance and financial security. This doesn't mean she becomes reckless with money, but she develops a healthier, less fear-driven attitude towards it.
    
3. "Family is everything." - Maria could start **setting boundaries with her family**, **prioritizing her own needs and interests**. She might start to nurture her friendships or romantic relationships, demonstrating a more balanced view of interpersonal relationships. If there's conflict or dishonesty within her family, Maria might **initiate honest conversations to address them**, showing her willingness to confront familial issues rather than blindly prioritizing family harmony.
    

These behavioral changes can reveal Maria's internal growth and the shifting of her scripts. They can also create new dynamics in her relationships and situations, driving the story forward. It's important to remember that these changes are often gradual and not linear, and Maria might experience setbacks and moments of self-doubt along the way. But each step forward, no matter how small, signifies her ongoing growth and development.

## *What internal monologue stories are the strongest for this character?*

  
Internal monologues are an excellent way to provide insight into a character's thoughts, feelings, and struggles. Here are some examples of internal monologue narratives that could be potent for Maria:

1. "You're weak." - An ongoing internal struggle Maria could have is **the battle between her perceived weakness and her desire to prove herself.** This internal monologue could revolve around her doubts, fears, and her moments of courage. For example, "I've always been told I was weak, but I want to challenge that. Can I overcome this, or will I prove them right?"
    
2. "Money doesn't grow on trees." - **Maria's internal monologue could reflect her constant anxiety about money.** She might often find herself calculating expenses in her head, weighing every purchase, and worrying about future financial security. This can provide opportunities for Maria to question this mindset, such as: "I've always been so cautious with money. Is it really worth missing out on so much? Can I find a balance?"
    
3. "Family is everything." - **Maria's internal monologue could depict the struggle between her loyalty to her family and her need for independence.** She might often question her decisions, wondering whether she's prioritizing her family too much or too little. Her inner thoughts might revolve around questions like: "Am I giving too much of myself to my family? Am I being selfish for wanting more?"
    

These internal narratives can bring depth to Maria's character and help readers connect with her on a deeper level. They can also illustrate her internal growth as her beliefs start to shift, capturing her moments of realization, conflict, and decision-making.

## *Does the character have to challenge their script? How do they do this? How does the character grow as a result?*

Challenging one's scripts is a crucial aspect of personal growth, especially when these scripts have led to limiting beliefs or behaviors. Maria does not have to challenge her scripts, but doing so would allow her to break free from limiting patterns, experience new possibilities, and grow as a person.

Here's how Maria might challenge her scripts and grow as a result:

1. "You're weak." - **Maria can challenge this script by consciously seeking opportunities to test her strength, both physically and emotionally.** This could involve taking up a physical activity, standing up for herself in difficult situations, or taking on a challenging task. As Maria proves to herself that she is capable and strong, her self-esteem and confidence would grow. She would also develop resilience, learning that she can overcome obstacles and bounce back from setbacks.
    
2. "Money doesn't grow on trees." - Maria can challenge this script by experimenting with a more relaxed attitude towards money. **She might allow herself to spend on experiences that bring her joy, or take calculated financial risks, such as investing or changing careers.** As a result, Maria could develop a healthier relationship with money, viewing it not as a scarce resource to be hoarded, but as a tool that can enhance her life. She might also learn to trust in her ability to generate wealth and maintain financial security.
    
3. "Family is everything." - **Maria can challenge this script by asserting her independence and prioritizing her personal needs and relationships outside her family.** This might involve setting boundaries with her family, pursuing her personal interests, or investing in friendships or a romantic relationship. Through this, Maria would grow to understand that while family is important, it's also necessary to have a balanced life that includes self-care and diverse relationships. She might also learn to navigate familial conflicts in a healthier way, practicing open communication and mutual respect.
    

Challenging her scripts can make Maria a more rounded, balanced individual who can manage her life and relationships more effectively. This process can involve a lot of internal struggle and discomfort, but it also brings about significant growth and transformation, making Maria's character journey more compelling and relatable for readers.
