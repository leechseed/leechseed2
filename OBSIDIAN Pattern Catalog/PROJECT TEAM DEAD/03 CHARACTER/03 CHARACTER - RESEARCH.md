 *Which of the drivers/injunctions do these messages relate to?*
	 In Transactional Analysis (TA), a psychological and therapeutic approach developed by Eric Berne in the 1950s, Drivers and Injunctions are key concepts that describe specific sets of "rules" or messages that individuals often internalize from childhood experiences. These rules significantly influence their behaviors, feelings, and attitudes into adulthood.

1. **Drivers are unconscious messages that seem to "drive" our behavior.** They are often experienced as a sense of "I must do this," or "I should do this," even when the action may not be beneficial to the person. These were identified by therapist Taibi Kahler and include:
    
    - **"Be Perfect"** - A push to always meet extremely high standards.
    - **"Please Others"** - A feeling of needing to always make others happy or meet their needs.
    - **"Hurry Up"** - A sense of urgency, to always be doing things quickly.
    - **"Try Hard"** - An impulse to put maximum effort into everything, sometimes without completion.
    - **"Be Strong"** - A need to always appear tough, or unaffected by things that would upset others.
2. **Injunctions are negative, prohibitive messages or rules that individuals often internalize.** They often manifest as internal beliefs about what a person should not do or be. They were identified by psychotherapist Claude Steiner and include:
    
    - **"Don't Be"** - The most negative injunction, a message that one has no right to exist.
    - **"Don't Be You"** - A message that the true self is not acceptable.
    - **"Don't Be a Child"** - An injunction against behaving or feeling like a child.
    - **"Don't Grow Up"** - An injunction that prohibits developing into an independent adult.
    - **"Don't Make It"** - A prohibition against success.
    - **"Don't Be Important"** - A message that one should not draw attention or be acknowledged.
    - **"Don't Belong"** - An injunction against feeling part of a group.
    - **"Don't Be Close"** - A message that discourages intimacy.
    - **"Don't Be Well (Don't Be Sane)"** - An injunction against mental and physical health.
    - **"Don't Think"** - An injunction against independent thinking or decision making.
    - **"Don't Feel"** - A prohibition against expressing emotions.

These Drivers and Injunctions can have a powerful influence over an individual's patterns of behavior, thoughts, and emotional responses, often contributing to difficulties in relationships, work, and general mental health. They can be explored and addressed in therapy, especially in modalities like TA that emphasize understanding and changing these internalized rules.

|Be Perfect|Don't Make It|
|Please Others|Don't Be You|
