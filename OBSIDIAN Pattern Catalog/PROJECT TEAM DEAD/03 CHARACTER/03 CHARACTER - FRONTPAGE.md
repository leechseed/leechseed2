> **03 CHARACTER** - A character refers to an individual or entity that is part of the story and plays a role in advancing the narrative. Characters are the driving force behind the events, conflicts, and emotions that unfold in the fictional world. They can be human, non-human (such as animals or supernatural beings), or even inanimate objects (personified entities). Each character possesses unique traits, personalities, motivations, and backgrounds that contribute to their distinct role within the story.
