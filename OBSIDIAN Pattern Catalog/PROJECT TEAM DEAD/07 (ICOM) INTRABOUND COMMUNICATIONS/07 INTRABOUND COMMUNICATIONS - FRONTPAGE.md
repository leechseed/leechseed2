> **07 INTRABOUND COMMUNICATIONS** - Intrabound Communications the amalgamation of dialogue, character perspective, and the particular language employed within the story world of a narrative. It's an intrinsic layer of communication that solely pertains to the interactions happening within the narrative, distinct from the author's direct communication with the reader.

1. **Dialogue** represents the verbal exchanges between characters, which not only provides information about events but also reveals characters' personalities, relationships, intentions, and conflicts.
    
2. **Character Perspective** (or Point of View) defines the angle through which the story is observed and narrated. It shapes the perception of events and characters and determines what information is revealed or concealed from the reader.
    
3. The **Language of the Storyworld** refers to the specific linguistic landscape constructed within the narrative, such as idioms, slang, jargon, or dialect unique to the story's setting, time period, or characters.
    

Together, these components construct the "Intrabound Communications" of a narrative, an underlying pattern layer that conveys key story elements and themes. This internal story world language system, separate from the author-reader communication, can effectively express thematic concepts and deepen the narrative's richness and immersive quality. It's a synergistic narrative device that intricately weaves together the voices and perspectives within the story, thereby enhancing the reader's engagement and comprehension of the narrative's deeper meanings.
