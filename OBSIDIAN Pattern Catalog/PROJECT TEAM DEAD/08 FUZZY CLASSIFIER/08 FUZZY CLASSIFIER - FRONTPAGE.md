> **08 FUZZY CLASSIFIER** - The Fuzzy Classifier is an adaptable framework that combines elements such as genre, tropes, and thematic patterns, present across diverse media forms.

1. **Genre** refers to a category of art, music, or literature that follows a particular style or content. It provides a broad classification based on shared characteristics and conventions, helping creators and audiences to understand the general themes and expectations of a work.
    
2. **Tropes** are recurring, recognizable elements, themes, or conventions in a particular genre or body of work. They provide a common language for patterns and recurring motifs in storytelling.
    
3. **Thematic Patterns** are repeated themes that occur in a narrative, contributing to the overall message or motif of the work. They provide depth and complexity to the narrative, enhancing the interpretive experience for the audience.
    

The "Fuzzy Classifier" could be seen as a flexible and dynamic classification system that recognizes the overlap and interconnectedness of these components across various media forms. Its purpose is to enable the world of creative pattern-making to transcend the boundaries of individual mediums, promoting a more integrated, holistic approach to narrative design. This system assists writers and narrative designers in identifying, referencing, and manipulating narrative patterns in accordance with the specific needs and goals of their current project. In doing so, it aids in fostering innovative, cross-media narrative strategies and enhances the richness and depth of the storytelling process.
