> **01 THEME** - Theme serves as the foundational concept around which a story is built. The story, in turn, expands upon this concept by offering diverse perspectives on the theme, conveyed through the various elements of storytelling such as characters, events, and narrative components. These variations help deepen our understanding and exploration of the underlying theme.

### Additional Information 
	Mckee and Bloom are the two foundational authors I reference when creating themes.

I've compiled a compact set of thematic analyses I previously conducted in Logseq. These excerpts touch on themes found in literature, and I'm currently expanding on them as part of my ongoing project in Obsidian.

### Bloom's 15 Themes 

*Each one of these 15 themes is identified by Bloom to be universal in literature, at least in terms of his modern cannon from a North American Perspective. After reading each one of these books I have found myself identifying with the narratives presented in each of these universal themes. I believe they can serve as overall topos or overarching themes present in every one of my novels. Keep in mind that I do go in depth a bit regarding how to structure these 15 themes together in...* [01_LOGSEQ THEME STUDIES](obsidian://open?vault=STORY%20DEVELOPMENT%20TEMPLATE&file=01_THEME%2F01_LOGSEQ%20THEME%20STUDIES%20-%20Cardenas%2C%20Jay)
#### 01110_ALIENATION - BLOOM, HOWARD
Bloom interprets alienation in the works of Hamlet and Kafka as a deep internal struggle, often unvoiced, highlighting the tragic complexity of human self-alienation and inner turmoil.
