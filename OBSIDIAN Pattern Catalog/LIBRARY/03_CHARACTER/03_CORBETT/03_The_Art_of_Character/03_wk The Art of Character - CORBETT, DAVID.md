#### **Introduction**
This worksheet explores the intricate process of character development, examining the balance between deliberate creation and organic discovery. By reflecting on your characters in the context of your own writing habits and inclinations, you can gain deeper insights into their nature and evolution.

**Directions:** Follow the exercises below with a commitment to introspection and honesty. Use the nested bulleted lists for detailed exploration. Keep this worksheet handy as you develop your characters, returning to it for guidance and reflection.

## Chapter Five - Desire as Purpose: A Driving Need, Want, Ambition, or Goal
#### Exercises - Desire as Purpose: A driving Need, Want, Ambition, or Goal
1. Select three books or films you’ve recently enjoyed. Identify the core desire, need, or ambition in at least three main characters. 
2. Do the same for three characters in a piece you’re currently working on, as well as three to five characters you developed in doing the exercises for chapters 2 and 3. 
3. Take the same characters chosen in exercise 2 and ask what would happen to them, what would happen to their stories, if their desires, needs, or ambitions exhibited any of the following: 
	1. The overall desire was an obsessive totem for multiple underlying desires. 
	2. The object of desire changed or became clearer due to conflicts endured. 
	3. The character suffered two irreconcilable desires. 
	4. The conscious desire conflicted with an unconscious one. 
	5. The object of desire was ultimately found to be worthless. 
	6. The character wanted one thing but got something else altogether. 
4. Don’t answer this question simplistically. Chart out how the story would change if it exhibited any of the foregoing characteristics. 
5. What have you learned about your characters by asking these questions?

1. Return to the characters identified in your responses for the first two exercises in the preceding chapter. Envision each character in a highly stressful situation: a robbery, a violent fight, an accident with a loved one, the need to end medical treatment for a terminally ill spouse or child or parent. How do they respond? Take your time; let the scene develop organically. 
2. For each of the same characters used for exercise 1, answer these questions: 
	1. What is the character’s core desire? How have previous attempts to gratify that desire been thwarted? Is there a single character who epitomizes the frustration of that unfulfilled desire? How does the ghost of the past revisit the character in the time of your story? What forms do his adaptations or defenses take? At what level is he stuck? 
	2. Is there a galvanic character in the present who serves as a revenant, someone who forces the main character to deal with his continuing inability to act honestly, bravely, responsibly?


## Chapter Six - Desire Denied: Adaptations, Defense Mechanisms, and Pathological Maneuvers

## Chapter Seven - The Power of Wounds: Vulnerability 
#### Exercises - The Power of Wounds: Vulnerability
1. As before, select three characters from a piece you’re currently writing. Do any of them exhibit: A physical vulnerability—a wound, an illness, a disfiguring scar? A situational one—what threat(s) do they face in your story? A moral one—what sort of guilt are they risking due to the actions they commit? If none of these applies, supply one kind of vulnerability and see what happens. 
2. Once the three characters addressed in exercise 1 possess a vulnerability, identify what other characters in the story are drawn in because of that. Does the wounded character come to rely on the help of one of these other characters? How does that need for help play out? (For example, is there a successful outcome?) Or is the character betrayed or abandoned by his helper? Does the character, out of shame, blame himself for that betrayal or abandonment? 
3. Taking these same three characters: Do they believe they are worthy of love? If so, what person or persons in their past convinced them of this, and how and when did that happen? What elements of unworthiness persist, and what incidents and people are responsible? Picture the moments specifically; play them out as scenes. 
4. Again, the same three characters: When was the last time they were truly open with someone? How did it turn out?
## Chapter Eight - The Gravity of the Hidden: Secrets 
#### Exercises - The Gravity of the Hidden: Secrets

1. Take three characters from a piece you’re currently writing and identify whether they possess any secrets. If so, how do those secrets affect their behavior vis-à-vis the other characters? Are any of the characters actively trying to unearth another’s secret? Why or why not? What would happen if one character were to disclose her secret to one of the other characters? (If nothing, choose a more damning, shameful, or devastating secret.)
   
2. Analyze the secrets you developed in your response to exercise 1. How long has the character been hiding this secret? How habitual is the concealment? Has that concealment become second nature? If so, what might force it back into consciousness?

3. For any of the characters you explored in the previous two exercises, does a secret form the ghost of the story? If so, who serves as revenant, to expose the ghost and force the main character to deal with bringing it into the open?
## Chapter Nine - The Paradox of This but That: Contradictions
#### Exercises - The Paradox of This but That: Contradictions
1. Select three characters from a work of fiction or film you’ve recently enjoyed and ask if they exhibit any of the following contradictions:
	1. Physical, ironic, or comic juxtaposition 
	2. Need to serve multiple social roles 
	3. Competing morals or goals 
	4. A secret or deceit 
	5. Conscious versus unconscious traits 
	6. Dispositional or constitutional contradictions 
2. Do the same for three characters taken from a piece you’re currently working on. 
3. If a character chosen for exercises 1 and 2 does not possess a contradiction, supply one. What happens? Does it feel contrived or organic? In either case, why?
## Chapter Ten - Serving and Defying the Tyranny of Motive
#### Exercises - Serving and Defying the Tyranny of Motive
1. Go back to a novel or film you’ve enjoyed recently. Take three characters from it and analyze a particularly key action each of them makes within the story. Ask yourself if there is a single identifiable motive for any of these actions, or whether there is instead a complex of factors prompting the action. Don’t be vague—tease out those multiple factors. 
2. Repeat the above exercise with two characters from a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Envision what would happen if the two characters from exercise 2 did exactly the opposite of what you’ve already written in the scenes you’ve chosen. Does that reversal violate or enhance your sense of what the character is capable of? If it feels wrong or forced, examine what causes this—is it possible, for example, that your sense of the character is needlessly limited?



## Chapter Eleven - Dynamic Versus Static: Creating a Biography from Scenes



## Chapter Twelve Flesh and Blood and Shoes: The Character's Physical Nature

## Chapter Thirteen - The Tempest Within: The Character's Psychological Nature

	(d) Siblings 
	(e) Children 
	(f) Spouse 
Friends 
Name 
Class 
Work 
Education 
Geography 
Home 
“Tribe” 

Has this work inspired any additional scenes, or suggested changes in scenes you’ve already written. If so, how? If not, why?

## Chapter Fifteen - Picking a Fight: Politics
#### Picking a Fight: Politics
1. Take two characters without any overt political affiliation from a book or film or TV program you’ve enjoyed. Look at how they address issues such as initiative, responsibility, discipline, danger, authority, communication, self-fulfillment, fairness. Can you discern a political inclination even though none is stated? Why or why not? 
2. In the same way as in exercise 1, explore the politics of the characters in a piece you’ve recently written. Did you unwittingly make them all vaguely of the same political stripe? What would happen if you changed one of the left-leaning characters rightward, or vice versa? 
3. Craft a character whose political convictions oppose your own. How successful is the result? Don’t decide for yourself; let others read the work and judge for themselves.

## Chapter Sixteen - Quirks ,Tics, and Bad Habits
#### Quirks, Tics, and Bad Habits
1. Take a trip to any local spot where a variety of people mingle. Make notes of intriguing, odd, or vivid touches of seemingly inadvertent behavior. Then take two characters from a piece you’re working on and add one of these quirks, tics, or mindless habits to each. Does it feel organic or simply slathered on? What could you do to make it feel more natural? 
2. Do the same with another two characters, this time using one of the examples discussed in this chapter or one of the interrogative prompts. Again—does the result enhance the characterization or feel forced? How can you tell?
# Part III - Roles
## Chapter Seventeen - Meaning and Its Messenger: The Protagonist and the Premise
#### Exercises - Meaning and Its Messenger: The Protagonist and the Premise
1. Take three films or books you especially prize and identify the main characters. Who if any of them stands out as the protagonist? Why? What’s at stake for him or her? 
2. Do the same as in exercise 1 for a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Take three films or books you especially prize and try to discern the premise in each. Formulate it first as an abstract conjecture with a moral cause and an action, with either one good prevailing over another, a virtue overcoming a vice, or a vice defeating a virtue. Next, with these same three sources, outline the ways of life that are in opposition in the story. What does the protagonist consider the good life at the beginning of the story? What does he recognize as the good life at the end? What’s happened in between? If there’s an opponent or villain, what way of life is he defending or trying to preserve? Last, formulate the premises in terms of the individual characters themselves, their wants, their moral convictions, their struggles, their adversaries. Which formulation of the premise feels most natural to you? Which inspires you the most, engages you most? 
4. Do the same as in exercise 3 with a piece you’re currently writing. Which formulation of the premise feels not just most natural, but lends itself most readily to your work, returns you to the desire to write? 
5. Draw up a list of ten scenes from books or films that have moved you deeply. Identify what it is in each scene that you find so compelling. Do you detect in some of these scenes a certain thread of thematic similarity? Can you identify a set of personal themes you can use to guide your own writing?
## Chapter Eighteen - The Challenge of Change: Three Protagonist Questions
#### Exercises - What do I Have to Change About Myself to Get What I Want?
1. Take three films or books you especially prize and identify the main characters. Who if any of them stands out as the protagonist? Why? What’s at stake for him or her? 
2. Do the same as in exercise 1 for a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Take three films or books you especially prize and try to discern the premise in each. Formulate it first as an abstract conjecture with a moral cause and an action, with either one good prevailing over another, a virtue overcoming a vice, or a vice defeating a virtue. Next, with these same three sources, outline the ways of life that are in opposition in the story. What does the protagonist consider the good life at the beginning of the story? What does he recognize as the good life at the end? What’s happened in between? If there’s an opponent or villain, what way of life is he defending or trying to preserve? Last, formulate the premises in terms of the individual characters themselves, their wants, their moral convictions, their struggles, their adversaries. Which formulation of the premise feels most natural to you? Which inspires you the most, engages you most? 
4. Do the same as in exercise 3 with a piece you’re currently writing. Which formulation of the premise feels not just most natural, but lends itself most readily to your work, returns you to the desire to write? 
5. Draw up a list of ten scenes from books or films that have moved you deeply. Identify what it is in each scene that you find so compelling. Do you detect in some of these scenes a certain thread of thematic similarity? Can you identify a set of personal themes you can use to guide your own writing?

## Chapter Nineteen - Ciphers, Stiffs, and Sleepwalkers: Protagonist Problems 
#### Exercises - When the Narrator and Protagonist Differ, but Both are Characters in the Story

1. Return to the three protagonists you selected in response to exercise 1 in chapter 17. What risks does the protagonist take to achieve her main objective? Does her behavior, motivation, or resolve change as the conflict intensifies? How? 
2. In these same three examples, are any of the protagonists unaware, unclear, or frightened of their true desires at the outset of the story? When does their awareness crystallize? What action obliges that recognition? What is the dramatic effect of that insight
3. Take an event from your own life and dramatize it, with the protagonist based on yourself. What personal flaws, shortcomings, or limitations do you find most difficult to portray? How does the story require them? (If the event you’ve chosen doesn’t require depiction of a personal flaw or shortcoming, choose another.) Pay close attention to the feeling that arises as you discern the shortcomings in the character based on yourself: Are there any other characters you’ve created that have affected you in a similar way? Can you think of ways to improve their depiction now that you recognize their similarity to you? 
4. Consider a story with multiple main characters or story lines. Is there a character who provides the principal focus to the story—i.e., who effectively serves as protagonist? How can you tell? What happens in the climax of the story? Who is present? Who is most profoundly affected? What happens to the other characters in the climax and the denouement? 
5. Consider a story in which the narrator differs from the protagonist but also takes part in the action of the story. Does the focus of the story shift from narrator to protagonist at any time? Does this cause a division of sympathy, or a diffusion of dramatic effect? Why or why not?

## Chapter Twenty The Character of Conflict: The Opponent
#### Exercises - Can the Opponent Change?
1. Choose three novels or films with a clear-cut opponent. What are the qualities that spare him from being, to quote Conrad, “quite so black”? Does he change? 
2. Using the same examples, does he have stand-ins, proxies, underlings that do his bidding before his appearance in the story? How does the character of each of these surrogates compare or contrast with that of the opponent? How does any such contrast create suspense or surprise within the story? Ask these same questions of the opponent in a piece you’re currently writing.
## Chapter Twenty-one - The Army of Others: Secondary Characters
#### Exercises - The Village
1. Return to the novels or films you selected for the exercises in the previous two chapters on the protagonist and the opponent. Identify the most significant secondary characters: Is there a ghost—a character in the protagonist’s backstory still exerting some troubling influence over the protagonist? Is there a revenant forcing the protagonist to deal with that influence in a positive way or to resolve the conflict it creates? Is there a counterweight character in the present time of the story impeding the protagonist’s efforts at insight or change? How do these characters help the protagonist confront or resolve his inner conflicts? Analyze how this gets dramatized in specific scenes. What moments of agreement or discord externalize those conflicts and allow the protagonist to focus on them? Are there any crucial allies? What specific form do they take: Mentor? Love interest? Sidekick? Expert? Confidant? Faithful servant? Do they also serve as revenant? Again, analyze how these characters in specific scenes assist the protagonist or opponent in pursuing their goals, then help flesh out the complexity of the plan each has undertaken.
2. Ask the same questions as in exercise 1 for a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Go through your bookshelf and your own work and find examples of each of the following types of secondary character: The Betrayer The Sympathetic Heavy The Visitor The Stranger As before, with each example, analyze the scenes they share with the protagonist or opponent for how the main character’s emotional complexity and depth is revealed, explored, and developed through their interactions with these characters. 
4. In the works you selected for the previous three exercises, identify the most significant secondary characters beyond those already addressed in the previous exercises, and analyze how, in specific exchanges, they help flesh out the protagonist’s and opponent’s distinct ways of life. What would be lost if any of them were eliminated? 
5. Return to the work you did in chapters 13 and 14 on the character’s psychological and sociological nature. How did this work provide you with suggestions for necessary secondary characters? Which roles did those secondary characters assume? Which possible characters fell by the wayside? Why?

# Part IV - Technique

## Chapter Twenty-two - The Clash of Character: Scenes
#### Exercises - Balancing Action and Inner Life
1. Take a scene from a novel or film you’ve recently enjoyed and break it down: What are the objective, obstacle, and action for each major character in the scene? What are the setup, turning point, and payoff for the scene? 
2. Do the same as in exercise 1 for a scene from a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Consult a novel you’ve recently enjoyed and try to find a section that appears to be composed solely of a character’s thoughts or feelings. Go back to the preceding scene and try to discern how its dramatic events led to the more descriptive section. In particular, does the passage provide an emotional response to the preceding action, or an analysis of options, or both? Is there a movement toward a decision or a change of heart in the character’s reflections? 
4. Taking the same novel or film chosen for exercise 1, can you identify any characters who embody or help externalize an inner conflict in the protagonist? 
5. Again, taking the same novel or film chosen for exercise 1, find a section where inner life is contrasted with outer action. How is this accomplished? How well does it work—i.e., what is learned about the character from this contrast?

## Chapter Twenty-three - The Personal Perspective: Point of View
#### Exercises - Point of View in Film and TV
1. Take three novels and ask the three key questions addressed at the outset of this chapter: Why is this story being told? Who has authority to tell it? What effect does the point of view achieve? How would the story be different if told from a different point of view? 
2. Take a self-contained section from a piece you’re currently writing and again ask those same three key questions. Have you chosen the point-of-view character wisely? Who else might step forward and assume that role? How does that change alter the quality of the telling? What events are now difficult or impossible to narrate because the point-of-view character isn’t in them? 
3. Using the same work in progress as for exercise 2, change the point of view from third to first, or vice versa. What has changed? Does the difference improve anything, dull an effect, enhance it, create greater or lesser intimacy with the point-of-view character, evoke naturalness in the telling?
4. Take a section from a first-person story or novel and look for transitions from subjective to objective modality, or vice versa. How does the transition work, what is the tonal effect of the movement, how does the language change, if at all? Does it feel convincing or leave you puzzled? In either case, why? Do the same for a story or novel section in the third person. 
5. Compare your results from exercise 4 for first and third person. Did you notice any particular difference in how transitions were handled? What were they? How did the distinct approaches to transition underscore the advantages or limitations of the point of view used? 
6. Take a novel in the omniscient point of view—Tess of the d’Urbervilles, by Thomas Hardy, for example, or Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, or Ann Patchett’s Bel Canto—and locate those sections that most conspicuously feel “omniscient,” i.e., from the point of view of an all-knowing intelligence. How unique or characteristic is the voice? How distinct is that voice from those of the characters? How could the omniscient point of view be rewritten as multiple third person? What would you miss? 
7. Take a film or TV script and analyze its first five scenes from the perspective of point of view. How many points of view are there? Are there too many? Does the focus seem scattered or simply ambitious? What are the various ways point of view is established in the scenes--i.e., how do you know which character is the central focus of the scene?

## Chapter Twenty-four - Language as Attitude: Voice
#### Exercises - Voice in the Portrayal of Character
1. Who would you identify as your ideal reader if you were hoping to feel inspired to do your best work? Your father? Your favorite teacher? A friend you trust? A writer you admire? A statesman you revere? Christ? Satan? 
2. What five works would you choose to copy if you were to follow James Frey’s advice and copy out the text for a half hour each morning? 
3. Review those five books for how voice is controlled to establish character. What distinguishes the voice of each character? The style of their word choice? The musicality and rhythm of their diction? The specific beliefs and fears that comprise their worldview? The snarl or song in their attitude? 
4. Do the same for a piece you’re currently working on. Assess your characters in terms of style, worldview, attitude. What could you do to enhance their characterization and to distinguish one from the other? How could you give them an “attitude adjustment” and enhance their distinctiveness?

## Chapter Twenty-five - Word as Deed: Dialog 
#### Exercises - Creating Variety Among Characters
1. Take a section of dialog that you particularly admire from a book that has influenced you as a writer. Break down the scene in terms of each character’s objective, obstacle, and the various adjustments he employs to circumvent or overcome the obstacle and continue pursuing his objective. How does the character’s dialog reflect the objective, obstacle, and adjustments? How is his attitude reflected in the dialog? What elements of fear, joy, shame, guilt, pride, sorrow, or other emotional states come out during the scene? What elements of the character’s backstory does the dialog reveal? How are his educational level, regional background, economic station, moral or political disposition, work or profession, community or church expressed in his dialog? 
2. Do the same sort of breakdown analysis for a scene you’re currently writing. 
3. Take the same scene as in exercise 2 and use at least three of the techniques for enhancing realism in the dialog. How did you get the technique to conform to each character’s objective? How did that change the dynamic of the scene or the portrayal of the characters? 
4. Take a longer section of dialog you’ve written and remove all the speech tags. Are the speakers still readily identifiable? If not, how could you use beats, setting, or description instead of speech tags to solve this problem? 
5. Take a multicharacter dialog scene from a book or script and analyze what distinct vocal and attitude mannerisms are used to identify and render unique each individual.



**Every work of fiction explores four key questions: Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going? What does it mean? These questions apply not just to your characters. They apply to you. And the exploration is ongoing.**
