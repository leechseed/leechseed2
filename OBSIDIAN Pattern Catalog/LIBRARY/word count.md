In “A Finnish Winter Day,” instances of heterodiegetic narration with internal focalization are clear in cases where the narrator adopts someone else’s internal point of view. The “natural” combination of homodiegetic narration with internal focalization means someone reporting from her own point of view; in this case, the narrator, who occupies the world documented, visits the points of view of the informants. Here is an example of a morning in the city of Hämeenlinna, where a family with children live: Janne [the father] woke up to the sound of snow thomping down from the roof. Thaw had set in and loosened the snow on the tin roof. It was only six o’clock so there was still time to have a little nap. Eeva [the mother], however, had to get up, she had to leave for work in an hour. The first sentence immediately begins with the experiencing subject’s perception (a sound). This is followed by an explanation of the sound, whichsince Janne was placed as the focalizer in the first sentence—may well be interpreted as Janne’s thoughts and rationale of the sound he heard. Next, both Janne’s and Eeva’s thoughts on the time and their plans for the day are described. In this example, temporal and spatial orientation is fixed to the experiencing characters, and focalization changes smoothly between Janne and Eeva. Even so, there is no clear distinction between the two experiencing and thinking minds: Janne is most likely the focalizer in the third sentence and Eeva in the fourth, but the two sentences still logically follow into each other. The move from one mind to another while keeping the thematic orientation indicates the narrator’s selection of the parts of the minds to represent. The story from Hämeenlinna ends in the evening: “Janne lit the fire and soon it was time for the boys to come in; have an evening snack and get to bed. It was nice to go to sleep with the fireplace warming up the house.” This ending returns to the characters’ experience as the narrator sums up the feelings that produce the “niceness” of the setting. The narrative begins and ends with the characters’ point of view, but the narrator controls what is narrated. Textually, the examples come closest to thought report, which is the narrator’s mode of relating a character’s consciousness. Since the voice of the character is not clearly separate from that of the narrator, these examples do not fit a prototypical case of thought report as defined by Cohn (1978, 46–47; see Palmer 2005). They do, however, utilize the discursive freedoms allowed by this form of thought report—presenting the character’s consciousness as mental action (“woke up”), and summarizing inner development or reasoning (“had to,” “was nice”; Palmer 2005, 604). Examples of the characters’ points of view abound in visual focalization, as well. I have chosen one series of photographs to illustrate this (see photographs 1, 2, and 3). The example portrays Titta, an elderly woman in sheltered housing in the city of Lahti. At the beginning, the verbal narrator states that Titta’s options were limited: being childless, she had nobody to take care of her when she got old and developed mild disabilities, so sheltered housing was the logical choice. Photograph number one starts the morning sequence, and photographs two and three end the evening. The first photograph shows the character Titta seen from the outside. She is very small in the picture and visible only partially through the venetian blinds on the windows. According to the customary viewing (and reading) orientation, the viewer starts from the left of the picture and approaches Titta, whose small size and distant positioning are visually enforced by the slats of the blinds aligning with the perspective of the picture. The next photograph gives an over-the-shoulder shot, where the point of view has moved indoors and the viewer both sees Titta and partially shares the view she would have if she were to look up from the paper she is reading. Titta is again very small and positioned low compared to the window and the balcony railing between her and the world outside. Whereas the viewer’s position in the first photograph was very alienated from Titta, the second photograph invites the viewer to partially share her (potential) view. The third photograph completes the series as it fully immerses the viewer in Titta’s perspective: a point-of-view shot gives the viewer the same landscape view Titta has through the venetian blinds. The visual angle is from a slightly higher position than Titta had in the previous picture. This enables the camera to show a kind of hypothetical focalization point: what Titta would see were she to stand up and look out. The balcony railing is still visible in the photograph as a bar between Titta’s apartment and the world outside. This series of photographs starts with a view from outside, moves into Titta’s sheltered housing flat, and ends with a (possible) view out. This series creates an opposition between the outside and inside worlds. The viewer first observes Titta as if she were an exotic creature behind the window and the horizontal slats. The viewer is then invited to share Titta’s view via an over-the-shoulder shot not only from behind the window and the venetian blind slats, but also from the balcony railing. Furthermore, the view is restricted by the window frames on both sides. These pictures suggest Titta is isolated in the assisted housing unit from the rest of the world on the other side of the window. The same impression of isolation is also provided by the verbal text: Titta is a 76-year-old woman living in sheltered accommodation for the elderly. She moved in about two years ago after being ill for a long time. When the flat she rented was put for sale, sheltered housing provided the single woman with no children with “a safety network” she lacked. Her close relatives either lived a long way away or were elderly themselves. At the end of the day the decision about moving into a sheltered housing complex was easy. Some adaptation was required when an independent life was replaced by a large community of different people living in the complex. The residents have their own flats with kitchens, and they are free to decorate their homes and lead an independent life. One can also choose to pass some of the everyday routines of the establishment. For example, sometimes Titta has her breakfast in her own room. She wants to avoid institutionalization and do as many things as possible by herself, even though her condition sometimes sets restrictions. In the past Titta had many cultural interests and travelled a lot, but now she finds her activities closer to home. Titta, who once had an international career, maintains her language skills for example by reading German books and by watching German police TV series. She is also interested in documentaries on historical issues and different cultures. The case in Lahti is the only one with a single person with no children (another case, from Turku, depicts a divorced father of two). This is mentioned as a problem, since it has resulted in Titta having no relatives to look after her in her old age. Clearly, the move to sheltered housing was a decision that required some serious deliberation, even if “at the end of the day the decision about moving into a sheltered housing complex was easy.” The move seems to have had a great influence on Titta’s life. The second paragraph reports that her former life has been replaced by the current situation, and the third paragraph sharply contrasts “the past” and “now.” The interior world of Titta’s present appears passive and confined, whereas the outside world belongs to her past and is active in nature. This further emphasizes the drastic nature of the change as a replacement, and the divide between her former life outside sheltered housing and her current one inside. Both visual focalization and the narrator’s reports on Titta’s thoughts suggest the same experience of isolation and the relinquishment of former activities. Visual focalization invites the viewer to gradually share Titta’s point of view, and the verbal discourse by the narrator uses deictic markers attached to Titta’s present time. This blend of the narrator’s and character’s viewpoints provokes the ambiguity always present in fictional presentation: the two points of view present offer the reader two options that may be mutually exclusive but still equally possible (cf. Cohn 2000, 309). Does the feeling of being isolated in a cage, cut off from the previous world, stem from Titta’s experience or from the verbal and visual narrator? Is Titta dissatisfied with her situation or is she as an elderly single person perceived as an anomaly from an external point of view? This ethically sensitive question may be probed with concepts that Seymour Chatman (1990, 143) introduced to examine the nuances of focalization. The first concept, “slant,” includes the attitudes and ideological implications of the narrator reporting, and the second concept, “filter,” covers the mental activity of the character inside of the storyworld with her experiences, feelings, memories, and perceptions. Visual framing in the sense of a camera angle is a choice made by the visual narrator and part of the narrator’s slant.Therefore, the practice of opposing the outside and inside views from different sides of the window suggests that the narrator at least shares if not creates the feeling of isolation. Furthermore, the over-the-shoulder and the point-of-view shots of view do not align with Titta’s look. Therefore, they do not follow the character’s visual perception but suggest what she might see were she to look in the same direction as the camera. For this reason, the composition of the visual narration is dominated by the narrator’s choices, not by Titta’s perception of the world.
