- **The Role of the Protagonist:**
  - Protagonists are central characters who serve as the lens through which players, readers, or viewers experience the story.
  - They are responsible for creating or being subject to events that drive the plot forward, giving the narrative cohesion and purpose.

- **Character Traits and Complexity:**
  - Protagonists need not be conventionally likable or honorable but should have their unique code and loyalty to it.
  - Complex and flawed protagonists can be compelling due to their unique motivations and actions.
  - Change and character evolution, even if it doesn't lead to becoming "good," can add depth to a protagonist.

- **Making a Compelling Protagonist:**
  - Consider the player's perspective when creating a hero for a game.
  - Explore the protagonist's strengths, weaknesses, backstory, burdens, relationships, and purpose.
  - Conduct a Protagonist Survey to delve into granular psychological details, informing character development.

| Protagonist Survey  |                                   | 
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Which character?     | Dolly                             |
| What is their role? | Dolly is the main hero/protagonist |
| What makes them noble? | Dolly grew up a peasant, but fought in a war that saved her village from destruction. Warriors looked up to her as their new leader. |
| What makes them vulnerable? | Dolly has no family of her own; she was born an orphan, left for the villagers to take care of her. She finds herself often seized by moments of great isolation, even when surrounded by others; she’s reluctant to trust people, until they have proven themselves. She is rigid in her views of dignity, morality, and etiquette almost to a point where she is often prematurely intolerant or quick to judge. |
| What purpose do they have that is greater than themselves? | With no family of her own, Dolly views each citizen of her village as her family. She lives for them and will fight for them even if it leads to her own death. |
| What is a unique strength of this character? | She can summon the dead with spells; with an amulet she found in battle, she can increase her strength tenfold; she has the courage and savvy of ten men. |
| Why are they chosen? What makes them uniquely suited for this journey? | Upon the savage death of the village’s elder statesman, Dolly will seek revenge upon those who murdered this man, her father-figure. |


## THE ANTAGONIST
**Summary and Clarification:**
This passage discusses the importance of creating a compelling antagonist in storytelling and provides insights into developing such characters. It highlights the need to understand the antagonist's strengths, weaknesses, backstory, motivations, and their level of opposition to the protagonist. Four types of antagonists are described, along with the concept of the "unity of opposites" to ensure meaningful conflict.

- **Understanding the Antagonist:**
  - Similar to protagonists, antagonists require detailed development, including strengths, weaknesses, backstory, motivations, and relationships.
  - Antagonists may not necessarily be evil; their level of opposition to the protagonist determines their depth of antagonism.

- **Four Types of Antagonists:**
  - **The Evil Sadist:** A character born or driven by an inexplicable thirst for causing harm or chaos.
  - **The Obstacle:** Someone who obstructs the protagonist's progress, either sympathetically or indifferently.
  - **The Controller:** An antagonist with a thirst for power or wealth, often charismatic and motivating through fear.
  - **The Competitor:** Common in sports narratives, a character who competes with the protagonist, not necessarily evil but often arrogant.

- **Unity of Opposites:**
  - The concept of the "unity of opposites" emphasizes that conflict in storytelling arises from fundamental differences between the protagonist and antagonist, making compromise impossible.
  - This conflict is the driving force behind compelling stories.

- **Hannibal Lecter as an Example:** The passage clarifies that Hannibal Lecter, despite his gruesome acts, was not the antagonist in certain stories where he appeared. To be an antagonist, a character must pose a direct and meaningful obstacle to the protagonist.

**Key Idea:**
Creating a compelling antagonist involves understanding their character, motivations, and level of opposition to the protagonist. The "unity of opposites" concept highlights the need for deep-rooted differences between the two, driving the conflict that forms the core of engaging narratives.


## STOCK CHARACTERS 

**Summary and Clarification:**
This passage discusses the role of archetypes and stock characters in storytelling and how they can help shape supporting characters in fiction. It explains the concept of archetypes, which are enduring character figures rooted in storytelling history, and provides examples of various archetypes found in media. The passage also mentions stock characters, which are an expanded set of character types fulfilling predictable roles.

- **Archetypes in Storytelling:**
  - Archetypes are timeless character figures that have been present in storytelling for thousands of years.
  - Carl Jung's work contributed to the identification and understanding of archetypes in literature.
  - Examples of archetypes include the Wise Old Man, the Trickster, the Fair Maiden, the Nixie, the Mother, and the Child.
  
- **Stock Characters:**
  - Stock characters are an extended set of character types that serve predictable roles in storytelling.
  - Some stock characters have evolved with time and are still relevant in contemporary narratives.
  - Examples of stock characters include the superhero, supervillain, Harlequin (comic relief), and loyal sidekick.

- **Creating Great Characters:**
  - While archetypes and stock characters can serve as guides, the key to creating compelling characters is specificity.
  - Characters should be distinct in their personality and speech, making them easily distinguishable from others.
  - The essential question is whether the absence or presence of a character will impact the reader or viewer's investment in the story.

**Key Idea:**
Archetypes and stock characters are tools that can be used to create rich character universes in fiction, but the specificity of character traits and the reader/viewer's investment in the characters are paramount to successful storytelling.

| Jungian Archetypes |                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Archetype**                | **Role Example(s) in Media**     |
| Wise Old Man             | The person who provides knowledge and guidance to the protagonist and helps them transform into a hero. Example(s): Yoda (Star Wars franchise); Obi-Wan Kenobi (Star Wars franchise) |
| The Trickster            | A figure who is seemingly a friend or ally, but is mischievous and untrustworthy and is responsible for an event that puts the protagonist in harm’s way. Example(s): Lando Calrissian (The Empire Strikes Back); Little Finger (Game of Thrones) |
| The Fair Maiden          | A character that represents purity and virtue; often a love interest for the protagonist; often comes from regal stock; a common target for villains as a way to hurt the protagonist. (NOTE: While this character’s previous place in literature is culturally insensitive in this day and age, the role is no longer designated to young women only. Men too have assumed this role, though the numbers are still small.) Example(s): Princess Leia (Star Wars franchise); Kevin (Ghostbusters reboot) |
| The Nixie                | A seductress or seducer who lures people (often the protagonist or a close ally) into their lair and “sucks the life out of them.”* Example(s): Sirens (The Odyssey); Zora and Lora (God of War II); Queen of Pain (Dota 2) |
| The Mother               | A figure that is helpful, loving, and wise. Or, negatively, a figure that is secretive and dark. She devours and poisons those around her.† This character could have both positive and negative attributes. (The controlling, manipulative mother who is overly loving to her son and nasty to others is an overused archetype, but derives from these traits.) Positive Connotation: Mrs. Gump (Forrest Gump); Tala (Moana); Ramonda (Black Panther). Negative Connotation: Cersei Lannister (Game of Thrones); Norma Bates (Psycho); Marie Barone (Everybody Loves Raymond) |
| The Child                | A young character with a raw sense of emotion, almost a conduit to inexplicable, even magical or otherworldly events. He (or she) is “surrounded by unknown forces and must adjust himself to them as best as he can. Owing to this chronic state of his consciousness, it is often next to impossible to find out whether he merely dreamed something or whether he really experienced it.”‡ The Child is often not believed by adults in his/her interactions with the magical or otherworldly. The Child will also separate from his/her family to explore what these forces are either to adopt a new power or enhance the power he/she already has that enabled this connection in the first place. In some cases, the child might be kidnapped by these forces.§ Example(s): Will Byers (Stranger Things); Carol Anne Freeling (Poltergeist); Elliott (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial); Cole Sear (The Sixth Sense) |

## DIALOGUE

**Summary and Clarification:**
This passage explores the role of dialogue in storytelling, especially in the context of video games, where characters might not always have voice actors. It discusses the significance of dialogue in revealing character psychology, the challenges associated with writing effective dialogue for games, and provides guidelines for crafting compelling dialogue.

- **Importance of Dialogue:**
  - Dialogue is a vital tool for showcasing a character's personality and motivations.
  - How characters express themselves is as important as the content of their speech.

- **Challenges in Writing Game Dialogue:**
  - Games may use on-screen text instead of voice actors for dialogue.
  - Modern audiences have diverse expectations, making it challenging to define what constitutes "good" dialogue.
  - Character eccentricities can be a source of charm, even if they defy traditional dialogue rules.

- **Guidelines for Writing Good Dialogue:**
  - Authenticity: Dialogue should reflect a character's psychology, behavior, background, upbringing, social status, and backstory.
  - Less is more: Avoid overwriting; delete redundant lines.
  - Vitality: Dialogue should be energetic and engaging.
  - Distinction: Each character should have a distinct voice.
  - Power status: The psychological power dynamic between characters influences their dialogue.
  - Subtext: Unspoken subtext adds depth to characters and scenes.
  - "Show, not tell": Allow character actions and behavior to reveal emotions and plot elements.
  - Challenges of writing for games: Dialogue may be recorded in isolation, requiring supplemental materials like tone documents and character bios.

**Key Idea:**
Dialogue is a powerful tool for revealing character traits and advancing the story, but it comes with challenges, especially in the context of video games. Effective dialogue should be authentic, concise, lively, distinct for each character, and mindful of power dynamics, while also incorporating subtext to add depth to the narrative.

|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What’s the name of this world?         | Piedmont                                                                            |
| Where is it?                            | A town somewhere in New England; state unknown                                    |
| How many people live there?             | 508. It’s rural                                                                    |
| What kind of people live there?         | 60% is made up of Army veterans; most are out of work and rely on the bottle to get through the day; 20% is Native American, as there’s a reservation nearby and a casino not far away; the remaining 20% of Piedmont is a biker gang, who sells illegal firearms to subsidize the empire of their brotherhood |
| Name an historical event that happened there in the past 20 years. | A senator was killed in a mysterious car accident that some have suggested was engineered by the biker gang out of revenge for his supporting new Federal funding to the ATF (American Tobacco and Firearms) |
| What’s the climate of this world?         | Long winters. It snows starting in early October and ends in early May. The town experiences subzero temperatures during this time, along with heavy snowfall and limited hours of light. The summers are extremely humid. Moderate temperatures in May and September |
| What’s the world look like?              | Working class town with high unemployment. Biggest employers are the casino 10 miles away and the ValleyMart, a huge discount department store. Lots of trailer parks. Houses have acres of space between one another. The woods are thick, filled with heavy streams but barren trees. Lots of RVs on abandoned streets. People do not pick up after themselves. It’s a third world town inside of a first world country |
| How do the people in the neighboring worlds feel about it? | No respect for Piedmont. As far others can tell, this is a barren wasteland. If you’re not drowning your sorrows at the local saloon, you’re tattooing your flesh to celebrate your gang |
| Who runs this world?                    | Derrick Ambrose, the leader of the Devil Spawn Biker gang. He is the most feared man in the state, but as long as you keep to yourself, you won’t have any trouble |
| How is this world run?                   | Gangland rules. No snitches, no stiches. As long as you let the Devil Spawn gang do as they please, you’ll be fine. But if you cross them, your days are numbered |
| Are there any rivalries in this world?   | Rival gangs occasionally drive through here, but at great risk. Recently, the Mafia set up shop in order to invest in the nearby casino |
| Are there any intruders or threats to this world? | The Mafia and undercover ATF agents, who track the activities of the gang |
| What’s the most recent event that set the world into chaos? | The sister of an Army vet was killed at a local bar. Her boyfriend, a gang member of the Devil Spawn, fled the town |
| Is the status quo of this world being threatened? If so, how? | Yes. The Army vet is investigating what happened. Denied by the police because they don’t want to cross the Devil Spawn, the Army vet has taken to arms to exact revenge on this gang, even joining forces with the Mafia to take them down |
| Is there an event that the world is preparing for or responding to? | A massive snowstorm has cut the power supply off to the town. Everyone is living without electricity for the indefinite future. The roads are too dangerous to travel on |
| Will this world survive in five years?    | No. It is on the verge of moral collapse if the gang cannot rise from the cover up of the death of the Army vet’s sister. Alternatively, the Mafia might take it over if they see a town in turmoil with crumbling leadership |

**Key Idea:**
Creating distinct and memorable game worlds, treated as characters with their own profiles and tensions, is essential for a game's success and its potential to extend beyond the gaming medium. This involves a balance between physical details and narrative elements.

# Chapter 7 ◾ Meaningful Choice, Branching Narrative, and Downstream Effects

## Meaningful Choice in Game Narrative

**Summary and Clarification:**
  - **Concept of Meaningful Choice:** In game narrative, meaningful choice is a proactive force that stems from an interactive dialogue exchange between the player and the non-playable character (NPC).
  - **Purpose and Outcome:** This interaction offers the game's development team a means to provide story context and rewards the player with incentives such as experience points, gear, or ability-enhancing tools or weapons after completing a dialogue exchange.
  - **Quality of Narrative Design:** A well-designed narrative ensures that no matter the choices presented, each option offers unique content to encourage replayability. This often leads to branching narratives where player choices directly impact story outcomes.

**Key Idea:** 
   - Meaningful choices in game narratives empower players with a sense of agency, where their decisions can mold the story's direction and outcome, making gameplay more engaging and immersive.

## Branching Narrative

**Summary and Clarification:**
  - **Definition:** Branching narrative is a storytelling technique where the player's choices determine different story outcomes.
  - **Comparison:** This method is likened to “Choose Your Own Adventure” books where decision points guide the story.
  - **Visual Representation:** Branching narratives can be visualized as a tree with numerous branches, symbolizing the myriad potential story directions based on player choices.
  - **Gameplay Implications:** Choices lead to downstream effects, impacting future dialogues and scenarios. This allows for varied gameplay experiences based on earlier choices.

**Key Idea:** 
   - Branching narratives offer players a dynamic storytelling experience where their actions dictate the narrative’s direction, fostering deeper engagement and personalized gameplay.

## Downstream Effects of Choices

**Summary and Clarification:**
  - **Effect of Choices:** The decisions made by players initiate a chain reaction, impacting future interactions and shaping the game's narrative.
  - **Character Interaction:** Depending on the player's choice, NPCs can respond in ways that align with the set tone, potentially offering or withholding information, clues, or opportunities.
  - **Narrative Branching Rules:** For a choice to be effective, it should lead to different outcomes, advance the plot, and/or give deeper insight into the game world or characters.

**Key Idea:** 
   - Every choice in the game has downstream consequences, emphasizing the significance of player decisions and enriching the narrative depth.

## Dialogue as a Mechanism for Meaningful Choice

**Summary and Clarification:**
  - **Dialogue Importance:** Engaging with NPCs through dialogue is a crucial way players make meaningful choices, determining various outcomes.
  - **Provided Example:** A scenario is depicted where a player's response to an NPC can lead to different outcomes—be it progression, conflict, or acquiring more information.
  - **Conditional Statements:** At its core, the interactive dialogue system operates on a basic “If this, then that” premise, outlining the potential outcomes of each player choice.

**Key Idea:** 
   - Dialogues serve as interactive bridges in the narrative, where every response can unveil a distinct path, reinforcing the essence of meaningful choices in gameplay.

## Branching Narrative in Gaming

**Summary and Clarification:**
  - **Concept of Choices**: Players in games, especially RPGs, often encounter narrative choices that branch out to different paths, each leading to a different outcome or experience. Each choice usually offers a distinct tone, character status, or point of view, enriching the narrative.
  - **Replayability and Depth**: A primary goal of branching narratives is to encourage players to replay the game, exploring various choices and experiencing different outcomes. The richness and depth of these choices help classify a game as either a true RPG or one with light RPG elements.
  - **Converging Paths**: Different narrative branches can sometimes converge or dovetail to the same story milestones. This approach can be due to budget constraints but can also be a narrative device to revisit significant events from different perspectives.
  - **Meaningful Choices**: Choices in a game should provide sufficiently distinct content. If two paths lead to similar or near-identical outcomes, the choices may seem inconsequential or cosmetic to the player.
  - **Character Perspectives**: Different character perspectives can significantly influence the narrative. For example, a crime scene observed by a detective may offer a completely different narrative experience when seen through the eyes of a young witness.

**Key Idea:**
- Effective branching narratives in games provide meaningful choices that enrich the story, drive replayability, and offer unique experiences based on character perspectives.

## Meaningful Choices and Their Effects

**Summary and Clarification:**
  - **Depth of Choice**: The choices presented should provide varied experiences and not just cosmetic differences. For instance, being given a gun or a knife as a result of a choice is cosmetic, whereas experiencing a crime scene from different perspectives offers depth.
  - **Differentiated Content**: Branching narratives should aim to provide distinct content in each branch, ensuring each choice feels meaningful and enriches the player's experience.
  - **Limitations and Cost-effectiveness**: Game developers might be limited by budgets, which can influence the extent of branching. A cost-effective method to offer variety is to provide different perspectives or personalities from the same character.
  - **Complexity vs. Simplicity**: Branching narrative development can be intricate and time-consuming. Striking a balance is crucial; too complex narratives might overwhelm some players, while too simplistic ones might seem unengaging.

![[Pasted image 20230918090253.png]]

**Key Idea:**
- Achieving a balance in branching narratives is crucial; choices should offer meaningful, varied experiences without overwhelming the player with complexity.

## Game Development and Narrative Design

**Summary and Clarification:**
  - **Commitment to Branching**: Developing a branching narrative requires significant time and resources. An extensive writing staff might be needed to achieve multiple varied paths.
  - **Replayability as a Promise**: Game companies often promote replayability as a feature, and branching narratives can help fulfill this promise to players.
  - **Average Player Considerations**: Not all players seek intricate branching narratives. Game developers should consider the average player who might prefer less narrative friction and a more streamlined experience.
  - **Ideal Middle Ground**: Light branching, especially when introducing new gameplay moments, can be a middle ground, providing depth without overwhelming complexity.

![[Pasted image 20230918090316.png]]


**Key Idea:**
- To cater to a wide range of players, game developers should consider a balanced approach to branching narratives, ensuring depth and variety without excessive complexity.


# Chapter 8 ◾ Analysis of Narrative in Contemporary Games

## Criteria of Well-Told Narrative in Games

**Summary and Clarification:**
- **Story Milestones:** Milestones within the game should be exciting and/or compelling.
- **Character Development:** The growth of characters should feel organic and gradual.
- **Relationship with Gameplay:** The narrative should either be intertwined with the gameplay or be independent. If independent, the extent to which should be clear. Actions in the narrative should influence gameplay and vice versa.
- **Narrative Friction:** The narrative should not constantly interrupt gameplay, especially if the story is not engaging.

- **Emotional Investment:** Players should feel emotionally connected to the story and characters. The narrative should evoke genuine emotion, not just functional loss.

**Key Idea:** A well-told game narrative seamlessly blends with gameplay, evokes genuine emotion, and has consistent pacing and tone.

## Emotional Investment in NPCs

**Summary and Clarification:**
- **NPCs as Functional Devices:** Often, NPCs serve purely functional roles such as providing information, healing, equipping, or assisting in combat. This design can lead to players seeing NPCs merely as tools.
- **Seeking Deeper Emotional Connections:** Some games, like Fable II and The Last of Us, manage to build deeper emotional connections with NPCs, making their loss or absence genuinely saddening.
- **Character Importance:** A character's role should be about making the gaming experience meaningful. Their presence should bring joy, and their absence, sorrow.

**Key Idea:** To elevate the gaming experience, NPCs should be more than just functional devices; they should evoke genuine emotion in players.

## Challenges in Telling Emotional Stories in Games

**Summary and Clarification:**
- **Games vs. Traditional Art:** Games often focus on fast-paced, dopamine-releasing activities, while traditional art forms like theater or museums offer slow, reflective experiences.
- **Consumer Expectations:** Players typically seek fun and instant gratification from games rather than deep emotional experiences.
- **Developers' Exposure:** Game creators, often having grown up on games, might lack exposure to emotionally rich media, leading to games with superficial narratives.
- **Limited Inspirational Pool:** Many developers reference a narrow range of stories or genres, which can result in clichéd narratives.
- **Involvement of Narrative Designers:** Writers and narrative designers should be involved early in the game development process due to their experience with fiction-driven media.

**Key Idea:** The fast-paced nature of games, consumer expectations, and limited exposure of developers to emotionally rich narratives are challenges in delivering emotional stories in games.

## Importance of Rich Storytelling

**Summary and Clarification:**
- **Popular References:** Franchises like Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and The Lord of the Rings are common references, but they shouldn't be the only sources of inspiration.
- **Emotion in Major IPs:** While these franchises have rich worlds and characters, the emotional moments between characters can sometimes be overshadowed by action.
- **Involving Narrative Experts:** Having narrative experts in the early phases of game development can help integrate genuine emotional moments into the narrative.

**Key Idea:** For a rich game narrative, developers should broaden their pool of inspirations and involve narrative experts early in the development process.

## Game Narrative Breakdown Examples

**Summary and Clarification:**
- **Criteria for Analysis:** The games chosen for analysis are assessed based on story milestones, character and world-building components, and emotional touchpoints.
- **Varying Quality:** Among the selected games, one stands out as a narrative masterpiece, while the other is viewed as a misfire influenced by Hollywood storytelling.
