> **00 - TOC** *(Theory of Composition)* -  Introduces a myriad of theories, models, and philosophies surrounding narrative and story. Using these tenets of story, the goal is to distill and craft my own theory of composition.

*Narratologically - **Research and Application** belong here as well.*


# Theory of Composition - Body of Knowledge

## 001_The Theory of Literature 

*Literature forms the core foundation of my composition theory. From a post-modern viewpoint, all forms of art are seen as derivatives of language, a concept that stems from literary criticism. Therefore, whenever my composition theory encounters a challenge or issue, it should first seek answers within literature before exploring other mediums incorporated within the theory of composition.*

### 001_Narratology - BAL, MIEKE
Great book that can serve as the basis of creating my Theory of Composition. 
*Very in depth when it comes to Narratology. It may be best to have Narratology as the basis for my theory*








## 002_The Craft of Writing Literature

*My composition theory seeks to address the methods of composition, an area often overlooked by narrative theory and literary studies. The aura of mystique surrounding literary writing often stems from authors who base their success on the quantity of their works, rather than the depth of their insights. This sentiment echoes the ideas of Harold Bloom's School of Resentment, summarized as "authors are published because they've been published." *

*Regrettably, writers developing their unique writing systems must discern truths that often originate from compromised sources. The skill and principles that govern "high art," especially in literature, involves concealing these truths and placing power in resentment rather than mastery. This has led to an elitist academic environment that determines and disseminates what is deemed "literature."*

*Through an extensive review of existing literature on the art of writing, my goal is to unravel and shed light on the obscured art of storytelling. This is an effort to challenge the barriers established by opportunistic writers who hide behind exclusivity, be it through financial gatekeeping or the façade of advanced academia.*

### 002_The Writer's Compass - DODD, NANCY ELLEN
Dodd's book primarily delves into the less-explored aspects of mainstream narrative components that authors frequently overlook. Her meticulous attention to detail and clear writing style make it easier for readers to grasp her insights and incorporate them into a broader writing framework.
*My main glean from Dodd is her delve into the process of writing for the writer themselves. If I have trouble in the meta, I should turn to her first.*
[00_The Writer's Compass](obsidian://open?vault=STORY%20DEVELOPMENT%20TEMPLATE&file=00_TOC%2F00_DODD%2F00_The%20Writer's%20Compass%20-%20Dodd%2C%20Nancy%20Ellen)
### 002_The Complete Handbook of Novel Writing - READER'S DIGEST 
The book, authored by the editors of Reader's Digest, aims to offer a comprehensive guide to novel writing for budding writers. Although it may fall short in offering in-depth analysis or high-quality content in some areas, it compensates by covering a wide range of topics pertinent to the craft. Notably, the last chapters stand out as a precious resource, where renowned authors share solutions to common challenges that many writers face. Their perspectives, honed through years of experience, offer deep and tangible insights invaluable to individuals devoted to mastering the art of writing.
*The Handbook certainly presents an intriguing approach. In my view, it serves better as a 'Troubleshooter' or a tool to cover various aspects of storytelling components comprehensively, rather than acting as a comprehensive foundation of literary theory. It seems more apt as a quick reference guide to have at your side rather than a substantive teaching resource.
Unfortunately, the quality of the content in many chapters leaves much to be desired. It appears that several contributors have not invested sufficient effort in providing substantial information in their sections. Instead, they seem to exploit this platform to direct readers to their social media pages, which is quite disappointing.
In my opinion, this kind of approach from authors, who seem more focused on promoting their personal brand and financial gains rather than advancing the art of literature, is seriously undermining the essence of literary craftsmanship. It brings to mind David Foster Wallace's critique of the prevalent culture of 'excessive entertainment,' where the genuine nourishment of literature is being overshadowed by a more self-serving approach to writing.*

## 003_Film & Television 

*Over the past century, film and television have become the predominant mediums for storytelling. As a result, the storytelling principles, genres, and conventions presented through these mediums have deeply embedded themselves in both audiences and writers. My personal influences as a writer come significantly from the exposure I had to film and television, both during my childhood and in my professional journey. Thus, incorporating literature that delves into the theory and craft of screenwriting is crucial for formulating a comprehensive theory of composition.*

### 003_Story Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting - MCKEE, ROBERT
During my late teenage years, I immersed myself in studying McKee's renowned narrative and storytelling techniques. This educational journey emerged as perhaps the most significant influence from any resources found in my 'Theory of Composition Body of Knowledge' (TOCBOK). McKee's teachings, which prominently feature the concept of dualism, profoundly shaped my understanding of the vital role dualism plays in crafting a captivating story.
*While McKee's brilliance cannot be denied, it is both his strength and weakness. He passionately shares profound insights, albeit in a manner that can sometimes lack a structured and practical approach essential for actual writing. Nevertheless, his brilliant ideas serve as invaluable references, complementing more structured and methodical storytelling theories and frameworks.*
[00_Story Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting](obsidian://open?vault=STORY%20DEVELOPMENT%20TEMPLATE&file=00_TOC%2F00_MCKEE%2F00_Story%20-%20MCKEE%2C%20ROBERT)

### 003_Dramataica - PHILLIPS, MELANIE ANNE & HUNTLEY, CHRIS 
Dramatica is a storytelling model that places a strong emphasis on structure, using it as the foundation around which all other narrative elements, ranging from the overarching themes and universe to the character's actions and decisions, are built.
*Dramatica is a sophisticated and potent storytelling framework known for its capacity to create grand narratives. This model offers both the freedom of spontaneous writing and the security of structured planning. While it has its limitations, relying solely on the Dramatica structure for a story can be a valuable exercise. Ideally, using the theory's methodology to establish intricate nested structures for each story is a more effective approach. In my opinion, Dramatica serves as a fundamental foundation, potentially the starting point for rigorous story development.*

## 004_Theatre 

*During my teenage years, theatre was a significant aspect of my life; I worked as a lighting designer and stagehand. Later, my friend Colin pursued dramaturgy and consistently shared insights with me about the nuances of stage storytelling. Distinct from literature and, to some degree, film, theatre often presents a more established set of storytelling principles. These principles often transcend the realm of theatre. Theatre has broadened my perspective on composition, introducing me to concepts like intertextuality and hypermediation. These ideas, moving from theoretical to practical application, provide a robust foundation for a comprehensive theory of storytelling.*

### 004_The Architecture of Story by DUNNE, WILL
A uniquely theatre based structure of story. There are many similarities that are intertextualized between mediums and concepts that are uniquely rooted within theatre itself.  Style and Dramatic Focus are two forms of story that are approached differently and could prove useful in forming a transmedia form of storytelling. 
*The most interesting concept that Dunne delves into concern the topic of Magical Realism. I know that I've had issues regarding flexible chronologies, timelines, and shared imaginations, and Dunne seems to provide a decent introduction to such things*

## 005_Video Game & Transmedia

*Film and television were the predominant entertainment mediums of the past century. However, in recent times, video games, short-form content, and transmedia narratives have emerged as the leading and most lucrative storytelling platforms. It's crucial to develop a theory that not only integrates these contemporary trends but also possesses a flexible structure, accommodating the introduction and phasing out of various storytelling mediums within the composition framework.*

### 005_Dramatic Storytelling & Narrative Design - BERGER, ROSS
An interesting introduction to Transmedia in the realm of Video Games. What I Wanted to glean from this book is how transmedia can be applied to literature. The most important takes from this book are the broadest of strokes. 
*I believe the best lessons I learned from this is to prepare for growth by having good documentation. Good documentation IE: an Obsidian notebook with the development notes available to those in different industries. This will empower those in other industries to understand the meat under the bikini so to speak.*

## 006_Tabletop Roleplaying Games 

*Tabletop roleplaying games laid the foundation for video games. Setting aside the technological facets of video games, many of their design principles stem from tabletop roleplaying traditions. Unlike video games, tabletop games promote a collaborative storytelling approach among participants, as opposed to the conventional artist-viewer dynamic. My goal is to distill the intricacies of rule designs from tabletop roleplaying games—rules that are intricate yet clear enough for a group to grasp and co-create a shared narrative.*

### 006_Complete Kobold Guide - BOUR, WOLFGANG
Bour's writings offer a comprehensive insight into the intricacies of creating a tabletop role-playing game, encompassing the procedures, interactions, and challenges involved. What particularly intrigues me about this book is its focus on narrative design—specifically, the systematic approach to worldbuilding and the tenets of collaborative storytelling in tabletop role-playing game sessions.
*The book primarily delves into the design of tabletop games, making it a dense read. Yet, the unique insights on organizational strategies, the integration of dice rolling and unpredictability, and the detailed design principles stand out as invaluable information, unmatched in any other storytelling medium.*




## 007_Artificial Intelligence
