- **Effective Use:** Employing metaphors and similes can assist in "showing" a story. They create richer meanings and make stories more visual.
- **Illustrative Comparison:** The difference between "showing" and "telling" is exemplified by two sentences about Josh. The first "tells" an event, while the second "shows" how it happened visually.
- **Engaging the Senses:** Enhancing visualization through the senses creates a richer narrative. However, it's essential to be selective in detailing to avoid overwhelming readers.
- **Examples from Literary Works:** Several excerpts from novels such as "My Antonia" and "The Hound of the Baskervilles" demonstrate the art of "showing" and "telling," elucidating the concept with concrete instances.

- **Examples from "Tom Jones"**: In "The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling" by Henry Fielding, the author frequently intrudes to explain the story or comment on the actions of the characters.
- **Modern Approaches**: In contemporary literature, author intrusion has become subtler, with authors inserting information that the character may not know, sometimes potentially alienating readers if it doesn't feel organic to the story.
- **Potential Downfalls**: Such intrusion can risk disenchanting the reader, particularly if it introduces the author's personal world view or political agenda overtly, as seen in the original version of the movie "The Abyss".

#### **Key Idea:**
Author intrusion, a prevalent narrative technique in the past, has evolved to become subtler in modern times, yet retains its ability to potentially alienate readers if not handled judiciously.

The choice between showing and telling scenes is crucial in storytelling, necessitating a careful consideration of narrative impact, changing standards, and audience preferences to craft a compelling and inclusive story.

- **Audience Expectations:** If certain elements, like a gun, are introduced in a scene, there's an expectation it will be used, creating tension that must be fulfilled.
- **Novels vs. Plays/Screenplays:** Unlike plays or screenplays, novels and short stories require more descriptive detail since readers can't see a visual representation.
- **Influence of Readers' Experiences:** Authors should be careful with details, relying on readers' experiences to help visualize scenes but providing necessary clarifications when needed.

**Key Idea:** Details in writing should be purposeful and meaningful, contributing to the story's development and resonating with the readers' experiences and expectations.

**What Did You Choose to Tell?**

- **Show vs. Tell:** There are moments when a story can be told rather than shown, especially if going into detail might disrupt the story's pace or essence.
- **Impact on Characters:** Sometimes, depicting a character's reactions or retelling of an event can be more impactful than directly showcasing the event.

- **The Role of Editors:** While the author might have expertise, they can still benefit from external editing to catch mistakes or improve structure.
- **Variety in Editing:** Editors have different approaches, some focusing on grammar (line editing) while others critique the story's core elements. Many offer a combination of both.
- **Choosing the Right Editor:** It’s crucial to select an editor familiar with your genre, reviewing their work samples and discussing their approach to ensure a good fit.
- **Payment and Expectations:** Understand the editor's fees, whether they charge per page or project, and clarify deliverables. Typically, partial payment is made upfront.
- **Receiving Feedback:** Authors must differentiate between genuine improvement suggestions and changes that alter the story’s voice. It's crucial to remain objective and consider each recommendation.

**Key Idea:** 
Getting feedback and hiring the right editor are pivotal steps in refining a manuscript, but the final decision on changes rests with the author, who should balance feedback with preserving their unique voice.

**Disagreeing with an Editor**

**Summary and Clarification:**
- **Editors are Fallible:** Just like authors, editors can make mistakes or let their preferences influence their feedback.
- **Voice Preservation:** Sometimes, editors might suggest changes that alter the original voice or tone of the work, which might not be in the author's best interest.
- **Decisions on Feedback:** Authors should consider if the editor’s feedback corrects genuine mistakes, clarifies the content, changes the original voice, or truly enhances the story.
- **Trust Your Instincts:** While it's essential to be open to feedback, authors should also trust their gut feelings about changes, especially if they feel a suggestion doesn’t improve the narrative.
- **Objective Evaluation:** If frequently disagreeing with an editor, the author should introspect to understand if they're too attached to their work or if they perhaps chose the wrong editor.

**Key Idea:** 
While editors provide valuable insights, authors must critically evaluate each suggestion to ensure that their original voice and story intent remain intact.
