# PART 1 - THE WRITER AND THE ART OF STORY
## INTRODUCTION 

**Summary and Interpretation**

- **Introduction**
    - **Story Principles vs. Rules**: A great story is grounded in time-tested principles rather than rigid rules. While beginners might stick strictly to rules and rebels might break them, true artists understand and master the foundational principles.
  
    - **Universal Forms vs. Formulas**: Genuine storytelling doesn't rely on repetitive formulas but is rooted in universal patterns and truths. Emphasizing originality, it is urged that storytellers should dive deep into the core tenets of their art.

    - **Archetypes vs. Stereotypes**: A powerful story taps into universal human experiences (archetypes) rather than resorting to overused clichés (stereotypes). Such stories resonate across cultures, transporting audiences to unique worlds where they see reflections of their own humanity. 

    - **Thoroughness vs. Shortcuts**: Genuine storytelling requires commitment and depth. While the essence of storytelling is open for all to grasp, mastery lies in thoroughness and authenticity, not taking shortcuts.

    - **Mastering Art vs. Market Trends**: Storytellers should focus on perfecting their craft rather than trying to predict market trends. Quality and refined work stand out and maintain their integrity.

    - **Respect vs. Disdain for the Audience**: Talented writers who respect their audiences aim to genuinely connect with them. Recognizing the intelligence and sensitivity of audiences is crucial. A story should balance the vision of the storyteller with the expectations and desires of the audience.

    - **Originality vs. Duplication**: True storytelling is about having a unique voice and perspective. If the core message is clichéd, the delivery will also be. Originality should be genuine, not forced eccentricity or gimmickry. Great storytellers are recognized by their unique style which reflects their worldview. They stand out because of their distinct content and style.

In essence, the art of storytelling is a balance between understanding timeless principles and introducing originality. Respecting the audience, being thorough in the craft, and valuing archetypal narratives over stereotypical ones are all central to creating compelling stories.
## 1 THE STORY PROBLEM

### 1. The Issue with Modern Storytelling
#### The Deterioration of Narrative Quality
- **Original Inquiry of Human Existence**
    - Daily, we ponder over the profound question that Aristotle once asked in his works, "Ethics":
        - "What is the appropriate way for a human to live?"
        - Unfortunately, we have not yet found a definite answer.
- **Entertainment Through Stories**
    - Truly engaging stories provide not only intellectual but also emotional satisfaction.
    - Exceptional movies, books, and dramas, regardless of their tone, offer audiences a renewed perception of life infused with deep sentiment.
- **Role of Storytelling**
    - Storytelling is not an escape from reality; instead, it aids us in our quest to understand the true essence of existence.
    - Although technology allows us to disseminate stories globally, the essence of storytelling is diminishing.
    - Many stories have lost their depth, relying more on visual grandeur rather than substantive narratives, leaning more towards deception rather than truth.
    - Insipid narratives now gravitate towards being expensive showcases rather than genuine tales.
    - Various film industries are focusing more on enhancing visuals, losing the genuine essence of storytelling, and sometimes appearing rather grotesque.
    - For a culture to flourish, it requires genuine and potent narratives.
    - Continuous exposure to superficial stories leads to a decline in societal values.
    - In contrast, filmmakers in Asia continue to produce remarkable narratives.

#### The Disappearance of Expertise
- **Dominance of Story and Film**
    - The art of creating stories holds a prominent place in the cultural sphere, with film being the most influential medium.
- **Lack of Skills Among Emerging Writers**
    - Many aspiring writers dive into writing without fully understanding the nuances of the craft.
    - The knowledge they acquire from reading and studying is substantial, possibly more significant than personal experiences, especially if they fail to introspect on those experiences.
    - Deep introspection on personal reactions to life events is crucial.
    - Beginner writers often confuse their subconscious assimilation of narrative elements from consumed media as skill or instinct, which is restricting and merely habitual.
    - There's a shift in teaching methodologies for creative writing in American universities, moving from intrinsic elements to focusing more on language structures and texts.
    - The current cohort of writers lacks education in the fundamental principles of storytelling.
    - Core values, which form the essence of this art form, are witnessing a decline, impacting the quality of storytelling.

#### The Essential Nature of Story
- **Effort in Designing Stories**
    - A significant portion of a writer's effort in creating a work goes into constructing the story, requiring a balance of vivid imagination and strong analytical thinking.
- **Understanding Story Structure**
    - To excel in writing, one needs to understand and utilize the basic structure of storytelling effectively.

#### Crafting a Captivating Story
- **Elements of a Good Story**
    - Creating a compelling story involves presenting something worth narrating, which the audience desires to hear, combined with a deep understanding of your characters and your envisioned world.
- **Love for Various Aspects of Storytelling**
    - The process involves nurturing a love for various facets like the art of storytelling, truth-seeking, empathy towards humanity, indulging in sensations, cherishing humor, appreciating language, understanding duality, seeking perfection, valuing uniqueness, and maintaining self-belief.
- **Techniques for Crafting a Good Story**
    - Crafting involves using various techniques to engage the audience deeply and provide them with a touching and meaningful experience.
    - Craftsmanship is not about gimmicks but understanding the rhythm of a writer's day, balancing creativity and critique to improve the narrative.
    - Mastery in craft allows the subconscious to flow freely, aiding in creating a balanced narrative.

#### Story in Relation to Life
- **Portraying Reality in Story**
    - While creating personal narratives, writers should strive to find the underlying truth rather than just portraying a semblance of reality.
- **The Role of Truth and Facts in Story**
    - A compelling story serves as a metaphor for life, abstracting the essences from life without losing the depth and meaning found in real-life experiences.
    - Writers need to recognize that mere facts or abstractions are not sufficient to create a meaningful story.
    - Real storytelling delves deeper, trying to find the underlying truth and essence in the events, beyond mere facts.

#### Abilities and Gifts of Writers
- **Strengths in Different Writers**
    - Writers, whether focusing on portraying reality or creating action-packed narratives, possess distinct strengths, which when combined, can create a balanced and strong narrative.
    - Writing requires a harmonious blend of sensitivity to sensory perceptions and a vibrant imagination.
    - Writers need to have both literary talent, to elevate language, and story talent, to convey life experiences in a more potent and meaningful manner.

#### Maximizing Talent Through Craft
- **Importance of Craft in Storytelling**
    - Crafting a story brilliantly, even if it portrays trivial material, can captivate an audience more than a poorly told profound narrative.
    - Craft helps in enhancing story talent, without which, even the most potent stories can lose their impact and effectiveness.


# PART 2 - THE ELEMENTS OF STORY

## 2 THE STRUCTURE SPECTRUM
### STORY DESIGN TERMINOLOGY

- Every character's life offers endless storytelling possibilities. A skilled storyteller can choose just a few moments and paint a complete lifetime.
- The expansive life journey must be condensed into a concise narrative.
- Often, the narrative told encapsulates the entire life journey of a character.

### STRUCTURE

- Movies are more than just random moments or activities; they need substance and meaning.
- Writers look for impactful events, which encompass emotion, conflict, dialogue, and setting, to drive the story.
- Structure involves choosing key events from characters' lives and organizing them in a way that evokes certain emotions and communicates a specific perspective on life.
- Events must be strategically chosen and structured in a manner similar to composing music.
- A clear purpose is necessary when deciding on which events to include or exclude.
- Crafting a sequence of events requires a two-tiered approach.

### ELEMENTS OF STORY STRUCTURE:

#### Event
- An "event" signifies a significant change.
- Story events have to be meaningful, impacting characters in a profound way.
- A story event introduces a notable change in a character's situation, related to a universal value.
- To make the change resonate, it must be portrayed in relation to a value, prompting audience reactions.
- Story values, such as love/hate or alive/dead, are fundamental contrasts that form the heart of storytelling.
- Random coincidences don't make a solid story foundation; events must be driven by value and conflict.

#### Scene
- A scene depicts an evolving situation through continuous action and conflict, resulting in a significant value shift in a character's life.
- Writers should assess their scenes based on the values at stake and the evolution of these values from start to finish.
- Scenes with no value change are considered uneventful and might only serve as mere exposition.
- Every scene should ideally shift a value, either from positive to negative or vice versa.
- Different genres focus on varying value aspects; the essence remains the same: non-impactful scenes should be removed.

#### Beat
- Beats are the smallest structural units within a scene.
- A beat involves an exchange of actions and reactions that together shape the scene.
- The "lovers break up" scene, for instance, consists of several beats, each presenting a different interaction dynamic.

#### Sequence
- Scenes create sequences.
- Sequences are made of multiple scenes that culminate in an impactful climax.
- Sequences should be titled for clarity, encapsulating their main objective.

#### Act
- Sequences form acts.
- Acts depict significant value reversals in a character's life, with the climax having a greater impact than previous sequences or scenes.
  
#### Story
- Acts come together to form the overall story.
- The story traces the overarching shift in a character's situation from start to finish.
- Changes brought about by scenes, sequences, or acts can potentially be reversible. However, the story's climax must introduce an absolute, unchangeable transformation.
- The entire narrative structure, from beats to the story climax, should serve the story's deeper purpose.

### THE STORY TRIANGLE

1. **Plot and its Importance**:
    - Plot represents a consistent and interrelated series of events moving through time.
    - The act of plotting means selecting the right course of events for a story, ensuring they make sense and create a cohesive narrative.
    - Novelists, unlike screenwriters, can delve deeply into a character's thoughts, giving insights into their inner world.
    - Movies, on the other hand, require converting mental aspects to tangible or visual representations, making them more challenging.
    - The plot is not about unnecessary twists or overly dramatic scenes but about carefully selecting events and revealing them over time.
    - Hence, every story, regardless of its form, has a plot.

2. **Types of Plots**:
   - **Archplot (Classical Design)**: Adheres to timeless principles making it relatable across cultures and times. It focuses on:
        - Active protagonist.
        - External conflicts.
        - Causality and logical progression.
        - Linear time.
        - Consistent reality.
        - Closed endings.

   - **Miniplot (Minimalism)**: Scaled down version of classical design but still demands perfection in execution. It may feature:
        - Open endings.
        - Internal conflicts.
        - Multiple protagonists.
        - A passive protagonist.

   - **Antiplot**: Contradicts traditional story forms, possibly making a mockery of them. Elements might include:
        - Coincidences.
        - Nonlinear time.
        - Inconsistent realities.

### FORMAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE STORY TRIANGLE

1. **Closed vs. Open Endings**:
    - Archplot provides closure to all story threads.
    - Miniplot may leave some unanswered questions, pushing the audience to ponder.

2. **External vs. Internal Conflict**:
    - Archplot stresses outward conflicts while Miniplot delves into inner struggles.

3. **Single vs. Multiple Protagonists**:
    - Archplot typically has one central character, whereas Miniplot might use multiple.

4. **Active vs. Passive Protagonist**:
    - Archplot’s protagonist is dynamic and active, while Miniplot’s is more passive and reactive.

5. **Linear vs. Nonlinear Time**:
    - Archplot has a clear chronological order, but Antiplot disarranges this order.

6. **Causality vs. Coincidence**:
    - Archplot relies on cause-effect chains giving meaning to events, while Antiplot might use random occurrences breaking these chains.

7. **Consistent vs. Inconsistent Realities**:
    - Archplot maintains a consistent world with set rules. Even in fantasy, these rules are followed. Antiplot, however, breaks these rules to portray a sense of absurdity.

8. **Change vs. Stasis**:
    - In the top part of the triangle (combining Archplot and Miniplot), characters undergo changes. Below this, in Nonplot, characters remain static.

This overview essentially categorizes different approaches to storytelling, providing a comprehensive toolset for writers to determine the form and structure best suited to their narrative vision. The described triangle acts as a framework guiding the type and structure of storytelling, giving a bird's-eye view of the expansive universe of stories.

Certainly, this passage is a rich exploration into the dynamics between politics and story design, touching on the challenges, motivations, and responsibilities of a fiction writer. Here's a detailed breakdown and summary for you:

This passage discusses the intersection of art and politics in the context of storytelling, emphasizing the importance of understanding and mastering classical story forms while staying true to one's beliefs as a writer.

### The Politics of Story Design
**The Politics of Story Design:**
- Art and politics are intertwined, especially in storytelling.
- The author mentions two aspects of the politics of storytelling: the politics of taste and the politics of artistic vs. commercial success.
- Americans, in particular, have a history of embracing change and transformation.
- There is a contrast between Hollywood's optimism and art films' pessimism.
- Writers often find their place within this triangle of storytelling styles.

**Points for Writers to Consider:**
- Writers must consider the audience's perspective and their expectations based on classical story design.
- Classical design aligns with human perception patterns and memory.
- The Archplot, a common story structure, is relatable to a broad audience.
- Most people cannot connect with inconsistent or passive storytelling styles.
- If a writer wants to create a film with mass appeal, it should lean toward the Archplot.

**Mastering Classical Form:**
- The history of art has seen cycles of avant-garde movements challenging established norms.
- Classical storytelling elements are deeply ingrained in human anticipation.
- Mastery of classical form involves shifting knowledge from intellectual awareness to living craft.
- It requires the writer to work at their skills until storytelling becomes instinctual.

**Believing in What You Write:**
- Writers must examine their motives and beliefs in their storytelling.
- Each story conveys a message about the writer's beliefs regarding life.
- Passionate conviction is crucial for making a story authentic.
- Avoiding commercialism for the sake of it can lead to inauthentic storytelling.
- Writers should write only what they genuinely believe in.

In summary, this passage explores the relationship between art and politics in storytelling, highlighting the need for writers to understand classical story forms, connect with their audience, and stay true to their beliefs when crafting narratives. It emphasizes that authenticity and passion in storytelling are key to engaging the audience.
## 3 STRUCTURE AND SETTING
**Structure and Setting:**

- **The War on Cliché:**
  - Being a writer in modern times is challenging because audiences have been exposed to countless hours of various forms of storytelling.
  - Clichés are a significant problem in storytelling and result from writers not fully understanding the world of their story.
  - Writers often choose settings without having a deep knowledge of them, leading to clichéd storytelling.

- **Setting:**
  - Setting in a story encompasses four dimensions: Period (time), Duration (length of time), Location (physical place), and Level of Conflict (human dimension).
  - Period refers to the time frame in which the story is set, such as contemporary, historical, or a hypothetical future.
  - Duration represents the story's length in time.
  - Location relates to the specific geographic setting of the story.
  - Level of Conflict pertains to the hierarchy of human struggles the story focuses on, whether internal conflicts, personal conflicts, societal conflicts, or environmental struggles.

- **The Relationship Between Structure and Setting:**
  - A story's setting defines its possibilities and limits.
  - Stories must adhere to their own internal laws of probability, dictated by the world the writer creates.
  - Each fictional world has its own unique rules for how and why events occur within it.
  - The audience expects consistency within the established world of the story.
  - The setting may seem restrictive to the imagination, but it is necessary for storytelling.

- **The Principle of Creative Limitation:**
  - Creating a small, knowable world is essential for storytelling.
  - A limited setting does not mean a trivial one; it means a setting that the writer knows deeply and comprehensively.
  - A writer must possess commanding knowledge of the setting, covering all relevant aspects.
  - Small, knowable worlds inspire creativity and originality, leading to unique and non-clichéd storytelling.

- **Research:**
  - Research is crucial in defeating clichés and ensuring a deep understanding of the story's world.
  - There are three methods of research: memory, imagination, and fact.
  - Memory involves drawing from personal experiences and turning them into working knowledge.
  - Imagination allows writers to immerse themselves in their characters' lives, filling in details that may or may not make it into the story.
  - Fact-based research is essential for ensuring accuracy and authenticity.
  - Research must not become a procrastination tactic and should be integrated with the creative process.

- **Creative Choices:**
  - Fine writing involves making creative choices of inclusion and exclusion.
  - Creativity means selecting the best ideas from multiple options.
  - Writers should seek inspiration from a deep source and aim for originality.
  - Sketching various scenes or ideas and then selecting the one that aligns best with the characters and the world is a creative process.
  - The pace of research should be ten to one or even twenty to one, with most ideas discarded in favor of excellence.
  - Genius in writing includes the ability to create expressive scenes and the judgment to eliminate banalities, conceits, and falsehoods.

In summary, this section emphasizes the importance of knowing the world of the story deeply, conducting thorough research, and making creative choices to avoid clichés and create original, engaging storytelling. It also underscores the value of limitation and the need for writers to have a profound understanding of their story's setting.
## 4 STRUCTURE AND GENRE
### THE FILM GENRES

1. **Historical Perspective on Storytelling**:
    - For millennia, narratives have been crafted and evolved through various mediums, culminating in a rich tapestry of diverse storytelling methods. From ancient oral traditions to modern film productions, the storytelling landscape has expanded immensely.

2. **Classification of Stories through Genres**:
    - To better understand and categorize the abundance of narratives, systems have been developed to classify stories based on similar characteristics, grouping them into genres.

3. **Disagreements in Classification**:
    - Despite these efforts, there has been no consensus on the criteria for classification, resulting in differing opinions on the number and types of genres present in storytelling.

4. **Aristotle's Contribution**:
    - Aristotle pioneered the concept of genres by categorizing dramas based on their outcomes and narrative designs, introducing four primary genres: Simple Tragic, Simple Fortunate, Complex Tragic, and Complex Fortunate.

5. **Audience Familiarity with Genres**:
    - Despite academic disputes over genre definitions and classifications, the audience is naturally adept at recognizing and understanding different genres.

6. **The Importance of Genre Knowledge**:
    - Creating a balanced narrative that captivates the audience requires a deep understanding of genres that surpasses the knowledge of the average viewer.

7. **Genre and Subgenre System for Screenwriters**:
   - Screenwriters employ a practical genre and subgenre system, shaped by experience rather than theory. It relies on differentiating factors such as theme, setting, role, event, and value orientations. Here is a breakdown:
     - **Love Story**: Focuses on romantic relationships, with a subgenre "Buddy Salvation" that highlights friendship instead of romance.
     - **Horror Film**: This genre can be subdivided into the Uncanny (rationally explainable horror sources), the Supernatural (irrational sources from the spirit realm), and the Super-Uncanny (keeps the audience guessing between the two).
     - **Modern Epic**: Emphasizes the conflict between individuals and the state.
     - **Western**: This genre has evolved significantly, as illustrated in Will Wright's analysis, "Six Guns and Society".
     - **War Genre**: Primarily centers on combat, with pro-war and anti-war as its main subgenres. Contemporary films often criticize war, unlike past films which subtly glorified it.
     - **Maturation Plot**: A coming-of-age story highlighting growth and development.
     - **Redemption Plot**: Focuses on the moral transformation of the protagonist from negative to positive.
     - **Punitive Plot**: Features a protagonist who turns evil and faces punishment.
     - **Testing Plot**: Explores themes of resilience against the temptation to give up.
     - **Education Plot**: Chronicles a profound transformation in the protagonist's perspective on life and self.

     - **Crime**: The subgenres in this category vary based on the viewpoint from which the crime is depicted.
     - **Social Drama**: Addresses societal issues and proposes solutions, with several focused subgenres.
     - **Action/Adventure**: Often integrates elements from other genres to fuel action-packed narratives, with subgenres depending on the source of antagonism and thematic depth.
   
8. **Supra-genres: A Wider Perspective**:
    - Supra-genres are broader categories that encapsulate multiple genres and are determined by factors such as settings, styles, or filming techniques. Examples include:
      - **Historical Drama**: Utilizes history as a rich source of narrative material, encouraging a contemporary interpretation of past events.
      - **Biography**: Focuses on the life of a particular person, with the need to craft a meaningful narrative rather than a mere factual account.
      - **Docu-Drama**: Revolves around recent events, offering a realistic portrayal.
      - **Mockumentary**: Pretends to be a factual account but is purely fictional, often critiquing various institutions through satire.
      - **Musical**: Involves narratives conveyed through songs and dances, which can adapt various genres into musical forms.
      - **Science Fiction**: Usually portrays futuristic dystopian worlds, blending with other genres to explore different narratives.
      - **Sports Genre**: Uses the backdrop of sports to explore various character development narratives.
      - **Fantasy**: Allows for a play with time, space, and reality, offering a platform for various genres to be explored in an alternate reality setting.
      - **Animation**: Provides limitless possibilities in narrative transformations, welcoming a range of genres and narratives.
      - **Art Film**: A genre that contradicts the notion of non-genre artistry, featuring subgenres of Minimalism and Antistructuralism with their own sets of conventions.

9. **Final Remarks**:
   - Although the list of genres and subgenres is extensive, it cannot fully encapsulate the fluidity and overlap between different genres. Writers are encouraged to identify and understand the nuances of their chosen genres, as this knowledge is inescapable and fundamental in crafting narratives. Ultimately, all writers are genre writers, contributing to the rich and diverse landscape of storytelling.

### THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND GENRE

- Every genre has particular rules and traits that dictate the story's format. These might include specific climactic events such as the tragic end in the *Disillusionment Plot*, characteristic settings as seen in *Westerns*, recurring events like romantic encounters in *Love Stories*, or defined character roles like the criminal in a *Crime Story*.
- The audience is well-acquainted with these rules and looks forward to seeing them manifested in the story.
- Selecting a particular genre not only guides but also restricts the narrative scope since the story needs to align with the audience's expectations and prior knowledge.
  
  > **^^Genre Conventions^^** are the distinct settings, roles, events, and values that characterize different genres and their respective subgenres.

- While each genre has its own set of rules, some genres are more flexible and straightforward compared to others that have strict and complex guidelines.
- The *Comedy* genre encompasses a vast range of subgenres, each with unique rules. However, a general rule that distinguishes it from drama is the assurance that characters do not experience real harm.
- In the realm of comedy, writers maintain a delicate balance, subjecting characters to extreme situations while guaranteeing the audience that no real harm will occur.
- Venturing beyond this creates a *Black Comedy*, where the audience might experience intense yet tolerable discomfort.
- *Art Films* adhere to a set of unconventional practices, including non-star casts, production outside the Hollywood nexus, and frequently non-English dialogues - traits that are leveraged in marketing the film as a non-mainstream contender.
- The primary hallmark of an *Art Film* is its minimalistic or anti-structural approach.
- Success within the *Art Film* category often brings swift, albeit sometimes fleeting, acclaim to the creator.
- Hitchcock asserted that artistic value is not mutually exclusive with mainstream success, and being an *Art Film* doesn't necessarily equate to higher artistic quality.

### ACHIEVING PROFICIENCY IN GENRE

- All of us are greatly indebted to the rich traditions of storytelling.
- It is essential to not just respect, but also thoroughly understand and excel in your chosen genre and its conventions.
- Nevertheless, the most profound insights are often derived from personal exploration; nothing sparks creativity more than discovering hidden gems on your own.
- A productive approach to genre study includes the following steps:
  - Initially, identify works that bear similarities to your own, considering both successful and unsuccessful examples (analyzing failures can be both enlightening and humbling).
  - Then, acquire the films and their scripts if possible.
  - Analyze the films meticulously, scrutinizing different aspects such as setting, role, event, and values.
  - Finally, compare these analyses to identify commonalities and discern:
    - The constants in stories of your genre.
    - The usual conventions concerning time, place, character, and action.
    - Understanding these elements is crucial, as without this knowledge, the audience will always be a step ahead.

  > To effectively foresee the audience's expectations, mastering your genre and its conventions is vital.

- A well-marketed film creates a sense of anticipation among the audience.
- The goal is to make the audience comfortable and engaged, eagerly awaiting the unfolding story.
- ^^Influencing the audience's perception^^ is not a new concept.
- Strategic marketing fosters expectations pertaining to the genre.
- Failing to adhere to or wrongly utilizing genre conventions can instantly disappoint the audience, leading to negative reviews and feedback for your work.

### Navigating Through Creative Constraints

- According to Robert Frost, writing without adhering to any rules or patterns (like free verse poetry) lacks a certain challenge that spurs creativity, akin to playing tennis without a net. 
- Employing a fixed rhyme scheme in poetry can lead to a richer and more intense output, as it pushes the poet to work within certain boundaries, thus triggering deeper creativity.
- The concept of ^^Creative Limitation^^ implies finding freedom and innovation within a set framework of constraints.
- It's vital initially to identify the genre or a mix of genres that will shape our work, as the genre conventions often nurture the most fruitful ideas, acting as the rhyme scheme in the narrative "poem".
- These conventions challenge writers to think creatively and develop narratives that not only meet but potentially surpass audience expectations, offering an enriched experience.
- Taking the *Action/Adventure* genre as an example, clichés are abundant, yet a fresh approach can significantly elevate the storytelling.

### Hybrid Genres 

- Genres can often be blended to create deeper narratives, enhance character development, and evoke varied moods and emotions.
- With over two dozen primary genres, the opportunities for innovative combinations are virtually limitless, enabling writers to craft unique and unprecedented film experiences.

### Transforming Genres 

- Being proficient in genre knowledge helps screenwriters stay relevant and modern.
- Genres serve as lenses through which writers can explore different facets of reality.
- Here, we delve into three examples illustrating the evolution of specific genres:
  - **The Western** 
    - Initially, Westerns served as allegorical tales portraying the battle between good and evil in a romanticized 'Old West'. 
    - In the 1980s, the genre evolved to address social issues, shedding light on themes such as racism and violence.
  - **The Psycho-Drama**
    - This genre's roots can be traced back to silent films like THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, focusing on clinical insanity.
    - As society grew more fearful of serial killers, the genre merged with detective narratives, forming the subgenre called *^^Psycho Thriller^^*.
    - In this subgenre, detectives often employed psychoanalysis to catch criminals, showcasing a deeper exploration of the human psyche and societal changes.
    - By the 1990s, these thrillers started reflecting communal paranoia, depicting trusted individuals in society as potential threats, resonating with broader societal fears.
  - **The Love Story**
    - Crafting a compelling *^^Love Story^^* revolves around creating significant obstacles for the romantic couple.
    - Despite a long history of consistent thematic elements, the twentieth century ushered in a wave of innovative challenges to love, mirroring changing societal attitudes towards romance.
    - Recent developments indicate a more cynical view of love, with films exploring the difficulties of sustaining romantic relationships.
    - Writers have begun transforming the traditional love story into narratives focusing on unfulfilled desires and yearnings, reflecting the changing societal attitudes towards love and relationships.
    - It's imperative for writers to stay attuned to these shifts in societal perceptions to create contemporary and resonant narratives.

### Sustaining Passion and Creativity

- Developing mastery in genre is also vital because screenwriting is a long-term endeavor, requiring a deep-seated commitment and passion.
- Screenwriting demands rigorous discipline, akin to undergoing rigorous training under a strict instructor.
- It's essential to find a central theme or idea that genuinely ignites your passion, providing a focal point for your creative journey.
- Picking a favorite genre and aligning it with your personal interests can foster a sustained commitment to the craft.
- Choosing a genre should be an honest decision, driven by genuine love for the kind of narratives it fosters, as it is this love that will fuel the long and often challenging journey of writing.

## 5 STRUCTURE AND CHARACTER

**Structure and Character:**

- The debate between plot and character as more important elements in storytelling is ongoing, but it is based on a false premise.
- The argument is flawed because structure and character are not separate entities; instead, they are interconnected.
- The confusion arises from a misunderstanding of the difference between "Character" and "Characterization."

**Character vs. Characterization:**

- "Characterization" encompasses all observable qualities of a person, including physical, psychological, and behavioral traits.
- It represents the sum of everything that can be known about an individual through careful scrutiny.
- However, "Character" is the true essence of a person, revealed through the choices they make under pressure.
- True character is unveiled when individuals are forced to make decisions in challenging situations, exposing their essential nature.
- Choices made under pressure are essential because they reveal the core values and traits of a character.

**Character Revelation:**

- The revelation of true character, in contrast to surface characterization, is fundamental to storytelling.
- True character is not always apparent from appearances or behavior but is exposed through choices under pressure.
- Shallow and one-dimensional characters are uninteresting, and deep characters must be written with hidden dimensions.
- Major characters, in particular, should have hidden depths, as they are central to the story.

**Character Arc:**

- The finest storytelling not only reveals true character but also depicts the inner transformation of characters, either for better or worse, throughout the narrative.
- The interplay between character and structure is a fundamental aspect of storytelling.
- The story initially presents the protagonist's characterization, followed by a deeper exploration of their character.
- This deep character often contrasts or contradicts their surface appearance.
- The story then subjects the character to increasing pressure, forcing them to make different choices.
- By the climax of the story, these choices have profoundly changed the character's humanity.

**Structure and Character Functions:**

- The function of structure is to create progressively increasing pressure that compels characters to make more challenging choices, gradually revealing their true natures.
- Characters must bring to the story the qualities of characterization necessary for their choices to be credible.
- Structure and character are intertwined; changing one will affect the other.
- All stories are character-driven because character and event structure are interconnected.
- The complexity of a character's depth should be adjusted according to the genre.

**Climax and Character:**

- Storytelling is a temporal art, and the climax of the story must be the most gratifying and meaningful moment.
- A significant portion of creative effort goes into designing the climax, making it the writer's ultimate task.
- A poorly executed climax can render all previous elements of the story meaningless.

## 6 STRUCTURE AND MEANING 

### ARTISTIC EMOTION

- Aristotle contemplated the differing reactions people have towards death in real life and as depicted in literature or theater.
- In human beings, cognitive processes and emotions usually function separately, often conflicting with each other.
- Our mental processes set the stage for emotional experiences, which then fuel new intellectual perspectives, constantly interacting and influencing one another alternately.
- Storytelling acts as a tool to craft moments of revelation, offering what is referred to as "artistic emotion."
- The fundamental drive behind all forms of art is the innate human desire to find harmony and beauty amidst chaos, and to revitalize a monotony-ridden life through creativity and a deep-seated, instinctual connection with truth.
- Storytelling fundamentally facilitates a simultaneous engagement of thought and emotion, creating a potent and memorable fusion of idea and emotional intensity.
- Unlike real life where experiences gain significance over time, in the realm of art, they are profound at the very moment they occur.
- Despite not being purely intellectual, storytelling is not against intellectualism; it incorporates intellectual insights to enhance taste and judgement, yet it transcends dry, logical arguments.
- Storytelling celebrates the union of rationality with the emotional realm, evoking a rich array of human faculties like empathy, foresight, and a natural affinity for truth.
  
### FOUNDATIONAL IDEA

- The creation of a story is enclosed within two vital concepts: the "Foundation Idea," which sparks the urge to weave a story, and the "Governing Idea," representing the final message conveyed through the climactic moments and artistic emotions of the narrative.
- Foundation Ideas are typically open-ended, igniting the spark of creativity through various catalysts, such as a fleeting thought or a simple observation.
- Writers should possess the courage to adopt a unique perspective and create striking and exhilarating insights.
- The initial idea that inspires a story doesn't necessarily have to be preserved throughout; it can be discarded if the narrative naturally shifts in a different direction, fostering continual inspiration and discovery.

### STRUCTURE AS PERSUASION

- It's critical to understand that while a story might originate from a dream and aims to evoke artistic emotion, the journey from an initial idea to a satisfying climax requires deep contemplation.
- An artist needs not only to convey ideas but also to substantiate them convincingly, crafting a narrative that portrays a believable metaphor for life.
- Storytelling essentially serves as a persuasive demonstration of an idea, where the events within the story not only express but validate the central concept without overt exposition.
- Accomplished storytellers rely on dramatization rather than explicit explanations, utilizing the dynamics of events to authenticate their perspectives.
- The effectiveness of artistic emotion can vary, aiming to evoke a range of emotions depending on the genre, but the universal principle remains: the emotional resonance and underlying message of the story must be articulated in an emotionally charged climax without relying on explicit dialogue.

### CONTROLLING IDEA

- **Controlling Idea**:
  - The term *Theme* has become vague for writers.
  - "Poverty," "war," and "love" are not themes but pertain to settings or genres.
  - A genuine theme is a sentence that captures the essence of a story's meaning.
  - "Controlling Idea" is a preferred term as it not only denotes the story's core idea but also indicates its role in guiding the narrative.
  - This idea acts as a creative discipline, helping writers determine what fits the narrative based on its relevancy to the Controlling Idea.
  - A finished story's Controlling Idea should be summarized in one sentence.
  - A story offers a comprehensive philosophy that audiences grasp intuitively, correlating with their life experiences.
  - The sharper the focus on a singular idea, the richer the interpretations audiences can derive. Too many ideas can lead to confusion.
  - A Controlling Idea is a sentence detailing how and why life changes from the story's start to its end. It consists of two elements: **Value** and **Cause**.
    - **Value**: The primary result (positive or negative) from the story's climax.
    - **Cause**: The primary reason for this result.
  - A story's substance explains the reasons for its ending. The Controlling Idea is the essence of the story's meaning.

- **Meaning and Creative Process**:
  - The Controlling Idea can emerge at any stage of the creative process.
  - The climax of the story is pivotal. It should be compelling and offer a sense of closure.
  - The Controlling Idea can be derived by assessing the value (positive or negative) added to the protagonist's world after the climax and identifying the chief cause for this value.
  - It's essential to let the story dictate its meaning. The final climax embeds the Controlling Idea, reflecting the writer's inner self.

- **Idea Versus Counter-Idea**:
  - Paddy Chayefsky would write his story's meaning and keep it in view while writing, ensuring all content aligned with the central theme.
  - A story evolves by dynamically juxtaposing its primary values: *Idea* and *Counter-Idea*.
  - Stories progress by alternating between positive and negative values. This rhythm culminates in a climax, determining the Controlling Idea. This tension and interplay are crucial to storytelling, and while basic, it can yield intricate narratives.

### Didactism

  - **Initial Premise**: Writers should avoid steering their narratives towards a preconceived idea or belief, as this can lead to a one-sided argument.
  - **Balanced Storytelling**:
    - Craft scenes and sequences with equal energy and truthfulness for both sides of an argument.
    - Amplify contrasting ideas depending on the ending to create a balanced narrative.
  - **Risks of Didacticism**:
    - Becoming an advocate for a single idea can lead to stifling opposing perspectives.
    - Using fiction as a tool to address societal issues can result in naïve didactism.
  - **Qualities of a Good Writer**:
    - Possesses a flexible, dialectical mind.
    - Engages with diverse viewpoints and explores all possibilities before establishing a firm belief.

- **Summary**
  - Didactism warns against narratives that overpoweringly advocate for a specific idea, urging for a balanced portrayal of perspectives.
  - Writers should cultivate a philosophy that considers diverse viewpoints, fostering a nuanced and honest exploration of themes.
  - Ultimately, an excellent narrative serves as a vivid metaphor of life, illustrating the multifaceted human experiences.

### Idealist, Pessimist, Ironist

This passage discusses the categorization of writers and their stories based on the emotional charge of their Controlling Ideas, which can be idealistic, pessimistic, or ironic.

**Idealist, Pessimist, Ironist:**
- Writers and their stories can be categorized into three main groups based on the emotional tone of their Controlling Idea.
- **Idealistic Controlling Ideas:** These stories express optimism, hopes, and positive visions of the human spirit. They depict life as people wish it to be.
- **Pessimistic Controlling Ideas:** These stories express cynicism, loss, and negativity, portraying civilization's decline and humanity's darker aspects. They depict life as it is often perceived.
- **Ironic Controlling Ideas:** These stories combine elements of both optimism and pessimism, presenting a complex and realistic view of life. They merge idealism and pessimism, resulting in an ironic Controlling Idea.

**Examples of Irony:**
- The passage provides two examples of Controlling Ideas with irony.
  - Positive Irony: The pursuit of contemporary values can lead to destruction, but redemption is possible if one recognizes the truth and abandons obsession.
  - Negative Irony: Clinging to obsession may lead to achieving desires but ultimately results in self-destruction.

**On Irony:**
- Irony evokes the audience's recognition that life contains elements of both idealism and pessimism.
- Reality is inherently ironic, making stories ending in irony resonate strongly with audiences.
- However, writing an ironic climax is challenging because it must convey both positive and negative messages clearly.
- It requires the deepest wisdom and the highest writing skill.
- Irony cannot be confused with ambiguity; it must be honestly motivated.
- Stories that end randomly or without clear motivation are not truly ironic.
- Balancing both charges (positive and negative) at the climax and expressing them in a way that doesn't cancel each other out is a complex task.

In summary, this passage highlights the three categories of Controlling Ideas in storytelling: idealistic, pessimistic, and ironic. It provides examples of ironic Controlling Ideas and emphasizes the challenges of writing an ironic climax that effectively conveys both positive and negative aspects of a story's message.

- **Summary**
  - This section highlights the significant role and responsibility of writers in society, emphasizing their power to depict truth and inspire change through their art.
  - Writers are considered as a potent force capable of challenging authority and fostering change, making their commitment to truth a vital act of social responsibility.
# PART 3 - THE PRINCIPLES OF  STORY DESIGN
  
## 7 THE SUBSTANCE OF STORY
This passage discusses the essence and role of the protagonist in a story, detailing various aspects that define and shape them. Here's a breakdown:

### Understanding the Substance of a Story
1. **Definition of Substance**
   - Core essence or energy in a story, which is not directly observable but can be felt.
   - Alive yet intangible, understood by viewing the story from the perspective of the character.

2. **Importance of Protagonist**
   - Central role embodying absolute character traits.
   - Can be a single entity or involve multiple entities (plural or multi-protagonist) that drive the plot.

### The Protagonist
3. **Roles and Varieties**
   - Single protagonist: traditional approach with one main character.
   - Plural-protagonist: a group sharing the same desire and facing mutual benefits and setbacks.
   - Multi-protagonist: characters pursue individual desires, leading to multiplot stories.
   - Can be non-human or change midway through the story.

4. **Essential Qualities**
   - **Willpower**: The ability to sustain desire through conflict and create irreversible change.
   - **Conscious Desire**: A clear, known objective or goal.
   - **Unconscious Desire**: An unnoticed, self-contradictory desire creating an inner conflict.
   - **Capacities**: Having realistic qualities and abilities to pursue their desires convincingly.
   - **Potential for Success**: Must have a credible chance to achieve their desires, fostering audience's hope and interest.
   - **Pursuit to the Limit**: The commitment to pursuing desires to the utmost extent defined by the story's setting and genre.
   - **Closure**: Ensuring the story reaches a conclusive end where all questions are answered and emotions are satisfied.
   - **Empathy**: Establishing a deep connection with the audience, fostering a recognition of shared humanity which may or may not include likability (sympathy).

### Summary

The excerpt explores the 'substance' of a story which represents the core essence that is felt but not directly perceived. It emphasizes the central role of a protagonist in embodying and conveying this substance through their journey and struggles in the story. The protagonist, who can exist in various forms, is characterized by a range of attributes including willpower, conscious and unconscious desires, realistic capacities, and the potential to attain their goals. The portrayal of the protagonist must also resonate with the audience, fostering empathy and connecting them to the character's desires and humanity. This ensures that the story achieves closure, satisfying the audience's emotional investment and expectations.

I have synthesized and clarified both parts of the text you provided into a summarized breakdown in bullet-point form:

### Understanding the Essence of Storytelling

- The substance of the story is likened to the energy in an atom; although unseen, it is felt and vital.
- This "substance" is an intangible force that drives the narrative and can be experienced more vividly when viewed through the lens of the character, especially the protagonist.
- Engaging with a story involves immersing oneself in the character's viewpoint and experiencing the events from that perspective.

#### The Protagonist
- Can be a single entity or can involve multiple central characters (plural-protagonist) sharing the same goal and facing shared consequences.
- There can also be multiplot stories with multiprotagonists pursuing individual goals.
- Protagonists are marked by their willpower and a conscious desire or goal, which may sometimes be accompanied by a contrasting unconscious desire.
- Protagonists must possess realistic capabilities to pursue their desires convincingly and have at least a fighting chance to attain their desires, embodying hope.
- The storyline should culminate in a final action, bringing the narrative to a fulfilling end.
- Protagonists need not be likable (sympathetic), but must evoke empathy, where the audience can see a reflection of their own humanity and consequently root for them.

### Audience Bond
- The bond with the audience is maintained through empathy, allowing them to live vicariously through various experiences depicted in the story.
- Creating an empathetic connection, even with unsympathetic characters, is crucial and a mark of great storytelling.
- Stories fail when they cannot forge this empathetic link with the audience, especially with characters perceived as hypocrites.

#### The First Step in Story Creation
- Story creation involves envisaging the character's actions based on their perspectives, often focusing on moments where expectations meet surprising responses or powerful antagonistic forces.
- The narrative concentrates on pivotal moments where the character's actions incite significant reactions, differing from real life where many actions yield expected outcomes.

#### The World of Character
- Story creation from the character's perspective involves immersing oneself into the deepest realms of the character's identity or ego.
- Imagining a character's world as concentric circles with an inner core representing the character's self, followed by circles representing various levels of conflict arising from personal nature, personal relationships, and external forces.
- Characters often find themselves in conflict with their own nature (mind, body, emotions), and personal relationships, besides facing external antagonisms.
![[Pasted image 20230910052207.png]]
#### Three Levels of Conflict
- Inner Circle: Conflict arising from elements of the character's own nature.
- Second Circle: Conflict encountered in personal relationships, going beyond conventional roles to encompass family, friends, and lovers.
- Third Circle: Extra-personal conflicts with social institutions and environments, including man-made and natural surroundings.

By delving into this breakdown, one can discern a guideline for crafting a powerful story with a well-rounded protagonist that can form a strong bond with the audience. It emphasizes the depth of character development, the importance of creating an empathetic connection with the audience, and the structured approach to building conflict within a narrative.

This passage explores the concept of "the gap" in storytelling and how it drives the progression of a character's actions and the development of a narrative:

**The Gap:**
- Storytelling is said to emerge at the intersection of subjective and objective realms.
- The protagonist in a story seeks something beyond their reach, and they take an action, believing it will lead to a positive outcome.
- However, when they take this action, the objective world reacts differently or more powerfully than expected, creating a gap between their expectation and reality.
- This gap represents the point where subjective anticipation collides with objective results.
- Characters make choices and take actions based on their beliefs about what will likely happen, but they only discover the truth (necessity) when they act.
- Necessity is what actually happens when they act, and it may contradict their sense of probability.
- The gap in reality forces the character to take a second action, often riskier and more challenging than the first.
- This process of taking actions and facing unexpected reactions continues, with each action opening new gaps in reality.
- This pattern repeats on various levels throughout the story until a final action is taken.
- These gaps in reality distinguish true action, which leads to significant change, from mere activity, where expected outcomes occur without significant change.
- The gap between expectation and result represents the point where the human spirit meets the world, shaping the essence of storytelling.
- Writers must work from the inside out to create these powerful narrative moments.
![[Pasted image 20230910052158.png]]
**The Gap in Progression:**
- The protagonist's actions repeatedly provoke antagonistic reactions, forcing them to adjust their expectations and take subsequent actions.
- The human mind adapts to these gaps, leading the character to take more challenging actions in line with their revised understanding of reality.
- This pattern of actions and reactions continues at various levels in the story until the final action, beyond which the audience cannot imagine another.
- The gaps in reality distinguish dramatic storytelling from mundane activity, marking moments of profound change.
- Writers find powerful storytelling opportunities in these moments, where the character's beliefs clash with the actual outcome.
![[Pasted image 20230910052149.png]]
In essence, the passage emphasizes the importance of the gap between expectation and reality in storytelling, driving character development and narrative progression. It highlights how characters evolve by taking actions and facing unexpected consequences, ultimately leading to a more engaging and dramatic narrative.

**Writing From the Inside Out:**

- Emotional truth is a crucial aspect of storytelling that cannot be created through observation alone.
- Emotional authenticity comes from within the writer.
- Staying outside your characters leads to writing emotional clichés.
- Scenes that are emotionally meaningful to the writer will likely resonate with the audience.
- Creating work that moves the writer has the potential to move the audience as well.

**Creating Within the Gap:**

- Writing "inner monologues" involves dissecting moments in a scene, exploring unspoken thoughts, sensations, and emotions.
- Writing from the inside out doesn't mean staying locked in a single character's point of view but involves shifting perspectives.
- Writers need to create reactions that deviate from what might be expected.
- By asking, "What is the opposite of that?" writers find hidden truths in the gaps.
- Writers are dialectical thinkers, often seeking contradictions and unexpected elements.
- The truth can be found in the gap between expectation and result.
- Writers have control over their characters and their universe, allowing them to explore various perspectives.
- Writers emphasize reactions, which add depth to the story.
- The most satisfying stories focus on the reactions characters have to events and the insights gained.
- Once a scene has been imagined and dissected, the writer commits it to paper, allowing readers to dive into the gaps and experience the story on an emotional level.

**The Substance and Energy of Story:**

- The substance of a story is not its words but the gap between what characters expect and what actually happens.
- This gap represents the breach in reality, the divergence from expectation to result.
- Building scenes involves breaking open these breaches in reality.
- The source of energy in a story is also the gap, which allows the audience to empathize with the characters.
- The gap is where the spark of life ignites, creating a connection between the audience and the story.
- This connection moves the audience emotionally and drives the power of the story.


## 8 THE INCITING INCIDENT 
### The World of the Story:

- Setting in a story includes aspects such as period, duration, location, and level of conflict.
- To tell an original and cliché-free story, you must fill this setting with depth and detail.
- Some general questions to ask about your story's world:
  - How do your characters make a living, and what is their work life like?
  - What are the politics of the world in your story, as power dynamics are inherent in all societies?
  - What rituals are important in your world, from public ceremonies to private rites?
  - What are the values that guide your characters' actions and decisions?
  - What genre or combination of genres does your story fall into, and how do you adhere to or creatively alter genre conventions?
  - What are the biographies of your characters, including their life experiences from birth to the start of the story?
  - What is the backstory of your characters, consisting of significant events from their past that influence the story's progression?
  - How have you designed your cast of characters, ensuring that each character serves a purpose and that there is polarization and contrast among them?
  - Are there distinct and diverse reactions from each character when something happens in the story, highlighting their individual viewpoints and attitudes?
  - If two characters have the same attitude and react similarly, consider consolidating or removing one to maximize opportunities for conflict and differentiation.

Understanding and exploring these aspects of your story's world can contribute to its richness and authenticity.

### Authorship, Authority, and Authenticity:

- When conducting thorough research on settings, a story gains a unique atmosphere and personality that sets it apart from others.
- Strive to be recognized and respected as an original author.
- Consider three key words: 'author,' 'authority,' and 'authenticity.'
- In the strict sense, a screenwriter is an author as they create settings, characters, and stories.
- A true author possesses godlike knowledge of their subject and writes with authority, drawing readers in because they sense the writer knows their subject intimately.
- Writing with authority leads to authenticity, which is essential for audience engagement.
- Authenticity means creating an internally consistent world, true to itself in scope, depth, and detail.
- Story arts do not distinguish between reality and various nonrealities like fantasy, dream, and ideality; they merge these into a convincing fictional reality.
- Authenticity depends on the "telling detail," where a few selected details engage the audience's imagination to complete a credible whole.
- Emotional authenticity is equally crucial, and authorial research should result in believable character behavior.
- Originality in storytelling comes from the struggle for authenticity, not eccentricity.
- Personal style arises when authorial knowledge meets your personality, resulting in unique choices and arrangements of material.
- Your work becomes an original reflection of who you are as a writer.

### The Inciting Incident

- The Inciting Incident is a dynamic and fully developed event that significantly disrupts the protagonist's life.
- It radically upsets the balance of forces in the protagonist's life, either in a negative or positive direction.
- It's typically a single event that happens directly to the protagonist or is caused by them.
- Occasionally, an Inciting Incident might involve two events: a setup and a payoff.
- The protagonist must react to the Inciting Incident, and their reaction can vary based on their character and the story's world.
- Even passive protagonists eventually seek to restore balance when their lives are disrupted.
- The Inciting Incident first throws the protagonist's life out of balance and then triggers the desire to restore that balance.
- This need leads to the conception of an Object of Desire, something they feel they lack or need to regain equilibrium.
- The Inciting Incident propels the protagonist into an active pursuit of this object or goal.
- Complex characters experience inner conflicts between conscious and unconscious desires, creating tension.
- The audience may sense or realize that the character unconsciously desires the opposite of their conscious desire.
![[Pasted image 20230910053703.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230910053715.png]]
### The Spine of the Story

- The Spine represents the deep desire and effort by the protagonist to restore the balance of life.
- It unifies all other story elements and holds the story together.
- Every scene, image, and word in the story relates, causally or thematically, to this core of desire and action.
- If there's no unconscious desire, the conscious objective becomes the Spine.
- If there's an unconscious desire, it becomes the Spine, allowing for a more complex character.
- An unconscious desire is typically more powerful and durable, rooted in the protagonist's innermost self.
- When an unconscious desire drives the story, it allows for a complex character who may repeatedly change their conscious desire.
![[Pasted image 20230910053728.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230910053737.png]]
### The Quest

- The Quest is a fundamental story structure where an event throws a character's life out of balance, leading to conscious and/or unconscious desires to restore balance.
- The character embarks on a Quest for their Object of Desire against various antagonistic forces, including inner, personal, and extra-personal.
- The character may or may not achieve their Object of Desire during the story.
- This Quest structure underlies all stories, regardless of genre or shape.
- Identifying the protagonist's Object of Desire helps understand the Quest form of the story and its narrative arc.

**Design of the Inciting Incident:**

- Inciting Incidents can occur either randomly (by coincidence) or causally (by decision).
- If by decision, the protagonist can make it happen, while if by coincidence, it may be tragic.
- The Central Plot's Inciting Incident must happen onscreen, not in the backstory.
- Each subplot has its own Inciting Incident, which may or may not be onscreen.
- The presence of the audience at the Central Plot's Inciting Incident is crucial for two reasons:
  - It provokes the Major Dramatic Question in the audience's mind, keeping them curious about the story's outcome.
  - It projects an image of the Obligatory Scene into the audience's imagination, an event they know they must see before the story ends.
- The Obligatory Scene represents a confrontation between the protagonist and powerful antagonistic forces, stirred to life by the Inciting Incident.
- Foreshadowing involves early events preparing for later ones, with the projection of the Obligatory Scene being a key component.
  
**Locating the Inciting Incident:**

- Typically, the first major event of the Central Plot occurs within the first 25 percent of the story.
- In a two-hour feature film, the Central Plot's Inciting Incident is often placed within the first half-hour to avoid boredom.
- The timing of the Inciting Incident should balance audience engagement with not arriving too soon or too late.
- The Inciting Incident should deeply engage the audience emotionally and rationally, making them ask the Major Dramatic Question and imagine the Obligatory Scene.
- The exact timing of the Inciting Incident depends on how much the audience needs to know about the protagonist and their world to have a full response.
- Some stories require no setup and demand an immediate Inciting Incident.
- The timing should be based on the audience's understanding, not overloading the opening with unnecessary exposition.
- Bergman's approach illustrates that the audience often grasps implications without the need for excessive detail.

**The Quality of the Inciting Incident:**

- The quality of the Inciting Incident, like any event, should be relevant to the story's world, characters, and genre.
- The writer must focus on its function, ensuring it:
  - Radically upsets the protagonist's life balance.
  - Arouses the desire to restore balance in the protagonist.
  - Inspires a conscious desire for an object or goal to restore balance.
  - In complex protagonists, it may also reveal an unconscious desire conflicting with the conscious need.
  - Launches the protagonist on a quest for their desire and raises the Major Dramatic Question for the audience.
  - Projects an image of the Obligatory Scene.

**Creating the Inciting Incident:**

- The Central Plot's Inciting Incident is one of the most challenging scenes to write, second only to the Climax.
- It often undergoes multiple revisions.
- Questions to help create it include:
  - What is the worst possible thing that could happen to the protagonist?
  - How could that turn out to be the best possible thing for them?
  - Conversely, what's the best possible thing for the protagonist, and how could it become the worst?
- Stories may cycle through these patterns multiple times.
- Stories aim for the extremes of human experience, not the middle ground.
- The Inciting Incident must disrupt the protagonist's status quo, introducing chaos into their universe.
- Ultimately, the story should find a resolution at the Climax that rearranges this universe into a new order, for better or worse.
## 9 ACT DESIGN
**Points of No Return:**

- Progressive Complications form a critical part of storytelling, extending from the Inciting Incident to the Crisis/Climax of the final act.
- To complicate means to make life challenging for characters, and to complicate progressively means to intensify conflicts as characters face increasingly potent forces of antagonism.
- This progression involves reaching "Points of No Return."

**Points of No Return:**

- The Inciting Incident sets the protagonist on a quest to obtain an Object of Desire, either consciously or unconsciously, to restore balance in their life.
- To start pursuing this desire, the protagonist takes a conservative action to elicit a positive response from their reality.
- However, these actions trigger antagonistic forces from various conflict levels, leading to a Gap between expectation and result.
- This Gap marks a Point of No Return, indicating that minimal efforts won't suffice, and actions of minor quality and magnitude should be eliminated.
- The protagonist then takes a more challenging second action, opening another Gap and signaling another Point of No Return.
- Moderate actions like the second one won't succeed, necessitating the elimination of actions of this magnitude and quality.
- The character must then adapt to changed circumstances and take an action requiring even more willpower and personal capacity.
- But once again, this action provokes stronger antagonistic forces, leading to another Point of No Return.
- The pattern continues, demanding greater capacities, willpower, and risk from the characters, and constantly passing Points of No Return in terms of action quality and magnitude.
- The story progresses forward, culminating in a final action that the audience cannot fathom surpassing.

**The Law of Conflict:**

- The protagonist enters a world governed by the Law of Conflict after the Inciting Incident, where nothing in a story progresses without conflict.
- Conflict is to storytelling what sound is to music, and it is vital for maintaining audience engagement throughout the narrative.
- Conflict is the essence of story and mirrors the conflicts we face in life.
- Life is characterized by scarcity, a perpetual conflict with lacking.
- Time is a fundamental category of existence, and we are constantly in conflict with time's limitations.
- Some writers fail by either overloading their stories with meaningless and excessively violent conflict or by lacking meaningful and honest conflict.
- Conflict changes in quality as it shifts from one level to another, but its quantity remains constant in life.
- Conflict is always present, and when it's removed from one level, it intensifies on another.
- Ultimately, life is about grappling with profound questions such as love, self-worth, inner chaos, social inequities, and the passage of time.
- The writer must decide how and where to orchestrate these struggles within the story.

**Complication Versus Complexity:**

- Complicating a story involves progressively building conflict until the story's conclusion.
- Conflict can arise from three levels of antagonism: inner, personal, and extra-personal.
- Simply complicating a story means placing all conflict on just one of these three levels, resulting in:

  - **INNER CONFLICT:** This level delves into the character's thoughts and emotions, often found in prose works of the "Stream of Consciousness" genre.
  - **PERSONAL CONFLICT:** These stories, often resembling soap operas, involve intricate relationships between characters, requiring a large cast and various settings.
  - **EXTRA-PERSONAL CONFLICT:** Typically found in action, adventure, or farcical genres, these stories involve physical conflicts and demand changing environments.

- Complicated films often share two characteristics:
  - A large cast, especially when focused on social conflict.
  - Multiple sets and locations, particularly when emphasizing physical conflict.

- Stories that complicate only on one level (inner, personal, or extra-personal) can be overly complicated and are often categorized as "Soap Opera" for personal conflict, "Stream of Consciousness" for inner conflict, or non-conventional prose works.

- Achieving complexity involves bringing characters into conflict on all three levels simultaneously.

- For most writers, it's advisable to design relatively simple yet complex stories that concentrate on creating richness and depth within constraints. This doesn't mean simplicity in storytelling; it means avoiding excessive character proliferation and location changes while focusing on developing complexity within the narrative.

**Act Design:**

- Stories are structured into movements known as **acts**, similar to how a symphony unfolds in multiple movements.
- Scenes are built from beats, which are changing patterns of human behavior.
- Ideally, each scene becomes a **Turning Point**, causing a significant but minor change in the characters' lives.
- Sequences, composed of multiple scenes, lead to a scene with a moderate impact.
- Acts are formed by sequences, with an act culminating in a scene that brings about a major reversal in the characters' lives.
- The number of major reversals in a story depends on its length; longer works require more major reversals.
- Aristotle suggests that longer stories need more major turning points to avoid boring the audience.
- A three-act structure is considered the minimum for a full-length narrative to have sufficient depth and complexity.
- A three-act structure consists of Act One, Act Two, and Act Three, each with its own unique characteristics and purposes.
- Act One typically takes up about 25% of the story and includes the Inciting Incident and Act One Climax.
- The last act is usually the shortest, with a swift rising action leading to the climax.
- Act Two is often the longest and can be challenging to maintain if it becomes overly extended.
- To address this issue, writers can add subplots or create more acts.
- Subplots have their act structures and can help deepen the overall narrative.
- Creating more acts, like five-act or seven-act structures, is possible but comes with potential downsides like inviting clichés and reducing the impact of climaxes.
- The balance between acts, subplots, and climaxes is essential to maintain a compelling rhythm in the story.
![[Pasted image 20230910054521.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230910054536.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230910054548.png]]
**Design Variations:**

- Stories can vary based on the number of major reversals and the placement of the Inciting Incident.
- The Inciting Incident can occur early or late in the story, depending on the audience's need to know the protagonist.
- Act structure can vary significantly based on choices made by the writer, including the number of major reversals and their placement.
- Different plot shapes and structures can be used creatively to suit the material, genre, and writer's style.
![[Pasted image 20230910054601.png]]
**False Ending:**

- In some cases, especially in action genres, a **False Ending** can be used, creating a scene that seems like the story's conclusion but leaves the audience wondering what will happen next.
- For most films, a False Ending is not suitable, and the Penultimate Act Climax should intensify the story's central question.

**Act Rhythm:**

- Maintaining a compelling rhythm in storytelling is essential to avoid repetitiveness.
- The dynamics of story depend on the alternation of value-charges, with climaxes providing positive and negative turns.
- Repetitiousness can diminish the impact of climaxes and harm the story's pacing.
- The placement of major reversals in each act helps create a unique rhythm for each story.

**Subplots and Multiple Plots:**

- Subplots can enhance a story by providing additional layers of conflict, thematic variation, or resonance with the Central Plot.
- Multiplot films weave together multiple plot lines, and the relationships between these plots can vary:
  - Subplots may contradict or resonate with the Central Plot's Controlling Idea, enriching the story with irony or variations on a theme.
  - Setup subplots can be used to introduce exposition indirectly.
  - Subplots can complicate the Central Plot, adding dimension and tension.
- Maintaining the right balance between the Central Plot and subplots is crucial to keep the story focused.
- Audience engagement relies on the story's ability to create a unified structure that holds all elements together.
- Adaptation from novels to screenwriting involves reinventing the interior life of characters and expressing inner conflict through visual elements.
- Sometimes, writers may need to break or bend conventions to prioritize what's most important in the story.

## 10 SCENE DESIGN
**Scene Design Components:**

This chapter discusses various components of scene design, including Turning Points, Setups/Payoffs, Emotional Dynamics, and Choice.

**Turning Points:**

- A scene is a condensed story within the larger narrative, characterized by actions, conflicts, and change.
- Scenes revolve around desire, action, conflict, and change.
- Characters in a scene pursue a Scene-Objective related to their Super-Objective, the overarching quest in the story.
- Characters act under pressure within scenes, and their actions lead to unexpected reactions, creating gaps between expectation and result.
- These gaps cause minor, moderate, or major changes in a character's life.
- A Sequence Climax is a scene with a moderate reversal, while an Act Climax has a major reversal.
- Ideally, every scene should serve as a Turning Point, offering surprises, increased curiosity, insight, and new directions to the audience.
- The effects of Turning Points are surprise, curiosity, insight, and a shift in the story's direction.
- Turning Points compel the audience to revisit the story to seek answers.

**The Question of Self-Expression:**

- Storytelling is a promise to the audience to provide surprises and insights into life.
- Writers must craft scenes that lead to curiosity and reward the audience's attention with insights.
- Good storytelling should make the audience feel like they are discovering these insights themselves.
- Language should serve as a tool for self-expression, delivering insights seamlessly and naturally.
- Insight is the audience's reward for paying attention, and a well-designed story offers this pleasure throughout the narrative.

**Setups/Payoffs:**

- Setups and Payoffs are essential tools for expressing the writer's vision.
- Setups involve planting knowledge within the story, while Payoffs deliver that knowledge to the audience.
- The gap between expectation and result drives the audience back into the story to find answers, which can only be found if the writer has prepared the insights through Setups.
- Setups must be handled carefully, with multiple layers of meaning, sometimes even on third or fourth levels.
- They should be planted firmly but not too subtly or too obviously.
- The strength of Setups should be adjusted based on the target audience's level of story literacy.
- Payoffs often become new Setups for future developments in the story.
- The creative process involves juggling Setups and Payoffs and requires imagination to generate unique ideas, even if they seem absurd at first.
- Logic is secondary to imagination, which is the primary driver of creativity in storytelling.


**Emotional Transitions:**

- Emotions in storytelling are evoked by taking the audience through experiences that lead to emotional reactions.
- Turning Points serve not only to provide insight but also to create emotional dynamics.
- There are fundamentally two emotions: pleasure and pain, with various nuances like joy, love, happiness, and their opposites.
- Emotions are experienced when the story guides the audience through transitions in values.
- To evoke emotions:
  - The audience must empathize with the character.
  - They should understand the character's desires.
  - The values at stake in the character's life must be clear.
- Changes in values lead to emotional shifts.
- Storytelling should create dynamic shifts between positive and negative emotions to avoid diminishing returns.
- The Law of Diminishing Returns states that repeating emotional experiences back-to-back reduces their impact.
- Comedy is an exception because laughter is not an emotion but a response to ridiculous or outrageous situations.
- Emotions should not be confused with feelings; emotions are short-term, while feelings are long-term and pervasive.
- Mood in storytelling creates specific emotional atmospheres and is shaped by various factors like lighting, tempo, style, and music.
- Mood complements emotions but doesn't replace them.

**The Nature of Choice:**
![[Pasted image 20230912041130.png]]

- Turning Points often revolve around choices made by characters under pressure.
- Human nature dictates that individuals will choose what they perceive as good or right.
- Choices between clear good versus evil or right versus wrong are predictable and uninteresting.
- True choice lies in dilemmas, which occur in two situations:
  - A choice between irreconcilable goods: The character wants two desirable things but can only choose one.
  - A choice between the lesser of two evils: The character faces two undesirable options but must choose one.
- True dilemmas reveal the character's humanity and the nature of their world.
- Three-sided situations are essential for meaningful decisions in storytelling.
- Triangular relationships between characters offer multiple possibilities and eliminate repetitiveness.
- Adding a third element creates closure and satisfaction in the story.
- Triangular design provides over twenty variations, offering ample material for storytelling without repetition.
- Choices in triangular relationships often involve sacrifices or irreversible changes, bringing the story to a close.
- Compelling dilemmas combine choices between irreconcilable desires and the lesser of two evils.
- Original stories can present dilemmas between various conflicting desires, and the key is to create choices between positive or negative desires of equal weight and value.

## 11 SCENE ANALYSIS

**Text and Subtext:**

- Scene analysis involves breaking down a scene into its text and subtext.
- **Text** refers to the sensory surface of the scene, including what is seen, heard, said, and done.
- **Subtext** refers to the hidden thoughts and feelings beneath the surface, both known and unknown, concealed by behavior.
- A good screenplay must incorporate a simultaneous duality:
  - Describing the sensory surface of life, such as visual and auditory elements and character actions and dialogue.
  - Creating the inner world of characters, including their conscious and unconscious desires, actions, reactions, impulses, and hidden thoughts and feelings.
- The principle of subtext recognizes that everything in life exists on multiple levels, and writers must convey this duality in their work.
- It's crucial not to write "on the nose," where characters express their deepest thoughts and feelings directly through dialogue and actions.
- Actors draw from the subtext to breathe life into their characters, going beyond what is explicitly written in the text.
- An actor's job is to convey the inner life of a character through unspoken and even unconscious thoughts and feelings, which then manifest as visible behavior.
- Scenes with no inner life or subtext are unactable because they lack depth and complexity.
- Subtext is a common phenomenon in storytelling, where audiences often feel they understand characters' hidden thoughts and emotions better than the characters themselves.
- The audience's ability to perceive subtext is what makes scenes come alive.
- It's not about insincerity but the understanding that people wear public masks and often cannot fully express their innermost thoughts and feelings.
- Even during passionate moments, there is always an unconscious dimension that remains hidden, necessitating the layering of subtext by the writer.
- Subtext is present in various storytelling formats, including novels, soliloquies, and voice-over narrations, as characters may not always know or be capable of telling the complete truth, even when they are alone.
- People wear masks to hide their true selves, even from themselves, and nothing is as it seems in life.
  
In summary, analyzing a scene involves separating its surface elements (text) from the hidden emotions, thoughts, and desires (subtext). Subtext is a crucial aspect of storytelling that adds depth and complexity to characters and their interactions, making scenes more engaging and relatable to the audience.

**The Technique of Scene Analysis:**

Analyzing a scene is a crucial step in understanding its core elements. Here's a five-step process to help uncover the scene's secrets:

1. **Define Conflict:**
   - Identify who or what drives the scene.
   - Determine their desires, expressed as infinitives (e.g., "to do this" or "to get that").
   - Recognize the antagonistic forces blocking these desires, also expressed as infinitives.
   - Ensure that desires and antagonistic forces are in direct conflict.

2. **Note Opening Value:**
   - Identify the value at stake in the scene at its beginning.
   - Describe whether this value is positive or negative (e.g., "Freedom, negative").

3. **Break the Scene into Beats:**
   - Define a beat as an exchange of action and reaction in character behavior.
   - Examine the scene's first action on two levels: what the character seems to be doing and what they are actually doing.
   - Name this subtextual action with an active gerund phrase (e.g., 'Begging').
   - Try to find phrases that touch the character's emotions, going beyond literal descriptions.
   - Describe the reaction to this action with an active gerund phrase (e.g., 'Ignoring the plea').
   - A new beat begins when behavior clearly changes.

4. **Note Closing Value and Compare with Opening Value:**
   - Evaluate the value-charged condition of the character's situation at the end of the scene.
   - Describe this condition in positive/negative terms.
   - Compare this closing value with the opening value noted in Step Two.
   - If they are the same, nothing significant has changed, and the scene is flat.
   - If the value has changed, it indicates a turning point in the scene.

5. **Survey Beats and Locate Turning Point:**
   - Review the gerund phrases describing character actions, starting from the opening beat and moving towards the end of the scene.
   - Look for a pattern or arc in action/reaction sequences.
   - Even seemingly random behaviors should have a purpose in a well-designed scene.
   - Locate the moment when a major gap opens between expectation and result, marking the turning point.

In summary, scene analysis involves understanding the conflict, dissecting the scene into beats, and identifying the turning point where a significant change occurs. Analyzing problematic scenes can lead to effective rewrites by aligning behavior with desires and making scenes more engaging.
## 12 COMPOSITION

**Composition in Storytelling:**

Composition in storytelling involves organizing and connecting scenes effectively. There are several canons of composition, including Unity and Variety, Pacing, Rhythm and Tempo, Social and Personal Progression, Symbolic and Ironic Ascension, and the Principle of Transition. Here's a closer look at some of these canons:

**1. Unity and Variety:**
   - A story, even when depicting chaos, must have a sense of unity.
   - The Inciting Incident should create a causal connection to the Story Climax.
   - Unity is essential, but variety should be introduced to keep the story engaging.
   - Authorial knowledge can add depth and variety to the narrative.

**2. Pacing:**
   - Pacing involves controlling the tempo of the story to maintain the audience's engagement.
   - Stories should have a rhythm that alternates between tension and relaxation.
   - Too much serenity can lead to boredom, while too much challenge can be overwhelming.
   - Well-structured stories use acts to modulate tension, allowing the audience to catch their breath and build energy for climactic moments.
   - Pacing should create cycles of tension and release, similar to the rhythm of life.

**3. Rhythm and Tempo:**
   - Rhythm is influenced by the length of scenes and how long the story remains in the same time and place.
   - Different scenes have different lengths, ranging from one-minute scenes to four-minute scenes.
   - Properly formatted screenplays use a page-to-minute ratio.
   - Scenes in a screenplay should vary in length to maintain a balanced pace.

   - Tempo is the level of activity within a scene, whether it's high or low.
   - The progression of scenes and sequences should accelerate the pace as the story heads toward climaxes.
   - Long, slow scenes can be effective, but they should be balanced with brisk, high-tempo scenes to maintain audience engagement.
   - Major climactic scenes should have controlled pacing to hold tension effectively.

In summary, storytelling composition involves maintaining a balance between unity and variety, controlling pacing to create a rhythm, and managing the tempo within scenes. These elements help maintain the audience's engagement throughout the narrative.

**Expressing Progression in Storytelling:**

Progression in storytelling involves the development of a narrative in a way that engages the audience by increasing the stakes and complexity. There are four primary techniques to express progression:

**1. Social Progression:**
   - Begin the story with an intimate focus on a few principal characters.
   - As the story unfolds, expand the impact of their actions into the wider society, gradually affecting more and more people.
   - This progression should happen gradually through the narrative.

**2. Personal Progression:**
   - If the story's setting or plot structure doesn't allow for broad social progression, focus on personal and inner conflict.
   - Start with a personal problem that seems solvable but requires balancing.
   - This conflict should deepen and evolve as the story progresses.

**3. Symbolic Ascension:**
   - Utilize symbolism to elevate the narrative's expressiveness.
   - Begin with symbols, actions, locations, or roles that represent themselves.
   - As the story advances, choose symbols that gather greater meaning, eventually representing universal ideas and themes.

**4. Ironic Ascension:**
   - Irony is a subtle but powerful storytelling tool that adds depth and engagement.
   - It plays with the discrepancy between appearance and reality, creating moments of revelation and truth.
   - There are six ironic story patterns, each involving unexpected twists that challenge characters' expectations and desires.

**Principle of Transition:**
   - To ensure a smooth progression in the story, transitions are essential between scenes.
   - Without transitions, a story may feel disjointed and lack continuity.
   - The third element, which connects two scenes, can be something in common or in opposition between the scenes.
   - Examples of third elements include characterization traits, actions, objects, words, qualities of light, sounds, or ideas.
   - Creative exploration can find unique and meaningful links between scenes, avoiding clichéd transitions.

In summary, expressing progression in storytelling involves various techniques, including social and personal progression, symbolic and ironic ascension, and the use of transitional elements to connect scenes. These techniques help create a dynamic and engaging narrative that evolves and deepens as the story unfolds.
## 13 CRISIS, CLIMAX, RESOLUTION
**Crisis in Storytelling:**

Crisis is a critical element in the structure of a story and represents a moment of decision for the characters. It is characterized by the protagonist making a crucial choice that will greatly impact the story's outcome. Key points about crisis include:

1. **Decision-Making:** Throughout the story, characters make decisions in each scene, but the Crisis is the ultimate decision where the protagonist faces a significant choice.

2. **Chinese Ideogram for Crisis:** The Chinese ideogram for crisis consists of two elements, danger and opportunity. The Crisis represents a moment of great danger and potential opportunity for the protagonist.

3. **Maximum Tension:** The Crisis is the point of greatest tension in the story, where both the protagonist and the audience are acutely aware that the next action will determine the outcome.

4. **Obligatory Scene:** The Crisis is often referred to as the story's Obligatory Scene, as it's a moment that the audience has been anticipating since the Inciting Incident.

5. **Dilemma:** The Crisis must present a true dilemma for the protagonist, forcing them to choose between irreconcilable goods, two evils, or a combination of both, placing maximum pressure on them.

6. **Revealing Values:** The protagonist's choice in the Crisis reveals the story's most important value, clarifying the central theme of the narrative.

7. **Testing Willpower:** Decision-making in the Crisis is more difficult than taking actions, and it tests the protagonist's willpower.

Crisis within the Climax:
- The action chosen by the protagonist in the Crisis becomes the central event of the Climax, leading to a positive, negative, or ironic Climax outcome.
- If the gap between expectation and result can be further widened during the Climax, it can lead to a more satisfying ending.

Placement of the Crisis:
- The placement of the Crisis is determined by the length of the climactic action, with both typically occurring in the final minutes of the story.
- However, in some cases, the Climax can extend over a longer period, with the Crisis Decision turning the Penultimate Act Climax or even the entire final act into a climactic action.

Design of the Crisis:
- The Crisis Decision is often deliberately static, taking place in one location, and is a crucial, emotionally charged moment.
- It should not be skipped or placed offscreen, as it's the Obligatory Scene that the audience eagerly anticipates.
- The energy built up until this point is dammed at the Crisis, only to explode into the Climax when the protagonist makes their decision.

In summary, the Crisis is a pivotal moment in a story where the protagonist faces a difficult decision that greatly influences the narrative's outcome. It's a moment of maximum tension and reveals the story's central values. Properly placing and designing the Crisis is crucial for effective storytelling.

**Climax and Resolution in Storytelling:**

**Climax:**

- Climax is the fourth part of the five-part story structure.
- It represents the most significant turning point in the story, characterized by a major reversal of values, either from positive to negative, negative to positive, or with irony.
- The action in the Climax must be clear and self-evident, requiring no explanation or dialogue to spell it out.
- This action can be catastrophic or seemingly trivial but must be appropriate for the story's needs.
- The Climax is the story's crowning moment, full of meaning, and must resonate deeply with the audience.
- It's essential for creating catharsis and emotional impact.
- Climactic subplots can be justified within the Climax of the Central Plot, or less important subplots can be climaxed earlier, building up to the Central Plot's Climax.
- A great film ending gives the audience what it wants but not in the way it expects, combining spectacle and truth.
- It should feel both inevitable, given the characters and world, and unexpected in the way it unfolds.
- The Key Image within the Climax encapsulates the film's meaning and resonates with the audience.

**Resolution:**

- Resolution is the fifth and final part of the five-part story structure, following the Climax.
- It serves three main purposes:
   1. To provide a resolution for subplots that couldn't be climaxed earlier or during the Central Plot's Climax.
   2. To show the spread of climactic effects, especially when the story widens into society, by bringing together the entire cast in a social event.
   3. As a courtesy to the audience, it offers a "slow curtain," a brief moment to allow the audience to gather their thoughts and leave the story with dignity.

In summary, Climax is the pivotal moment in the story, marked by a significant reversal of values and filled with meaning, while Resolution serves to tie up loose ends, show the wider impact of the Climax, and provide a gentle conclusion for the audience. Together, these elements create a satisfying and memorable narrative structure.
# PART 4 - THE WRITER AT WORK

## 14 THE PRINCIPLE OF ANTAGONISM
**The Principle of Antagonism in Story Design:**

- The Principle of Antagonism is a fundamental concept in story design, often overlooked but crucial for creating engaging narratives.
- Neglecting this principle is a primary reason for the failure of screenplays and films.
- The core idea is that a protagonist and their story can only be as intellectually fascinating and emotionally compelling as the forces of antagonism they face.
- Human nature tends to be conservative, avoiding unnecessary risks and changes.
- To make a protagonist a fully realized, multidimensional, and empathetic character, and to bring a screenplay to life, the negative aspects of the story are essential.
- The more powerful and complex the forces of antagonism that oppose the character, the more developed and compelling the character and story must become.
- "Forces of antagonism" refer to all the elements opposing the character's will and desire, not just specific antagonists or villains.
- A protagonist should be an underdog when comparing their willpower, capacities, and conflicts with the total forces of antagonism from within themselves, their personal conflicts, antagonistic institutions, and environment.
- While conflicts in various aspects of their life may seem solvable individually, the cumulative challenges should appear overwhelming as they embark on their quest.
- By investing energy into the negative side of the story, not only are characters fully realized, but the story itself reaches a brilliant and satisfying climax.

In summary, the Principle of Antagonism emphasizes the importance of well-developed antagonistic forces to create compelling characters and narratives, making the story more engaging and satisfying.


**1. Love:**
   - **Positive:** This represents healthy, reciprocal love in a relationship, where both parties care for each other.
   - **Contrary:** Unrequited love or a loveless relationship that lacks genuine emotions but still adheres to social norms.
   - **Contradictory:** Here, the opposite of love is hate or hostility, where characters actively dislike each other.
   - **Negation of the Negation:** This is the extreme end where characters loathe themselves or engage in self-destructive behavior, often leading to despair and self-hatred. It's a situation where love has turned into its polar opposite.

**5. Courage:**
   - **Positive:** Characters exhibit bravery in the face of danger or adversity.
   - **Contrary:** Occasional moments of fear or hesitation.
   - **Contradictory:** Characters consistently avoid challenges or act out of cowardice.
   - **Negation of the Negation:** The character acts in ways that are not only cowardly but also morally reprehensible, betraying others or themselves.

![[Pasted image 20230912044457.png]]


**6. Loyalty:**
   - **Positive:** Loyalty in a story usually starts with unwavering support and faithfulness to a person, cause, or group.
   - **Contrary:** A character may begin to doubt or question their loyalty but ultimately remains committed.
   - **Contradictory:** Characters may betray their loyalty or switch allegiances.
   - **Negation of the Negation:** At this extreme, characters not only betray their loyalty but actively work against those they were once loyal to. This could result in treachery or acts that lead to extreme harm or destruction.

![[Pasted image 20230912044503.png]]


**7. Maturity:**
   - **Positive:** Represented by personal growth, responsibility, and the ability to handle challenges with wisdom and grace.
   - **Contrary:** Moments of immaturity or instances where a character fails to handle a situation with the expected level of maturity.
   - **Contradictory:** A character consistently displays immature behavior, often avoiding responsibilities and acting impulsively.
   - **Negation of the Negation:** At this point, a character may not only act immature but also engage in self-destructive or socially harmful behaviors, leading to chaos or tragedy.

![[Pasted image 20230912044559.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230912044617.png]]



**8. Justice:**
   - **Positive:** Justice is served when fairness, equality, and the rule of law prevail, ensuring that individuals are treated fairly and their rights are protected.
   - **Contrary:** Minor injustices or instances where fairness is compromised but not to a significant degree.
   - **Contradictory:** Systemic injustice or the perversion of the legal system where individuals are consistently denied their rights.
   - **Negation of the Negation:** At this extreme, justice is completely absent, replaced by tyranny or a state where the powerful exploit and oppress the weak with impunity.

**9. Wealth:**
   - **Positive:** Represented by financial prosperity, where characters have the resources they need to live comfortably and achieve their goals.
   - **Contrary:** Characters may experience minor financial setbacks or moments of financial strain but can still meet their basic needs.
   - **Contradictory:** Consistent financial difficulties, where characters struggle to make ends meet and face significant economic challenges.
   - **Negation of the Negation:** At this extreme, characters experience extreme poverty, destitution, or complete financial ruin, often leading to desperation and despair.

![[Pasted image 20230912044426.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230912044432.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230912044438.png]]


These progressions can serve as a guide for writers to develop well-rounded characters and compelling storylines. By exploring these values and their extremes, writers can create complex character arcs and thought-provoking narratives that resonate with audiences.
## 15 EXPOSITION

In storytelling, the principle of "Show Don't Tell" is crucial, especially when it comes to handling exposition. Exposition refers to the essential information about the setting, characters, and their backgrounds that the audience needs to understand the story. Here are some key points about this principle:

1. **Invisible Exposition:** Skill in exposition means making it invisible. As the story unfolds, the audience should effortlessly absorb the necessary information without being aware of it.

2. **Dramatize Exposition:** Instead of forcing characters to explicitly explain facts to the audience, show these facts through natural and believable actions, dialogue, and events. Exposition should be dramatized, not delivered as dry information.

3. **Primary and Secondary Purposes:** Dramatized exposition serves two purposes. Its primary purpose is to advance the immediate conflict and story. Its secondary purpose is to convey essential information.

4. **Avoid Obvious Information:** Characters should not share information they both already know unless there is a compelling reason to do so. Only reveal information when it serves a dramatic purpose or creates a meaningful interaction.

5. **Pacing Exposition:** Exposition should be paced throughout the story. Less critical information can be introduced early, while more vital facts are revealed later, closer to the climax.

6. **Critical Exposition:** Critical exposition often involves secrets or painful truths that characters want to keep hidden. These revelations should be strategically placed to maximize their impact.

7. **California Scenes:** Avoid unrealistic scenes where characters, especially strangers, immediately engage in deep, personal conversations. Honest and powerful moments arise when characters are under pressure, such as at the story's climax.

8. **Save the Best for Last:** Exposition should be gradually revealed, with the most critical information saved for later in the story. Revealing too much too soon can make the story predictable.

9. **Creating Desire to Know:** If a piece of exposition must be revealed for the audience's comprehension, create curiosity and a hunger for that information. Arouse interest in the missing facts.

10. **Handling Biographical Exposition:** Instead of starting a character's story from childhood and progressing linearly, consider starting as close as possible to the climactic event of their life. This compresses the story's duration and increases the stakes.

11. **Conflict Generates Ammunition:** Characters with something valuable at risk, such as family, careers, or ideals, create conflict when their lives go out of balance. Conflict generates the need for ammunition, and characters use their knowledge and past experiences in their struggles.

12. **Controlled Disclosure:** As a writer, you should control the disclosure of exposition, revealing it only when necessary for the audience's understanding and engagement. Effective storytelling keeps the audience curious and invested in the unfolding narrative.

In summary, the key to handling exposition effectively is to make it invisible, dramatize it within the context of the story, and reveal information strategically to maintain audience interest and engagement.

This section discusses various techniques and pitfalls related to the use of backstory, flashbacks, dream sequences, montage, and voice-over narration in storytelling. Here are the key points:

**Backstory:**
- In storytelling, scenes can turn based on action or revelation, and powerful revelations often come from the backstory, the significant events in the characters' lives.
  
**Flashbacks:**
- Flashbacks are a form of exposition that can be done well or poorly.
- Well-executed flashbacks should be dramatized, creating mini-dramas within the story.
- Avoid introducing flashbacks until the audience has a need and desire to know the information.
- Unlike novels, screenplays cannot directly access characters' thoughts and feelings, so the use of flashbacks should not feel contrived.

**Dream Sequences:**
- Dream sequences are a way to convey exposition in a visually striking but often clichéd manner.
- They should follow the same principles as other forms of exposition, including dramatization and relevance to the story.

**Montage:**
- Montage sequences involve rapidly cut images to condense or expand time and convey information.
- While they can be visually engaging, they are sometimes used as a lazy substitute for true dramatization and should be used sparingly.

**Voice-Over Narration:**
- Voice-over narration is another way to deliver exposition.
- The test for its effectiveness is whether the story would still be well told without it.
- Less is more when it comes to narration, and it should be used sparingly, mainly for counterpoint or brief transitions.
- Overuse of narration can hinder storytelling and should be avoided.

The overall message emphasizes the importance of "Show, don't tell" as a call for artistic discipline and creativity. It encourages writers to respect the intelligence and sensitivity of the audience by dramatizing exposition and avoiding the temptation to rely on narration or other shortcuts that may diminish the storytelling experience.
## 16 PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

This chapter addresses eight key challenges in storytelling, providing craft-based solutions for each one. Here's a summary of the main points covered:

**The Problem of Interest:**
- A story must capture and maintain the audience's interest throughout, rewarding it at the climax.
- Curiosity and concern are essential elements of interest.
- Curiosity arises from unanswered questions and open patterns, while concern is driven by emotional needs for positive values.
- The audience seeks the "Center of Good" in the story, typically located in the protagonist.

**Mystery, Suspense, and Dramatic Irony:**
- These concepts are ways to connect the audience to the story, combining curiosity and concern.
- Mystery involves withholding certain expositional facts, creating curiosity about past events and secrets.
- Suspense combines curiosity about the outcome with shared knowledge between characters and the audience.
- Dramatic Irony involves the audience knowing more than the characters, creating tension through the characters' unawareness.
- The choice between these modes affects the audience's emotional engagement and empathy.

**Crafting Interest:**
- The craft of storytelling allows for the controlled release of information to keep the audience engaged.
- It's important not to abuse the power of mystery or withhold critical information artificially.
- False Mystery occurs when essential exposition is needlessly withheld, leading to frustration.
- Instead, storytelling should reward the audience's concentration with honest and insightful answers to their questions.

In essence, this chapter explores how to capture and maintain the audience's interest through a balance of curiosity, concern, and the controlled release of information, while avoiding artificial manipulations that can lead to a loss of engagement.

This chapter addresses several storytelling challenges and provides insights into how to tackle them:

**The Problem of Surprise:**
- Audiences desire surprise, the reversal of expectations.
- True surprise comes from revealing the gap between expectation and result, followed by a rush of insight.
- Cheap surprise relies on shocking tactics but lacks depth.
- While cheap surprise is suitable for certain genres, it can be a shoddy device outside those genres.

**The Problem of Coincidence:**
- Coincidence, though random and seemingly meaningless, is a part of life.
- Dramatizing coincidence by allowing it to gain meaning over time can make it meaningful in a story.
- Coincidence should be introduced early in a story to build meaning.
- Avoid using coincidence to resolve the story's ending, as it's unsatisfying and resembles a deus ex machina.

**The Problem of Comedy:**
- Comedy is a form of storytelling that critiques social institutions with humor.
- To create effective comedy, writers must identify what aspect of society angers them and target it.
- Comedy allows for scenes with no story purpose and tolerates more coincidence.
- Comedy relies on surprise and insight to create laughter.

**The Problem of Point of View:**
- Point of view in screenwriting can refer to both camera angles and the writer's perspective.
- POV within a scene involves choosing where to place the imaginary camera to view the action.
- POV within the story refers to the narrative perspective.
- Shaping a story exclusively from the protagonist's point of view is a creative discipline that can lead to a tighter and more engaging narrative.
- Spending more time with a character allows the audience to witness their choices, leading to greater empathy and emotional involvement.

In summary, this chapter delves into various challenges faced by storytellers and offers strategies to address them effectively. It emphasizes the importance of true surprise, meaningful coincidence, crafting effective comedy, and making deliberate choices about point of view to create engaging narratives.

This section discusses various challenges in storytelling, including adaptation, melodrama, and dealing with plot holes:

**The Problem with Adaptation:**
- Adapting a literary work to a screenplay is not a straightforward process and often involves complexities.
- Different storytelling media (prose, theater, screen) have unique strengths in portraying inner, personal, and extra-personal conflicts.
- Novels excel in depicting inner conflict, while theater excels in personal conflict, and film excels in extra-personal conflict.
- Adaptation can be challenging because each medium has its own inherent beauty and limitations.
- A general principle of adaptation is that the purer a novel or play is in its focus, the more challenging it is to adapt it into a film.

**The Problem of Melodrama:**
- Melodrama is often associated with overexpression and exaggerated emotions.
- However, melodrama is not necessarily the result of emotional intensity but rather the lack of sufficient motivation for characters' actions.
- The power of an event in storytelling should match the motivations driving the characters.
- Writers should not avoid writing powerful, passionate scenes; instead, they should ensure that the motivations behind these scenes are adequately developed.

**The Problem of Holes:**
- A "hole" in a story refers to a logical inconsistency or missing link in the chain of cause and effect.
- Like coincidence, holes can occur in real life situations.
- When handling a hole in a story, writers have several options.
- They can try to create a new scene to close the hole, which might feel awkward.
- Writers can also choose to leave the hole and hope the audience doesn't notice, although this approach is often seen as cowardly.
- Alternatively, some writers may expose the hole to the audience and deny that it is a hole, addressing it directly within the narrative.

In summary, this section highlights the challenges of adapting stories across different media, avoiding melodrama by ensuring character motivations align with their actions, and addressing plot holes in a way that maintains the story's credibility.
## 17 CHARACTER

This section delves into the concept of character development in storytelling:

**The Mind Worm Metaphor:**
- The idea of the Mind Worm serves as a metaphor for the writer's role in creating characters and stories.
- It imagines a creature that burrows into an individual's brain, understands them completely, and triggers events in their life, leading to a unique adventure.
- Writers are akin to Mind Worms as they delve into characters, discover their aspects and potential, and create events tailored to their unique natures, such as the Inciting Incident.

**Characters Are Not Human Beings:**
- Characters in storytelling are not real human beings but works of art.
- They are metaphors for human nature, designed to be clear and knowable.
- Characters are superior to real people in the sense that their aspects are designed for clarity, while real individuals can be enigmatic.
- Character design involves both characterization (observable qualities) and true character (the person's core nature).
- True character is revealed through choices made in dilemmas, especially under pressure.

**Desire and Motivation:**
- True character is closely tied to desire, and understanding what a character wants is crucial.
- A character comes to life when their desires, including unconscious ones, are clear.
- Motivation explores why a character wants what they want, but this can be subject to interpretation.
- The writer should not overly reduce motivation to specific causes but leave some mystery around it for the audience to interpret.
- The audience understands characters through various cues, including physical appearance, setting, what other characters say about them, and what they say about themselves.

**Character Dimension:**
- Character dimension is a concept often misunderstood.
- It refers to creating depth and complexity in characters.
- Adding quirks or eccentricities may not necessarily make a character more dimensional.
- Contradiction is a key element of character dimension, either within a character's deep nature or between their characterization and true character.
- A character's contradictions should be consistent.
- The protagonist should be the most dimensional character in the story to focus the audience's empathy on them.

In summary, this section emphasizes the importance of creating well-defined characters with clear desires, motivations, and dimensions, using contradiction and consistency to make them captivating and relatable to the audience.

This section explores character design and development in storytelling:

**Cast Design:**
- The protagonist plays a central role in creating the rest of the cast.
- Supporting characters are primarily defined by their relationships with the protagonist and how they help reveal the protagonist's complex nature.
- The example protagonist given is multifaceted, exhibiting traits like amusement, optimism, moroseness, cynicism, compassion, cruelty, fearlessness, and fearfulness.
- Supporting characters, such as A, B, C, and D, are designed to bring out different aspects of the protagonist's personality through their interactions.
- These supporting roles are crucial to making the central character's complexity consistent and credible.
- Supporting characters can also possess complexity, even if to a lesser degree, to add depth to the story.

**Character Dimension:**
- Character dimension refers to creating depth and complexity in characters.
- Contradictions within a character's nature or between their characterization and true character are essential for dimension.
- The physical and social environment in which a character exists is an aspect of characterization.
- Dimension can be created by juxtaposing conventional personalities against exotic backgrounds or vice versa.
- While big parts should have freshly observed traits, bit parts should not be made more interesting than necessary.

**The Comic Character:**
- Comic characters are marked by a blind obsession and relentless pursuit of their desires.
- They don't step back from risks as dramatic characters might.
- To make a character funny, identify their mania or obsession.

**Three Tips on Writing Characters for the Screen:**
1. Leave room for the actor: Allow actors to bring their creativity and interpretation to the characters.
2. Fall in love with all your characters: Embrace and understand all characters, even the antagonists and "bad" ones.
3. Character is self-knowledge: Understand your own humanity to better understand and create deep, relatable characters.

In summary, this section highlights the importance of crafting supporting characters that complement the protagonist and contribute to their complexity. It also emphasizes the need for contradictions and consistency in character design and offers tips for creating memorable characters in screenwriting.
## 18 THE TEXT

This section delves into the aspects of dialogue and description in screenwriting:

**Dialogue:**
- Dialogue in screenwriting is not the same as real conversation; it must be more engaging and purposeful.
- Screen dialogue should be concise, economical, and have a clear direction.
- Each line of dialogue should serve a purpose in advancing the story or character development.
- Screen dialogue should sound natural and informal, reflecting how people speak in everyday life.
- Screenwriters must consider that film is primarily visual, so dialogue should complement the visual elements.
- It's important to avoid lengthy speeches and focus on action/reaction patterns to keep the audience engaged.
- The periodic sentence, where meaning is revealed at the end of a line, adds suspense to dialogue.
- Silence and visual elements are often more powerful than dialogue in filmmaking.

**Description:**
- Screenwriters cannot use literary devices like metaphor and simile, as screenplays are meant to be realized on the screen.
- The goal of screenwriting is to describe scenes in a way that allows readers to visualize the film as they read.
- Descriptions should focus on what is photographic and avoid abstract or non-visual elements.
- Screenplays are written in the present tense, and vividness is achieved by naming objects and actions directly.
- Avoid generic nouns and verbs with adjectives or adverbs; use specific nouns and vibrant verbs instead.
- Eliminate the use of "is" and "are" as screenplays capture constant change and action.
- Metaphors, similes, and phrases like "as if" should be eliminated unless they can be visualized on screen.
- Avoid camera and editing notations, and focus on the essential angles necessary for storytelling.

In summary, this section emphasizes the importance of crafting purposeful and economical dialogue while also providing vivid and visual descriptions in screenwriting. It highlights the difference between literary writing and writing for the screen, focusing on the visual and immediate aspects of film storytelling.
## 19 A WRITER'S METHOD

This section discusses two different approaches to writing screenplays: writing from the outside in and writing from the inside out.

**Writing from the Outside In (Struggling Writer's Approach):**
- The struggling writer typically starts with an idea, goes straight to the keyboard, and begins writing, focusing heavily on description.
- This approach often leads to mediocre results, frustration, and the writer blaming external factors like Hollywood's preferences for their lack of success.

**Writing from the Inside Out (Successful Writer's Approach):**
- Successful writers use a reverse process that involves meticulous planning and preparation.
- They spend the first four months of a six-month screenwriting timeline working on stacks of three-by-five cards, creating a step-outline for the story.
- A **step-outline** is a concise description of each scene in the screenplay using one or two sentences, outlining what happens, how it builds, and turns.
- Each card in the step-outline also indicates which step in the story's design the scene fulfills.
- This process allows writers to create more material than they can use, helping them search for quality by discarding the mediocre.
- Writers research and imagine extensively during this stage but keep the story disciplined to the step-outline.
- Once the writer discovers the story climax, they move on to the treatment stage.
- The step-outline is not typically shown to others as it's a tool for the writer's use.
- The **treatment** expands each scene from the step-outline into a paragraph or more of description, detailing all actions and providing a full subtext of characters' thoughts and feelings without writing dialogue.
- A proper treatment can be 60-90 pages of double-spaced text.
- Changes may occur during the treatment stage as the writer refines the story.
- Only after completing the treatment does the writer move on to writing the screenplay itself.

In summary, successful screenwriters tend to follow an inside-out approach, starting with meticulous planning, creating a step-outline and treatment before finally writing the screenplay. This method allows them to discard mediocre material and focus on delivering a high-quality story.

This section discusses the process of writing a screenplay and emphasizes the benefits of following an inside-out approach:

- Writing a screenplay from a thorough treatment is an enjoyable process that can progress at a rate of five to ten pages per day.

- Converting the treatment's descriptions into screen descriptions and adding dialogue is a crucial step in the screenplay writing process.

- Even in the first draft stage, changes and revisions will likely be necessary.

- Developing judgment and taste, along with the ability to identify and correct weaknesses, is vital for a writer.

- Rushing straight from a treatment to a screenplay can result in a "surrogate treatment," lacking depth and exploration.

- It's advisable to delay writing dialogue for as long as possible because prematurely writing dialogue can stifle creativity.

- Writing from the outside in, where dialogue is prioritized before scenes or story, is considered the least creative method.

- Screenwriters often overvalue dialogue because it's the only part of their writing that directly reaches the audience.

- Prematurely focusing on dialogue can lead to a slower and less effective writing process.

- While the inside-out method is recommended, it's acknowledged that every writer may develop their unique approach, and some may produce quality screenplays using other methods.

- The inside-out approach combines discipline and freedom, encouraging writers to produce their best work.
