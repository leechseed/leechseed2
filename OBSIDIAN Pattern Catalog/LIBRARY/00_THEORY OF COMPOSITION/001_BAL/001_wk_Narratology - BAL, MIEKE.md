## 2: The Narrator

## Worksheet: Crafting a Compelling Story through Narration and Focalization

---

### Step 1: Establishing the Narrator's Identity & Role

1. **Who is your narrator?** Jot down basic details:
   - Name (if applicable):
   - Background:
   - Personality Traits:
   
2. **Focalization**:
   - Whose perspective is central to your story? Why?
   - How does this focal point color the narrative?

3. **Perception**:
   - How does your narrator perceive events and characters?
   - What biases or preconceived notions might they have?

---

### Step 2: Choosing the Narration Form

1. **Narrator's Voice**:
   - Choose the primary voice for your story:
     - [ ] First-person 
     - [ ] Third-person
     - [ ] Second-person (experimental)

2. **External vs. Character-Bound Narrator**:
   - Will your narrator be:
     - [ ] External (Describing others)?
     - [ ] Character-Bound (Describing self)?

3. **Truth in Narration**:
   - How will your narrative convey truth or reality? 
   - Will there be any intentional distortions or unreliable elements?

---

### Step 3: Diving Deeper into Narrative Techniques

1. **Character-Bound Narrative**:
   - If your narrator is character-bound, how will they recount their experiences? 
   - Will their narrative lean towards autobiography, or will there be elements of surrealism or magic realism?

2. **External Narrative**:
   - If you chose an external narrator, how will they present their accounts of other characters?
   - Will there be any speculative elements or a need for the narrator to assume or guess?

---

### Step 4: Exploring Narrative Rhetoric & Truth

1. **Narrative Claims**:
   - How will your story present "truths"? 
   - Will it lean towards realism, or will there be clear markers of fiction?

2. **Narrative Signals**:
   - List any phrases or cues you'd like to use to signal fictionality (e.g., "Once upon a time..."):

3. **Child Narrators** (If applicable):
   - If choosing a child as a narrator, what unique perspectives will they bring?
   - How will their language use or worldview differ from an adult's?

---

### Step 5: Analyzing Narrative Identity & Context

1. **Narrative Agents**:
   - Identify any additional agents or entities that influence the narrative.
   - How do these agents interact or contrast with the main narrator?

2. **Witnesses**:
   - Will there be any "witnesses" in your story? If so, how do they influence the narrative?
   - Describe their role and how they might sway the reader's emotions or perceptions.

3. **Narrative Situations**:
   - Detail any shifts or changes in the narrative stance throughout your story.

---

### Step 6: Tackling Second-Person Narration (For Experimental Narratives)

1. **Narrative Voice**:
   - If opting for a second-person narration, identify your goals. What do you hope to achieve with this voice?

2. **Engaging the Reader**:
   - How will you ensure the reader identifies with the "you" in the narrative?

3. **Deixis**:
   - How will you handle contextual words like “I,” “you,” “here”? 
   - Will there be an interchangeability of the first and second person?

---

### Final Thoughts:
Reflect on the narrative decisions made in the steps above. How will they drive the overall story arc, character development, and thematic elements?

*Remember:* A story's narrative voice and focalization play crucial roles in engaging readers and conveying the desired emotional and thematic impact. As you craft your story, remain attentive to these elements, ensuring they align with your broader narrative goals.
