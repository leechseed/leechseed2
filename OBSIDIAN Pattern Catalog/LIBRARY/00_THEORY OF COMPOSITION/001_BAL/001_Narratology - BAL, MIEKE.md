# Introduction 

**Narratology: Defining and Understanding Narratives**

- **Working Definitions**:
  - Purpose: To empower narrative students with foundational understandings to test against their studies.
  - Core: Definitions do not hold absolute truths but act as tools for discussion and understanding.

- **Narratology**:
  - Definition: The ensemble of theories about narratives encompassing various cultural artefacts that tell a story.
  - Role: Helps in understanding, analyzing, and evaluating narratives.

- **Theory**: 
  - Definition: A systematic set of statements about a segment of reality.
  - Application: For narratology, the segment is narrative texts from varied backgrounds with multiple functions.

- **Characteristics of Narrative Texts**:
  - Purpose: Understanding these characteristics assists in understanding the construction of each narrative.
  - Result: Allows for a description of a narrative system, and the variations possible within that system.

- **Narrative System**:
  - Definition: The description and understanding of how narratives are constructed.
  - Role: Using finite concepts from the system, an infinite number of narrative texts can be described.

- **Use of Theory**:
  - Not a Machine: Theory isn't a straightforward input-output mechanism; interpretation remains essential.
  - Tool for Interpretation: Concepts presented are intellectual tools that help articulate understanding and facilitate discussions.

- **Textual Descriptions**:
  - Subjectivity: Reading is inherently subjective, leading to varied descriptions even when using the same theoretical tools.
  - Democratic Theory Use: Systematic theories enable a "democratic" sharing and discussion of interpretations, promoting intersubjectivity.

- **Corpus of Narrative Texts**:
  - Initial Thought: Novels, novellas, short stories, fairy tales, newspaper articles, etc.
  - Boundaries: Debate exists on what should be included, like comic strips.
  - Importance of Definitions: Agreeing on definitions, like what constitutes a "text," can resolve disagreements.

- **Challenges of Definitions**:
  - Variability: Common terms like literature, narrative, and text can have varied meanings to different people.
  - Provisional Nature: Definitions proposed are temporary and serve primarily to ensure clarity in discussions.

**Key Idea**: Narratology provides a structured approach to understanding narratives, relying on systematic theories and definitions to interpret and discuss a diverse range of narrative texts.

**Narratology: Understanding Texts, Stories, and Fabulas**

- **Text Definition**:
  - Core Idea: A finite, structured ensemble of signs.
  - Variety: Signs can range from linguistic units (words, sentences) to other mediums like cinematic sequences, painted elements, etc.
  - Boundaries: Although a text has definitive starting and ending signs, its meanings and interpretations can be infinite.

- **Narrative Text**:
  - Definition: A medium (language, imagery, sound, etc.) where a story is conveyed by an agent to an addressee.
  - Distinction: Not synonymous with the story it portrays.

- **Story vs. Fabula**:
  - **Story**:
    - Definition: The content of a narrative text giving a unique manifestation to a fabula.
  - **Fabula**:
    - Definition: A sequence of logically and chronologically connected events involving actors.
    - Elements: Incorporates "events" (transitions from one state to another) and "actors" (agents performing actions).

- **Theory in Practice - "Tom Thumb" Example**:
  - Different Texts, Same Story: The fairy tale can be narrated in multiple versions, each being a unique text but presenting a similar story.
  - Text Diversity: Some versions might be literary, others suitable for children, or some might be too frightening.
  - **Story vs. Fabula Distinction**:
    - Perspective: Readers may perceive events differently based on their presentation in the story compared to the events' sequence in the fabula's world.
    - Emotion Elicitation: Despite the cruel nature of the fabula, the story presentation makes readers sympathize with certain characters over others.
  - Transcending Mediums: The story's impact isn't solely language-based; reactions can be consistent across different mediums, like cartoons.

- **Three-layer Analysis**:
  - Layers: Text, Story, and Fabula.
  - Analytical Approach: These layers can be analyzed separately, though they are interconnected.
  - Material Existence: Only the text, manifested in specific sign systems, is materially accessible.
  - Basis: This three-layered distinction is theoretical, rooted in reasoned suppositions.

**Key Idea**: Narratology offers a three-layered perspective - text, story, and fabula - where each layer brings unique depth to the understanding and interpretation of narratives.

**Narratology: Layers, Fabula Elements, and Narration**

- **Significance of Layers**:
  - Core Idea: Layers are provisional tools crucial for a detailed text analysis.
  - Reading vs. Analyzing: While interconnected, they are distinct activities; reading encompasses interpretative moments that later influence analysis.
  
- **Understanding the Fabula**:
  - Definition: Material or content shaped into a story; a series of events with inherent logic.
  - Key Elements of a Fabula:
    - **Events**: Sequential actions that adhere to the logic of events.
    - **Actors**: Agents of action with specific functions and relations to events.
    - **Time**: All events consume time, crucial for continuity and outcomes in a fabula.
    - **Location**: Every event happens somewhere, whether real (e.g., Amsterdam) or imaginary (e.g., Narnia).
    
- **Processes Involved in Structuring a Story**:
  - **Sequence Arrangement**: Events might differ from their chronological order.
  - **Time Allotment**: The story designates time to fabula elements based on their significance.
  - **Character Formation**: Actors gain distinct traits, individualizing them.
  - **Location Specificity**: Places where events occur are defined uniquely.
  - **Inter-element Relationships**: Symbolic, allusive, and traditional relationships among elements.
  - **Point of View Selection**: Determines the focalization, lending subjectivity to the story.
  
- **From Fabula to Narrative Text**:
  - **Story Distinction**: Each story, though sourced from a fabula, has unique traits or aspects.
  - **Narrative Text Definition**: A conveyed story requiring a medium and conversion into signs.
  - **Narration**:
    - **Agent**: Not to be confused with the actual author; often a fictitious narrator.
    - **Narration Dynamics**: The narrator can intermittently relinquish the narration to actors, especially during direct speech.

**Key Idea**: In narratology, layers serve as tools for textual analysis, the fabula encompasses key foundational elements, and narrative texts evolve from stories through specific narrational techniques and mediums.
# 1 Text: Signs



## 1: Preliminary Remarks 

**Narrative Agents and the Dichotomy of Authorship**

- **Definition of a Narrative Text**:
  - Core Idea: A medium wherein a narrative agent communicates a story.
  - **Narrative Agent Distinction**: 
    - Defined as a subject (either linguistic, visual, or cinematic) that expresses through the medium, but not to be confused with the real-life author.
    - Example: The narrator of "Emma" is distinct from Jane Austen, the author.

- **Narrative Agent vs. Biographical Author**:
  - **Separation Principle**: The real-life circumstances of the author are not relevant to narratology, the study of narratives.
    - E.g., Jane Austen's personal history is not of consequence in the analysis of her narrative style in "Emma".
  - **Terminology Clarification**: The narrative agent will occasionally be referred to as "it" to avoid confusion with the real-life author.

- **Interpretation Power Struggle**:
  - **Author's Authority**: Relying on the author to validate interpretations can be a misstep, as it ties the idea of "author" with "authority."
  - **Reader's Role**:
    - Undoubtedly vital in an interactive understanding of a narrative.
    - But their interpretation power is not absolute; influenced by cultural and social norms.
    - The perspective that every reader uniquely interprets a narrative is not fully accurate.

**Key Idea**: In narratology, it's crucial to distinguish between the narrative agent and the real-life author. While both have roles in the interpretation of a narrative, neither holds an absolute power over its understanding.

## 2: The Narrator

**Understanding Narration and Its Complex Layers**

- **Narrator’s Identity & Role**:
  - **Narration's Character**: The identity of the narrator and how it's presented in a text gives the story its unique character.
  - **Focalization**: 
    - Definition: Represented coloring of the story by a perceiving agent, establishing the viewpoint.
    - Connection: Narrator and focalization together define the narrative situation.
  - **Perception's Role**: Perception, both in seeing and interpreting, is the essence of narration.

- **Distinction in Narration Forms**:
  - **Narrator's "Voice"**:
    - Traditionally categorized as “first-person” or “third-person,” with occasional "second-person" experiments.
    - Note: "Third-person narrator" is misleading; a narrator is not a "he" or "she."
  - **Examples**:
    - First-person: "(I say:) I will be twenty-one tomorrow."
    - Third-person: "(I say:) Elizabeth will be twenty-one tomorrow."
  - **External vs. Character-Bound Narrator**:
    - **External Narrator**: Does not reference itself as a character.
      - Focuses on other characters or events.
    - **Character-Bound Narrator**: Identified with a character within the story.
      - Often implies a recounting of true events about themselves, even if implausible.

- **Narrative Rhetoric of Truth**:
  - **Character-Bound Narrative**:
    - Often suggests an autobiographical tone.
    - Example: Cortázar’s “Axolotl” – a first-person narrative of transformation into a lizard, exploring human identity.
  - **External Narrative**: 
    - Presents stories about others as factual.
    - Example: "(I narrate: (I testify:)) Elizabeth felt a great anxiety that day."

**Key Idea**: Narration intricately layers the identities of narrators, their voice, and the focalization of the story, emphasizing the importance of perception and the rhetoric of truth in storytelling.

**Summary: The Narrator and Forms of Narration**

- **Narrator's Identity & Character**:
  - The identity of the narrator significantly impacts the character of the text.
  - This identity is often tied to the concept of focalization, which together determines the narrative situation.
  - Focalization is the perceived coloring of a story by an agent of perception or point of view holder.
  
- **Narration and Focalization**:
  - Narration inherently implies focalization.
  - There's a need to differentiate between textual agents (like linguistic or visual) and the object of their activity, which may be produced by a different agent.
  - Language is believed to shape vision and worldview.
  - Perception and interpretation are central to narration.
  
- **Forms of Narration**:
  - Traditionally narratives have been categorized based on the "voice" of the narrator as "first-person" or "third-person", with few exceptions in "second-person".
  - However, regardless of the grammatical point of view, a narrator is always the "first person". 
  - The distinction between "first-person" and "third-person" narratives lies in who the narrative is about - self or someone else.
  - Narrators can be external (telling about others) or character-bound (telling about themselves). The latter often claims to be recounting true facts.
  
- **Narrative Rhetoric & Truth**:
  - Narrators, especially character-bound ones, often imply the truthfulness of their account.
  - Indications such as "Once upon a time..." suggest fictionality.
  - External narrators can also present stories about others as true, though the distinction between factual and fictional is crucial.
  
- **Child Narrators and Authenticity**:
  - A child narrator can bring an authentic and raw perspective to a story.
  - The same story can vary in perception and presentation depending on the age and knowledge of the narrator, as showcased in the given examples.
  - Language and the relationship with it can be a central theme, especially when there's a shift from native to foreign understanding, leading to a split in the subject's identity.

**Key Idea**: The identity and perspective of the narrator, combined with the forms of narration, play a pivotal role in shaping the character and authenticity of a narrative, influencing how stories are perceived and interpreted.

**Narrative Techniques and the Construction of Identity in Literature**

- **Toni Morrison's Fragmentation:**
  - Description: Morrison's "Beloved" presents a narration highlighting fusion with the mother and self-fragmentation.
  - Context: Symbolizes the early infant's unformed ego, linking to the tragic history of slavery.
  - Symbolism: The struggle to remember trauma is represented metaphorically by the challenge of "re-membering" one's face or body.
  
- **Louis Couperus's Characterization and Themes:**
  - Author Background: Couperus, a Dutch author, grew up in a colonial administrators' family, witnessed severe parental expectations, and lived in the Indies.
  - Primary Themes: The inevitability of fate in human life, depicted as a force filled with guilt. His works often contrast the north (cold, somber, male) with the south (sensual, female).
  - Example Novel: "Of Old People" - A Dutch variant of Naturalism highlighting hereditary flaws across generations and the looming reveal of a past crime.

- **Diverse Narrative “I” Constructs:**
  - *Steyn's Voice Passages*:
    - Passage d: An external narrator describes a scene where Steyn's voice irritates his wife, Ottilie.
    - Passage e: A character-narrator, presumably Ottilie, recounts her own experience hearing Steyn's voice.
    - Passage f: A detached narrator gives insight into the relationship dynamics between Steyn and Ottilie.
    - Passage g: The narrative suggests Steyn's suspected infidelity and Ottilie's irritation every time he goes out.
  - Analysis: Each passage offers varied relationships between the narrative "I" and the story's content. They exemplify different blends of narrators, focalizers, and actors.

**Key Idea:** Narration techniques, whether through fragmented experiences or character-focused storytelling, profoundly shape the reader's perception and understanding of identity and events in literature.

**Understanding Narration and Focalization in Literature**

- **Double Focalization**
  - The text introduces the concept of double focalization which involves two perspectives: an external one (possibly from the narrative agent) and a character's perspective. This dual perspective is symbolized as EF [CF (Ott.)]-Steyn.
  - An example given demonstrates that while Steyn's voice is heard, the reaction (startling) is observed from Ottilie's perspective, suggesting both focalizations at play.

- **Narrative Identity & Historical Context**
  - Narration in literature involves different agents with distinct identities. The text references older literature, such as works by Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Balzac, Dickens, and Cervantes's Don Quixote, as examples where such narrative techniques are prominent.
  - These authors often utilize narrative claims of truth as a fictionality device, evident in direct claims of truth or contradiction of the same.

- **Role of the Narrator as a Witness**
  - A witness in narrative serves multiple roles, from conveying emotions like compassion or irony to influencing the story's veracity. The presence of a witness in a story might not always be overt, but their influence is crucial.
  - The narrator, when acting as a witness, might remain invisible yet plays a vital role in the narrative, influencing the reader's emotional connection and ethical considerations.

- **Variability of Focalization**
  - Focalization can shift between characters and agents. For instance, in Alain Robbe-Grillet’s La jalousie, despite a consistent narration technique, many critics view the narrator as a specific character due to the influence of the title.
  - In another example, the narrative voice, Steyn's voice in this case, suggests that the narrator acts as a witness to the events described, raising questions about the source of the information.

- **Different Narrative Situations**
  - The text provides several examples, showcasing distinct narrative situations, highlighting the versatility of narration in literature.
  - Whether the narrator stands inside or outside the story, whether the focalization is embedded, and whether the narrative "I" speaks about itself or others, all contribute to the narrative's depth and complexity.

- **Traditional Narration Distinctions**
  - The distinction between "I"-narratives and "he"-narratives is deemed inadequate. Factors such as the narrator's involvement in the story and its relationship to the object of narration need consideration.
  - Narration can remain constant or evolve throughout a text. A once imperceptible narrator might later reference itself, subtly shifting the narrative experience and introducing the presence of a witness.

**Key Idea:** 
Narration and focalization in literature are intricate tools that authors employ to convey depth, perspective, and emotion, with varied narrative identities and roles influencing the reader's experience and connection to the story.

**Analysis of Second-Person Narration**

- **The Illusion of "Second Person" in "La modification"**
  - Michel Butor's novel uses the second person consistently, which initially interrupts the traditional narrative flow.
  - Eventually, the narrative prevails, with readers reverting to first-person interpretation, making the protagonist's journey more relatable.
  - The “you” used in the novel cannot align with the reader or be perceived as an addressee in lyrical poetry; it's an “I” in disguise. It gives an impression of an interior monologue.
  
- **Essence of Language and Deixis**
  - Butor failed to embrace the essence of the second person, which lies in the core of communication.
  - Linguist Émile Benveniste emphasizes the significance of deixis (contextual words like “I,” “you,” “here”).
    - Language's essence isn't just about the world but about the formation of subjectivity essential for communication.
    - Pronouns like “I” and “you” are contextually empty and don't reference outside the situation they're used in. 
    - The second person (you) validates the “I” as a speaker, while also having the potential to become an “I” in a different perspective.
  
- **Flaw in "La modification"**
  - The novel lacks the feature of deixis: the interchangeability of the first and second person.
  - Characters other than “you” are always referred to in the third person, creating a separation rather than mutual subjectivity confirmation.
  - This leads to the pronoun “you” symbolizing alienation instead of subjectivity fulfilment. The reader never identifies with the “you” or becomes its counterpart, the “I.”

- **Inherent Challenge of Second-Person Narrators**
  - Based on Butor’s use, second-person narrators seem not only logically problematic but also unmanageable for readers.
  - The actual “second person” in narrative storytelling is the reader themselves.

**Key Idea**: The intricacies of second-person narration, as explored through Butor's "La modification," reveal the challenges in accurately capturing the essence of deixis, emphasizing the importance of mutual subjectivity in communication.
## 3: Non-Narrative Comments

**Analysis of Non-Narrative Comments in Texts**

- **Definition and Importance**
  - Non-narrative comments are segments within a narrative text that don't necessarily drive the narrative forward.
  - These comments can be critical as they often contain ideological statements.
  - Analyzing these segments helps to understand a text's overt and more subtle ideologies.
  
- **Example: "Danny Goes Shopping" by L. Roggeveen**
  - Main Story: Danny observes the arrival of a bridal pair.
  - Non-narrative Sections:
    - Lines 9-15 convey the love between Mr. Alexander and Miss Ann without presenting new events.
    - Lines 13-15 offer opinions on societal norms regarding love and marriage, suggesting it's universal and expected behavior.
    - The mock dialogue form, exclamation marks, and terms like "of course" aim to present the opinion as self-evident and universally accepted.
  
- **Characteristics of Non-Narrative Comments**
  - They can be descriptive, mentioning elements from the fabula, or argumentative, discussing general knowledge outside of the fabula.
  - The form of representation, like the catechistic style in the example, carries its ideological implications.
  - It's important to note that both narrative and non-narrative sections can convey ideology, but in different ways.
  
- **Interplay of Different Textual Forms**
  - While non-narrative sections can explicitly present an ideology, other parts of the text might contradict or treat them ironically.
  - To fully grasp a text's ideological stance, one should analyze the relationship between its narrative and non-narrative elements.
  
- **Ubiquity of Non-Narrative Comments**
  - They appear throughout narratives, providing depth, context, or color to the main story.
  - Non-narrative texts, like scientific writings, can also contain narrative elements.

**Key Idea:** Non-narrative comments, though not central to the main plot, play a vital role in shaping the ideological undertones and context of a narrative, bridging the gap between straightforward storytelling and broader societal or cultural insights.

## 4: Description

**Description in Narrative Texts**

- **Role and Impact of Description**
  - Description acts as a pivotal focalization point, influencing a text's ideological and aesthetic resonance.
  - Essential for narrative as it makes the fabula's world vivid, facilitating shared imagination.
  - Logically necessary to contextualize fabula elements, so their roles are coherent.
  
- **Defining Description**
  - The essence lies in the attribution of features to objects.
  - For instance, an excerpt from "The Golden Bowl" by Henry James predominantly describes Bob Assingham's physical traits.
  - Description can sometimes blend with narration, like in "Dombey and Son" by Charles Dickens, where the environment is depicted alongside a progression of time and events.
  
- **Historical Treatment of Description**
  - Within the realistic tradition, descriptions have been contentious.
    - Plato, in the "Republic," sought to make Homer's text purely narrative, eliminating descriptions.
    - Homer tried to incorporate description within a narrative frame, such as describing Achilles's shield as it was being crafted.
  - The 19th-century realistic novel often justified descriptions with narrative motivation.
  - The "nouveau roman" genre, despite its avoidance of representation, still integrates description in its tradition.

**Key Idea:** Description, while sometimes seen as secondary to narrative, is both practically and logically vital, acting as a medium to vividly convey the imagined world and context of the fabula, and has been treated with varying degrees of integration across literary traditions.

**Motivation in Descriptive Narratives**

- **Rhetorical Strategy and Realism**
  - Descriptions, traditionally seen as interrupting the fabula, define a narrator's rhetorical strategy.
  - In realistic narratives, descriptions demand motivation.
    - Zola's perspective of objectivity in novels means making descriptions appear natural and self-evident.
    - Such "objectivity" often veils subjectivity, especially when narratives hinge on reader-character psychological identification.
  
- **Aspects and Types of Motivation**
  - Realist narrative emphasizes motivation to ensure content is plausible.
  - Three distinct motivations:
    - **Speaking:** Narration requiring a listener who lacks knowledge.
    - **Looking:** Dominant form where description reproduces a character's vision. For example, the passage from Jean Rhys's "Outside the Machine" justifies the act of looking based on the characters' setting and situation.
    - **Acting:** Direct interaction with an object, turning description narrative-like, as seen in Zola’s "La bête humaine" or Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude."
  
- **Challenges and Limitations of Motivation**
  - Fiction's inherent arbitrariness means an endless need for motivation.
  - Authors like Sarraute and Robbe-Grillet from the French nouveau roman criticize realistic fiction's endless quest for motivation.
  - The fundamental arbitrariness of fictional content makes total motivation elusive and, to an extent, arbitrary itself.

**Key Idea:** In realistic narratives, motivation – whether through speaking, looking, or acting – is essential to make descriptions plausible and integrate them seamlessly into the story, although achieving total motivation remains a challenge due to fiction's inherent arbitrariness.

**Rhetorical Structures in Descriptions**

- **Fundamental Mechanics of Description**
  - Descriptions use rhetoric to present arbitrary elements as natural or inevitable.
  - Components of a description:
    - **Theme:** The main object being described.
    - **Sub-themes:** Components or elements of the main object.
    - **Predicates:** Qualities or characteristics of the theme or sub-themes, which can be qualifying or functional.
    - Relations between theme and sub-theme are often synecdochic or metonymical, while relations between a theme or sub-theme and predicates can be metaphorical.

- **Six Types of Descriptive Structures**
  - **1. Referential, Encyclopaedic Description**
    - No figurative language; offers pure knowledge.
    - Components are selected based on their contiguity.
    - Encyclopaedia is the model for this type.
  
  - **2. Referential-Rhetorical Description**
    - Combines knowledge conveyance with persuasion.
    - Uses wording and content choices for persuasion.
    - Modelled on tourist guidebooks.

  - **3. Metaphoric Metonymy**
    - Constructs using contiguity but individual components are metaphorical.
    - Implicit components lead readers to fill in the gaps.

  - **4. Systematized Metaphor**
    - The entire description acts as a comprehensive metaphor.
    - Elements are systematically related, built upon contiguity.
    - Context defines the dominating series in the metaphor.

  - **5. Metonymic Metaphor**
    - One extensive metaphor with elements in a contiguous relationship.
    - When taken out of context, it resembles other types.
    - Explicit comparisons can lead to Homeric comparisons.

  - **6. Series of Metaphors**
    - A succession of adjusted metaphors without constant reference to the compared element.
    - Creates an impression of an elusive, indescribable compared element.

- **Implications and Applications**
  - These rhetorical categories help to differentiate and analyze narratives across various historical periods or styles.

**Key Idea:** Descriptions use varied rhetorical structures to convey information, with six main types identified based on the relationships and tropes within them, providing tools for narrative analysis across historical and stylistic contexts.

**Analysis of “Descriptology” in Djuna Barnes’s Nightwood**

- **General Overview**:
  - The excerpt discusses the art of description as illustrated by a fragment from Djuna Barnes's modernist novel, Nightwood (1937).
  - The description being analyzed portrays a scene where Felix Volkbein observes Robin Vote, setting the stage for the narrative of Nightwood.

- **Narrative Techniques**:
  - **Introductory Frame**: 
    - The narrative commences with setting the scene, placing readers in a hotel setting.
    - Provides an external viewpoint of Robin Vote, focusing on her surroundings and appearance.
  - **Use of Metaphors & References**: 
    - Barnes incorporates various metaphors and allusions, painting Robin as an enigmatic, multi-faceted entity – referencing the sea, forest, mushrooms, and more.
    - The depiction of Robin as a "born somnambule" hints at her elusive nature, inaccessible to any observer or suitor.
  - **Decentring Techniques**: 
    - The narrative meanders, venturing into descriptions that serve to distract from the central scene. This, in turn, adds depth and complexity.
    - Barnes uses the ekphrasis technique, describing a non-existent painting, thereby expanding the imagery.

- **Focalization**:
  - **Perception Link**:
    - The story adopts Felix Volkbein's perspective, underlining the subjective nature of the description. His ascent contrasts with his downward gaze upon Robin.
  - **Descriptive Elements**: 
    - Barnes presents Robin as a spectacle, emphasizing her allure through vivid details, from her posture on the bed to her attire.
    - The environment around Robin, such as the exotic plants and faint birdsong, further romanticizes the setting.

- **Symbolism and Motifs**:
  - **Nineteenth-Century Artist's Studio Setting**: 
    - The described ambiance, including potted plants and cut flowers, alludes to a late 19th-century artist's workshop setting, enhancing the scene's aesthetic.
  - **Sensory Descriptions**: 
    - Barnes involves multiple senses, from the visual representation of Robin and her surroundings to auditory elements like the birds' song and olfactory cues describing Robin's unique scent.

- **Anticipation and Suspense**:
  - The elaborate details preceding Robin's description heighten suspense and accentuate her eventual portrayal.
  - The scene foreshadows an impending relationship between Felix and Robin, hinting at its doomed nature.

**Key Idea**: 
The analysis underscores the intricacies of narrative description, demonstrating how Djuna Barnes masterfully employs focalization, metaphor, and other literary techniques to craft an evocative, layered portrayal of a scene in "Nightwood".
## 5: Levels of Narration 
**Levels of Narration in Couperus's "Of Old People"**

- **Emotive Language Use**
  - The phrase “Oh, that voice of Steyn’s!” remains unchanged in fragments d to g, displaying emotive language.
  - The use of the word “Oh” and the exclamation mark indicate strong emotion.
  - The lack of a verb in the sentence enhances its emotional effect.
  
- **Narrative Structure**
  - Declarative verbs signal a change in narrative level.
  - When the external narrator "yields the floor," it is often to a character like Ottilie.
  - This is termed a "second-level character-bound narrator" (CN2), where a character is quoted by the first-level narrator.
  
- **Embedded Sentences**
  - Embedded sentences, like "Oh, that voice of Steyn’s, I hissed between my teeth," indicate shifts between narrative levels.
  - These shifts help distinguish between events that happened "then" versus the narrative "now."
  - Direct discourse represents a linguistic event, while the conveyed emotion, in principle, is the event itself.
  
- **Perceptible External Narrator**
  - The external narrator becomes more evident when they show emotion or reactions, suggesting their presence in the narrative.
  - This leads to the possibility of the narrator transitioning to an actor within the narrative.
  
- **Thoughts vs. Spoken Words**
  - Not all "quoted" words are spoken; some might just be thoughts.
  - This distinction is crucial as it can imply fictionality, and dictate the balance of power between characters.
  - If a character's internal thoughts, especially judgments about others, are revealed without being spoken to the character in question, it establishes an inequality in narrative power dynamics.
  
- **Example from "The Cat" by Colette**
  - The man's thoughts about his wife are regularly presented to the reader without the wife's knowledge.
  - This creates a power imbalance as she remains oblivious to his feelings.

**Key Idea:** The narrative structure and levels of narration play a pivotal role in shaping the reader's understanding and perception of characters, relationships, and events, leading to varied interpretations and emotional engagements with the story.

**Levels of Narration in Literary History**

- **Historical Characterization of Narratives:**
  - Levels of narration can characterize narratives historically in terms of literary currents.
  - Avoiding facile categorizations is vital; the structure can provide nuances to these characterizations.
  
- **Examples from French Literature:**
  - *Flaubert’s Madame Bovary*: Begins with an internal narrator. Quoted speeches are second-level narrations.
    - The first-person narrator disappears quickly, seeming to shift to an external narrator.
    - The initial "we" (nous) suggests that the narrator was present, acting as a witness.
    - The narrative pulls the first person from the past into the present, emphasizing Flaubert's realism.
    - It suggests the novel's events are a "real-life" account of life in the countryside.
  - *Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu*: The first sentence introduces a repeated action.
    - It sets a tone for a deep reflection on sleep, bridging conscious and unconscious existence.
    - This positions the narrator as deeply subjective, emphasizing Proust's modernist poetics.
    
- **Realism vs. Modernism:**
  - Flaubert's realism is about the "here-and-now". The objective nature of realistic fiction is not guaranteed.
  - Proust's modernist approach emphasizes the subjectivity, representing a different era of poetics.
  
- **Inflection and Nuance in Established Literary Movements:**
  - Neither Flaubert nor Proust strictly fit their respective literary periods.
    - Flaubert refines realism by implicating the reader and setting a contemporary provincial backdrop.
    - Proust explores subjectivity and the challenges it presents to narration.
  - Both authors utilize embedded speeches to explore the boundaries of their contemporary poetics.

**Key Idea:** Levels of narration can be instrumental in understanding and characterizing literary works in light of their historical contexts, with Flaubert and Proust showcasing how these narrative structures can inflect and nuance established literary movements.

**Postmodern Narration in J.M. Coetzee’s "Foe"**

- **Coetzee's Reworking of Defoe's Classic**:
  - J.M. Coetzee's "Foe" critically revisits Daniel Defoe’s "Robinson Crusoe."
  - Contrary to Defoe's original, Coetzee's Cruso does not document his journey. Instead, the account is given by a woman, Susan Barton.
  - Friday, initially introduced as a mere footprint in Defoe’s work, is introduced right at the beginning in Coetzee's version.
  - This twist challenges the traditional form of narration by an internal narrator.

- **Narrative Uncertainties**:
  - The target audience of Susan's narration remains ambiguous.
  - Flaubert's and Proust's narratives have clear subjects, whereas Coetzee flaunts the subject ambiguity.
  - Susan is the evident narrator from the start, yet there are hints suggesting another layer of narration above her.
  
- **Quotation Marks and Levels of Narration**:
  - Every paragraph starts with quotation marks until part III, but they don't always close.
  - Quotation marks hint at an embedding of Susan's narration within a broader story.
  - An address to a "you" suggests a potential higher-level narrator, later revealed to be Foe.

- **Susan's Self-Perception**:
  - Susan provides a descriptive view of herself that seems impossible for an internal narrator to convey.
  - She struggles with the differentiation between her lived experiences and the narration thereof.
  - Susan eventually views herself as merely a witness, lacking substance or the "truth" in her story.

- **Conversations with Foe**:
  - Susan engages in passionate discussions about storytelling with Foe.
  - There's a blurred distinction between who truly holds the narrative authority.
  - The lines between character and narrator blur further when Susan questions her own existence and reality.

- **Postmodernism's Narrative Complexity**:
  - Coetzee's novel embodies postmodernism by challenging conventional notions of narration.
  - The continuous uncertainty regarding "Who is speaking?" exemplifies the postmodernist approach.
  - While the novel grapples with subjectivity, it lacks a definitive subjective narrator and does not conform to realism.

**Key Idea**: Coetzee's "Foe" epitomizes postmodern literature by destabilizing traditional narrative structures, blurring the lines between character and narrator, and provoking readers to question the very nature of storytelling.

**Narrative Forms and Language Situations in Storytelling**

- **Emotive Function in Narration**
  - Narrators refer to themselves when expressing emotions, signifying self-reference.
  - There are different language situations: one about the contact between speaker and listener, and the other about external entities.
  - In certain contexts, narrative levels may intertwine or merge.
  - Example f.ii shows the interplay of personal and impersonal language situations, known as text interference.

- **Indicators of Personal vs. Impersonal Language Situations**
  - Personal indicators:
    - Personal pronouns like I/you.
    - First and second person grammar.
    - Certain past tenses.
    - Deictic indicators such as 'this, these', 'here', 'today, tomorrow'.
    - Emotive words and expressions.
    - Conative words and expressions, such as address, command, and question.
    - Modal verbs and adverbs indicating uncertainty.
  - Impersonal indicators:
    - Pronouns like he/she.
    - Third person grammar.
    - All past tenses.
    - Deictic indicators such as 'that/those', 'there', 'that day, the day after'.
    - Absence of emotive and conative expressions.
  - Depending on the reference signals, narratives can have a perceptible narrator or shift to a second level of personal language, which can be dramatic in nature.

- **Direct vs. Indirect Discourse**
  - Direct discourse is when an actor's speech is quoted verbatim, e.g., Elizabeth said: “I think I shall...”.
  - Indirect discourse narrates the words of an actor without quoting them directly.
    - The narrator uses words to represent what the actor might have said, losing some accuracy in the process.
    - Examples i, j, and k illustrate varying levels of accuracy in indirect discourse representation.
  - Three characteristics of indirect discourse:
    1. It's narrated at a higher level than the spoken words in the story.
    2. The narrator's text indicates that an actor's words are narrated using a declarative verb and a conjunction.
    3. Words of the actor are presented with maximum precision and elaboration.

**Key Idea**: Narration can take multiple forms and rely on different language situations, either representing direct speech or indirect discourse, with each having its indicators and nuances.

**Levels of Narration: Indirect and Free Indirect Discourse**

- **Indirect Discourse and Its Characteristics**:
  - A higher narration level than the spoken words in the fabula.
  - Narrated with a declarative verb and conjunction, or a substitute.
  - Actor's words seem to be rendered with high precision and elaboration.
- **Free Indirect Discourse (FID) Defined**:
  - A mixture or interference between the narrator’s text and actor’s text.
  - Lacks the explicit sign of indirect discourse.
  - Can be distinguished from the narrator’s text when:
    - Signals of a personal language situation refer to an actor.
    - Strikingly personal style is attributable to an actor.
    - More details about speech than necessary for the fabula's progression.
- **Variations of Representation**:
  - Direct speech: Precise text as spoken by the actor with explicit level changes.
  - Indirect speech: Narrator represents the actor's text, undergoing changes.
  - Free indirect discourse: A blend of the narrator's and actor's text.
  - Narrator’s text: No signals of the actor's personal language situation.
- **Analysis of Sentence Variations**:
  - Direct speech (m) is straightforward.
  - Indirect speech (n.i and n.ii) provides representation with varying precision.
  - Free indirect discourse (o.i and o.ii) fluctuates between actor and narrator dominance.
  - Narrator's text (p.i and p.ii) presents pure narration without actor interference.
- **Evolution from Actor to Narrator**:
  - Starting with indirect discourse, there's a diminishing representation of the actor's text.
  - Free indirect discourse exhibits interference of narrator’s text and actor’s text in varying proportions.
  - Pure narrator's text presents the words as acts, avoiding text interference.

**Key Idea**: The piece delves into the complexities of narration, distinguishing between indirect discourse, free indirect discourse, and pure narrator's text, while highlighting how each form represents or interferes with the actor's voice.

**Relationships in Narration: Primary vs. Embedded Texts**

- **Interference in Texts**:
  - When narrator's and actor's texts mix, distinct narrative levels blur.
  - Text interference can make identifying different levels challenging.
- **Narrator's vs. Actor's Texts**:
  - Narrator's text is termed “primary,” signaling its overarching role.
  - This doesn't denote superiority but indicates a hierarchical relationship.
  - Embedded actor’s text depends on the primary text, like a subordinate clause.
- **Intensity of Relationships**:
  - Relationship strength varies based on kind and intensity.
  - Quantitative aspect: More framing sentences lead to stronger dependence.
- **Examples of Embedded Texts**:
  - **Wuthering Heights**:
    - Primary narrator is the internal character, Lockwood.
    - Nelly Dean, the servant, narrates at a secondary level.
    - Her invisibility mimics the class hierarchy, making her a witness to everything.
  - **Arabian Nights**:
    - Scheherazade is the primary narrator, who tells stories to stay alive.
    - Multiple embedded narratives exist within her tales, reaching several degrees deep.
    - The structure mirrors the king's paranoid view of his wife.
    - The king's suspense relates both to the story's ending and Scheherazade's loyalty.

**Key Idea**: Narration can interweave primary and embedded texts, creating complex relationships that reflect both the structure of the narrative and broader societal themes or character perspectives.

**Relationships and Levels in Narration: Primary Fabula vs. Embedded Text**

- **Interplay between Primary and Embedded Fabula**:
  - If the embedded text tells a full story, it can overshadow the primary narrative.
  - Example: In *Arabian Nights*, Scheherazade's tale's grip makes one forget the main story's stakes.
  - The act of Scheherazade's narration is a crucial event in the primary story, emphasizing narrative's importance.
- **Functions of Embedded Stories**:
  - *Explaining the Primary Story*:
    - The embedded story can provide context or reasoning for the primary fabula.
    - Example: A woman's refusal to a marriage proposal is explained by her past experiences.
    - In some instances, this background doesn't influence the primary narrative's outcome.
  - *Influencing the Primary Fabula*:
    - The embedded story can impact the primary story's direction.
    - Example: A man, after hearing his beloved's past, might decide to give her a second chance.
- **Narration as a Creative Force**:
  - Embedded narratives are not just storytelling devices; they play a role in the narrative's overall poetic and thematic elements.
  - In novels like *Beloved*, secondary narratives help to gradually build main characters or events.
  - Narration can be seen as an act of creation, comparable to divine acts like those in Genesis.
  - The novel *Beloved* emphasizes the life-giving power of storytelling, where narrative layers contribute to its overall theme and meaning.

**Key Idea**: Narration, through primary and embedded texts, possesses a transformative and creative power that can not only provide context but can shape, influence, and breathe life into the main narrative.

**Interplay of Primary and Embedded Fabula in Narratives**

- **Importance of Intrinsic Interest:**
  - The tie between the primary and embedded texts intensifies with the degree of intrinsic interest of the fabula in both.
  - The embedded fabula in "Of Old People" intricately connects to the primary story, presenting events from “the Indies” that explain events in the primary fabula.
  
- **Dynamic Levels of Narration:**
  - Different focalizations within the subtext present views of the past, intertwined with present interpretations.
  - This dynamic plays into the narrative structure, allowing the past to influence the present.

- **Embedded Fabula and Primary Story Relationship:**
  - When minimal, the embedded text has lesser importance for the primary story.
  - If two fabulas resemble each other, they can be paraphrased to share common elements. This resemblance can be used as a "mirrortext", reflecting the primary fabula.

- **Borges's Exploration of Repetition and Resemblance:**
  - In "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote," Borges challenges conventional views on reading and writing.
  - Menard's transcription of Cervantes’s "Don Quixote" is seen as richer, even if verbally identical, emphasizing the influence of time, perspective, and historical context on interpretation.
  
- **Reversal of Reading and Writing:**
  - Reading becomes a form of rewriting. This interaction doesn’t happen in a void but in the context of the present.
  - Narratorial experiments emphasize the dynamic nature of art and literature, not as static entities but as evolving processes.

**Key Idea:** Narratives showcase the intricate relationships between primary and embedded stories, emphasizing the powerful influence of perspective, historical context, and interpretation in understanding and creating art and literature.

**Embedded Texts as Indicators for Reading Primary Fabula**

- **Paraphrase and Resemblance:**
  - If both primary and embedded fabulas share common elements when paraphrased, the embedded text serves as a sign of the primary one.
  - This embedded text within the primary story is termed as the “mirror-text”.
  
- **Mirror-text Functionality:**
  - **Positional Influence:** Depending on its location, a mirror-text can predict the primary fabula's ending.
  - **Veiling for Suspense:** Resemblance is sometimes concealed to uphold suspense. Recognizing this abstract resemblance typically happens after the primary fabula’s ending.
  - **Preserving Foreshadowing:** At times, the embedded fabula doesn't veil its resemblance, preserving its foreshadowing effect. This can lead to suspense where readers know the outcome but characters don't.
  - **Predictive vs. Retrospective:** A mirror-text towards the primary fabula’s end shifts its function from predicting the story to reflecting on what has already happened.

- **Variations in Suspense:**
  - There's a shift from the reader and character sharing suspense, to situations where only the character remains in the dark about the outcome.

- **Inflecting Significance through Mirror-text:**
  - A mere repetition of the primary story in the mirror-text isn't as captivating. Its primary role is to enhance or steer the meaning.
  - This can lift the narration to a higher, more abstract level, e.g., highlighting universal themes like inevitable fate or the individual versus bureaucracy.

- **Mirror-texts as Reading Directives:**
  - The embedded story hints at how the primary text should be read, acting as guidance for the reader's interpretation.

**Key Idea:** Embedded texts or “mirror-texts” within primary narratives serve as guides for readers, either predicting, reflecting upon, or inflecting the story’s significance.

**The Role of Mirror-Texts in Actor Interpretation and Literature**

- **Actor's Interpretation of Mirror-text:**
  - **Actor's Influence:** The actor can interpret the embedded story (mirror-text) as a sign, discerning their own story's trajectory, thus impacting its outcome.
  - **Case Study: “The Fall of the House of Usher” by Poe:**
    - The narrator saves himself by correctly interpreting the signs in the embedded text read aloud.
    - The terms “fall” and “house” have dual implications: the collapse of a building and the end of a family lineage.
    - Recognizing this duality allows the narrator to foresee impending doom, flee, and subsequently relay the tale.

- **Mirror-text's Implication in Literature:**
  - **Significance of Double Meanings:**
    - Recognizing dual meanings in literature is pivotal, as showcased in the actor's realization within the story.
    - This recognition serves as a directive or "prescription" for reading literature, emphasizing its multifaceted nature.
  - **Embedded Text as Poetics:** 
    - The embedded story not only conveys the story's events but also embodies broader notions about literature and its dual or multiple interpretations.
    - It posits that true literature possesses multiple interpretations or it doesn't qualify as literature.
  
- **Title's Indicative Power:**
  - Titles often hint at the embedded meanings, but their full depth typically requires unpacking the entire narrative. In this case, the title "The Fall of the House of Usher" is seemingly straightforward, but unveils deeper interpretations upon thorough reading.

**Key Idea:** Embedded texts or "mirror-texts" play a critical role in both influencing characters' decisions within a story and illuminating the multifaceted nature of literature itself.

**Understanding Non-Narrative Embedded Texts in Narratives**

- **Nature of Embedded Texts:**
  - **Predominantly Non-narrative:** Most embedded texts within narratives don't narrate a separate story.
  - **Variety of Forms:** They range from general assertions, discussions between actors, descriptions, confidences, to other forms.
  - **Dominance of Dialogue:** A significant form of embedded text is dialogue, where actors, not the primary narrator, produce meaning.
    - Resembles dramatic texts, which consist mainly of actor utterances.
    - The more a narrative contains dialogue, the closer it leans towards being dramatic.
    - Interventions by the primary narrator in dialogues (e.g., "Elizabeth said") maintain a clear hierarchical distinction between main and embedded text.

- **Monologues and Soliloquies:**
  - One actor's spoken or thought expressions.
  - Content can vary widely, from confidences to self-reflections.
  - They inherently don't differ from other language usage within the text.

- **Interlocution in Narratives:**
  - All narratives imply a speaker and an addressed listener.
  - The speaker's "I" is only valid with a listener's "you."
  - E.g., in *Arabian Nights*:
    - Sheherazade addresses two interlocutors: the king and her sister Dinarzade.
    - Dinarzade, hidden, prompts the story continuation while the king listens for entertainment.
    - This creates a layered narrative where Sheherazade addresses both a primary listener (the king) and offers encoded messages to her sister.

- **Relationship Between Primary and Embedded Texts:**
  - Depends on explicit commentary by N1 (the primary narrator) or implied hints.
  - The embedded text can have various relationships with the primary: continuation, explanation, similarity, contradiction, or no connection.
  - A single comment from the primary narrator can drastically alter the perceived meaning of the entire text.
  
**Key Idea:** Non-narrative embedded texts, predominantly dialogues, play crucial roles within narratives, influencing meaning, dynamics, and depth, and showcasing the complex interplay between narrators, actors, and listeners.

## Remarks

**Narrator and Author Distinction in Literature**

- **Barthes and Foucault on Authorship**
  - Roland Barthes proclaims the “death of the author”, igniting significant debate.
  - Michel Foucault challenges the conventional ideas of authorship, introducing four alternate concepts.
  - Foucault promotes a multiplicity of meanings, suggesting the author and work interact within a larger discursive field.
  
- **Concept of the Narrator**
  - The term "implied author", introduced by Wayne C. Booth, is differentiated from the narrator.
  - Concerns with the "implied author":
    - Implies a total inference of meaning from a text.
    - Can be harnessed to grant undue authority on a text's interpretation.
    - Not specific to narrative texts.
  - The commodification of the author in a neoliberal culture presents challenges for objective narrative interpretation.
  - The narrator is not merely a visible storyteller but is the agent conveying the text. Confined definition is crucial to prevent misunderstandings.

- **Textual Aspects and Linguistics**
  - Direct, indirect, and free indirect discourse pertain to the narrative agent's relationship to the object of narration.
  - The confusion between pragmatics and semantics arises from the interpretation of the implied author.
  - The term “omniscient narrator” is contested and criticized, as it suggests a fantastical and manipulative presence.

- **Narrative Techniques and Theories**
  - “Multidimensional memory” draws parallels between historical events like slavery and the Holocaust.
  - Differences between narration and nonnarrative commentary are highlighted.
  - Free indirect discourse theories, like “sentences without speaker”, raise issues of narrative responsibility.
  - Text interferences, mirror-texts, and description techniques are explored.
  - Concepts like the narratee, dialogue in language use, and intertextuality add depth to the narrative study.

- **Literary Examples and Interpretations**
  - Works such as "Nightwood", "Don Quixote", "Beloved", and "La modification" are discussed.
  - Second-person narratives and their association with postmodernism are examined.
  - The political implications of narrative techniques, like the poetics of apostrophe, are also discussed.

**Key Idea:** The relationship between the narrator and the author is intricate and multi-layered, with theorists like Barthes and Foucault challenging conventional notions of authorship, and various narrative techniques enriching the fabric of storytelling.

# 2 Story: Aspects

## 1: Preliminary Remarks

**Summary: Understanding Narrative Aspects and Manipulation**

- **Defining Aspects**: 
  - Features distinguishing a structured story from its text and the fabula.
  - Story seen as the result of ordering – a product of subjectivization.
  
- **Role of Textual Analysis**: 
  - Aims to discern the conditions of the reception process.
  - Explores why the same fabula may be perceived differently based on its presentation or medium.
  
- **Manipulation in Narrative**:
  - Refers to the treatment of the fabula.
  - Manipulation guides reader interpretation. It's not just about creating characters but ensuring events form a coherent story.
  
- **Importance of Perspective**:
  - Critical means of manipulation in storytelling.
  - Determines how elements of the fabula are presented and, consequently, their meaning to the reader.
  
- **Focalization**:
  - Technical aspect placing the point of view with a specific agent.
  - Main tool for subjectifying the story, making it more personal and relatable.
  
- **Story Logic and Expectations**:
  - Depending on the narrative's nature (classical, realist, modernist, etc.), readers have specific expectations.
  - Annoyance arises when there are unexplained deviations or inconsistencies.
  
- **Randomness in Storytelling**:
  - Some story aspects may appear random but have deeper meaning.
  - The concept of randomness in storytelling is relative based on reader expectations and acceptance.

**Key Idea**: Narratives are subjectivized through aspects and manipulations, with perspective and focalization playing critical roles in influencing readers' interpretations and reactions.

## 2: Temporality

**Summary: The Complexity and Intricacies of Temporality in Narratives**

- **Understanding Temporality**:
  - Time is a fundamental aspect of narrative arts such as theatre, film, music, etc.
  - Yet, narratives introduce complexities to the straightforward concept of time.
  
- **Contrasting Timescales**:
  - Regulated time (clocks, schedules) differs from monumental and historical time perceptions.
  - Monumental time aims for eternity, contrasting the transient nature of daily experiences.
  - Micro-time: Brief moments and short-lived experiences, like a mother's interrupted sleep pattern with a newborn.
  
- **Immigrant’s Experience of Time**:
  - The journey of undocumented immigrants showcases the profound complexities of temporality.
  - Intense moments during border crossings, waiting periods, rushing and stagnation coexisting.
  - Lingering in the present due to uncertainties, causing past memories to be frozen and creating a sense of disenfranchisement.
  
- **Temporal Depth in "Arabian Nights"**:
  - The king is bound by day-to-day time, representing his fears (chronophobia and gynophobia).
  - Sheherazade manipulates temporality, borrowing time from the narratives she shares to keep the king intrigued.
  - The story highlights different forms of temporality: the duration of storytelling, the events within the stories, and the suspense in-between.

- **Narrative Techniques to Evoke Temporal Experiences**:
  - Narratives utilize specific devices to craft varied experiences of time for readers.
  - These devices evoke the characterizations of different temporal experiences as mentioned earlier.

**Key Idea**: Narratives delve deep into the complexities of time, presenting multifaceted temporal experiences that intertwine personal experiences with broader societal contexts.

## 3: Sequential Ordering

**Complexities of Sequential Ordering in Narratives**

- **Inherent Linearity vs. Narrative Reality**:
  - All written texts, including narratives, exhibit inherent linearity where one word or image follows another.
  - Narratives often deviate from this inherent linearity, presenting events out of chronological order.
  - This deviation, though non-linear in nature, creates intense reading experiences, making readers engage deeply with the text.

- **Types of Deviations: Examples**
  - Events may be presented contrary to logical sequence, as exemplified by John's ringing the doorbell and his underlying desire.
  - Anachronies or chronological deviations can be subtle or profound, requiring readers to piece together the intended sequence.

- **Purpose and Impact of Deviations**:
  - Breaking linearity compels more intensive reading and reflection.
  - Playing with sequential ordering serves many functions:
    - Drawing attention
    - Emphasizing certain events or feelings
    - Creating suspense
    - Showing various interpretations of an event
    - Highlighting the difference between expectation and realization.

- **Narrative Techniques and Examples**:
  - Some narratives use chronological deviations for effect, such as the child’s alternating memories in the book "Something Very Sorry."
  - Techniques of chronological deviation differ across narratives, from the intricate plays on time in Gabriel García Márquez’s "One Hundred Years of Solitude" to the simple yet profound waiting sequence in Marguerite Duras’s "L’après-midi de Monsieur Andesmas."
  - Anachrony can be used for both structural and thematic purposes.

- **Complexity of Anachronies**:
  - Anachronies can be subtle, making even seemingly chronological narratives complex upon deeper examination.
  - Some novels, like the classic 19th-century realistic novels, begin in medias res and use anachrony to weave the narrative together.
  - The application of sequential ordering and chronological deviations differs across narratives, offering varying reader experiences and interpretations.

**Key Idea**: 
Sequential ordering in narratives is a sophisticated tool that, while breaking inherent linearity, intensifies reading experiences, adds depth to storytelling, and emphasizes various thematic concerns.

**Chronological Manipulation in Storytelling**

- **Introduction to Anachrony**:
  - Anachrony refers to events that are presented out of their chronological order.
  - The term is divided into two categories: retroversion (past) and anticipation (future).
  - The terms "flashback" and "flashforward" are avoided due to their vagueness and psychological connotations.

- **Example from Homer’s Iliad**:
  - The beginning of the Iliad provides a comprehensive anachrony, starting with Achilles' grudge.
  - There's a series of causes and effects demonstrating how the narrative unfolds out of order.
  - Formula representation of this anachrony is A4-B5-C3-D2-E1.

- **Purpose of Anachrony**:
  - This storytelling technique offers a glimpse of what the story entails at its commencement.
  - It emphasizes the influence of external powers on human events and destinies.
  - A summarization presented in the beginning can encapsulate the entirety of the book's content.

- **Modern Story Example – Harry Mulisch’s “What Happened to Sergeant Massuro?”**:
  - This story provides another take on chronological manipulation with a different sequential ordering.
  - Harry Mulisch's life, including his experiences during the war and his beliefs about art, profoundly influences his writing.
  - The narrative discusses Massuro's transformation into stone during an expedition.
  - Symbolic structures in the story are compared to Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.
  - The formula for this anachrony is A5-B4-C3-D6-E2-F1-G2.

- **Importance of Contrast and Violation of Chronology**:
  - The story presents contrasts, such as the difference between familiar and exotic names.
  - The disruption of chronological sequence helps depict underlying confusion in the fabula.

**Key Idea**: Chronological manipulation, or anachrony, in storytelling, allows authors to emphasize key themes, create contrasts, and provide comprehensive summaries at the outset of their narratives, guiding readers through a more profound understanding of the tale.

**Understanding Anachrony in Literature**

- **Nuances of Anachrony**:
  - Different levels of chronological deviations exist, some are in the consciousness, and some reflect actual time deviations.
    - The complexity of anachrony can emulate visual perception.
    - Distinguishing between what is a "real" chronological deviation and what is not can be intricate.
  - Not all anachronies are of equal narrative importance.
    - Some texts might center around "unreal" anachronies.
    - Defining the primary time in a story is essential but can be contentious.
    - The narrative of Patrick Chamoiseau’s "Texaco" showcases how the past can impact and rearrange the present narrative.
  - Differentiating between "false" anachronies and others requires the classification of subjective and objective.
    - Subjective anachronies exist only when the contents of consciousness dwell in the past or future, not in the consciousness itself.
  - Determining specific periods in fabula can sometimes be challenging due to overlapping timelines and intricate narrative structures.

- **Sequential Ordering and Its Challenges**:
  - Analysis of "stream-of-consciousness" literature is exempt from chronological scrutiny.
  - The distinction between real anachrony and the moment of speech becomes blurred in direct discourses, making analysis intricate.
  - Positioning narrative units relative to each other is crucial, even if deciding on a primary time isn't.
    - Some texts present a convoluted relationship between story and fabula, making exhaustive analysis impractical.
    - Genette’s analysis of Proust’s novel showcases this relativity in time units.
  - Anachronies can be embedded within one another, making dissection complex.
    - E.g., The retroversion in John's lament about marrying Mary presents multiple layers of time interpretation.
  - Some words or contexts, like "bank," introduce ambiguities. This uncertainty in interpretation can be intentional for producing effects like humor or confusion.

- **Key Idea**: Anachrony in literature presents layered deviations from chronological order, leading to intricate narrative structures and deeper thematic exploration. While some deviations are more perceptual or subjective, others reshape the narrative's core structure, underscoring the multifaceted nature of time in storytelling.

**Anachrony and Its Impact on Sequential Ordering**

- **Defining Anachrony**:
  - An anachrony involves events separated by a time interval from the present, disrupting the story's current development.
  - Anachrony can be divided based on distance from the primary fabula.

- **Types of Anachrony Based on Distance**:
  - **Retroversion**:
    - **External Retroversion**: Occurs entirely outside the primary fabula's time span.
    - **Internal Retroversion**: Takes place within the time span of the primary fabula.
    - **Mixed Retroversion**: Starts outside the primary time span and ends within it.
  - **Anticipation**:
    - Three categories similar to retroversion: external, internal, and mixed. However, these are less common.

- **Examples and Applications**:
  - **Massuro's Arrival**:
    - Occurs two years before the letter writing.
    - The doctor’s examination and letter writing come after Massuro’s death and are parts of the process to certify the cause of death, which spans six days.
  - **Butor’s La modification**:
    - Primary story-time involves a train journey from Paris to Rome.
    - Flashbacks span years, reflecting on a broken marriage. All flashbacks are subjective in nature.
  - **Categorizing Retroversion**:
    - Retroversion can be internal or external based on which period is considered primary.
      - Example: Massuro's story becomes an internal retroversion if the period from renewed acquaintance to letter writing is primary. If only the letter writing is primary, retroversion is external.

- **Making Choices on Primary Time Span**:
  - Ideally, the choice should account for most phenomena within the story.
  - E.g., Considering the period between meeting and letter writing as primary seems logical for Massuro's story. This means that some retroversions can be classified as mixed, starting before and continuing until a particular event.

- **Key Idea**: Anachrony, based on distance from the primary fabula, provides tools to understand events' chronological deviations, enhancing narrative depth and structure.

**Functions and Impacts of Retroversion in Storytelling**

- **Subjective Retroversions in "La modification"**:
  - Serve to explain a man's dissatisfaction with his wife and apprehensions about confronting his mistress.
  - Reinforce the idea that dissatisfaction is inherently subjective, thereby highlighting potential political implications in storytelling.

- **Anecdotes and Relationships in "Sergeant Massuro"**:
  - Recollection of a past anecdote reveals an unspoken bond between two individuals.
  - Enhances understanding of their present relationship and explains the narrator's struggle to comprehend Massuro’s unexplained death.
  - Suggests a colonial theme, implying a hidden narrative depth related to colonial experiences.
  - Adds to the growing atmosphere of mystery within the story.

- **Function of External Retroversions**:
  - Provides background or historical context about characters that are essential for understanding current events.

- **Characteristics and Functions of Internal Retroversions**:
  - Can either overlap with the primary narrative or offer fresh insights.
    - When introducing new characters, reveals their past actions or motivations that later prove crucial.
    - When overlapping, they often fill gaps left in the primary story, supplying missing information.
  - In some narratives, like Victorian novels, certain ellipses are intentionally left out (e.g., childbirth) for decency.
  - Internal retroversions can also revisit and expand upon past events, altering or enhancing their meaning.
    - Can present the same event in a different light, altering its significance.
    - Utilized in works like Proust's for reflecting on the past and in detective novels for adding twists to the story.

- **Key Idea**: Retroversion in storytelling, whether subjective, external, or internal, provides depth, fills gaps, and can shift the interpretation of events, enriching narrative complexity and perspective.



**Understanding Anachrony in Literature**

- **Anachrony's Span and Distance**:
  - Span represents the duration covered by an anachrony (like a flashback or foreshadowing). For example, the span could be a month, while the distance (the gap between the main narrative and the anachrony) could be a year.
  - In Couperus’s "Of Old People," the murder references have a 60-year distance, varying spans, and are examples of incomplete anachronies.

- **Incomplete vs. Complete Anachrony**:
  - Incomplete: Only parts of the event or situation are recalled, leaving gaps.
  - Complete: The entire event or situation is recalled, from beginning to end.

- **Classical Illustrations**:
  - Beginning a narrative "in medias res" is a common use of anachrony. An example is when a story starts mid-plot, and earlier events are then recalled.
  - "Odyssey" Book 19 demonstrates an incomplete retroversion about Ulysses's scar and its origin.

- **Punctual vs. Durative Anachrony**:
  - Punctual: Evokes a specific moment in time, like the exact time Ulysses got his wound.
  - Durative: Covers a longer period, such as the days Ulysses's wound was healing.

- **Usage of Punctual and Durative Forms in Literature**:
  - Different combinations can influence the narrative style.
  - For example, Proust's "À la recherche du temps perdu" masterfully alternates between punctual and durative retroversions.

- **Example from "Migas de pan"**:
  - The novel showcases the trauma of time repetition. A captured Holocaust survivor's past trauma is echoed in the present experiences of his family.
  - The story line revolves around a "tragedy without crisis," emphasizing the endless anticipation and effect of time.

- **The Role of Time in the Narrative**:
  - In the novel, the son's perspective on time shifts, influenced by his father's traumatic history and their current ordeal. The home becomes a representation of time imprisonment.
  - The experience transcends mere postmemory, as the son feels trapped in a repetition of unexperienced events.

**Key Idea**: Anachrony in literature, whether incomplete or complete and punctual or durative, influences narrative style and structure, offering depth to storytelling and altering characters' and readers' perception of time.

**Summary: Concepts of Anticipation and Sequential Ordering in Narratives**

- **Anachrony and Anticipation**
  - Anachrony is relevant to both retroversions and anticipations.
  - Anticipations can hint at the end of the fabula, impacting tension and overall narrative perception.

- **Opening Summaries**
  - Traditional anticipations sometimes begin with a summary that foreshadows the end.
  - This form diminishes suspense about the ending but can increase interest in the unfolding of events.

- **First-person Novels and Future References**
  - Narratives with a CN (first-person novels) are apt for future references.
  - A narrative presenting its past can allude to its future, creating layers of time perspectives.

- **Uncertainty in Narratives**
  - Stories, like "La modification," can create tension by keeping some events uncertain.
  - This uncertainty can affect the reader's engagement and interpretation.

- **Implicit Hints in Madame Bovary**
  - "Madame Bovary" contains implicit anticipations that challenge their own readability.
  - Such hints shift the novel's genre from realist to (post)modernist.

- **Types of Anticipations**
  - Can be grouped as internal or external.
  - Internal anticipations clarify events, connecting past and future events in the narrative.
  - Iterative anticipations present events as a recurring series, balancing between repetition and novelty.

- **Promise and Fulfilment in L’aprèsmidi de Monsieur Andesmas**
  - The tension arises from an unfulfilled promise, with the narrative revolving around waiting.
  - Temporal play creates emotional suspense.

- **Distinction Between Announcements and Hints**
  - Announcements are explicit about future events, while hints are implicit.
  - Announcements might reduce suspense, but hints can increase it.
  - False hints or details can manipulate readers' anticipation and suspense.

**Key Idea:** 
Anticipations in narratives, whether explicit or implicit, play a critical role in shaping readers' engagement, understanding, and suspense throughout the story.

**Understanding Achrony and Temporal Deviations in Narratives**

* **Definition of Achrony**
  * A deviation of time in a story that cannot be further analyzed due to ambiguous or insufficient information.
  
* **Examples of Temporal Deviations Resembling Achrony**
  * **Anticipation-within-Retroversion**: A forward reference within a back-reference. It contrasts the expected present with the realized present.
    * When used, it can highlight the fictionality of the fabula or main story.
  * **Retroversion-within-Anticipation**: Foretelling how current situations will be revealed in the future.
    * It foreshadows an upcoming realization or revelation.
  * **Anticipation vs. Retroversion**: Events yet to happen chronologically may have already been portrayed in the story, creating a temporal discrepancy.
  
* **Definite Achrony Forms**
  * **Undated Achrony**: Does not indicate its direction, distance, or span.
    * Example: "I have never seen him without his wig."
  * **Grouping by Non-Chronological Criteria**: Events ordered by criteria other than time, like spatial connections.
    * Proust and modernists like Virginia Woolf used such visual, non-chronological narrative styles.
  
* **The Disconnect Between Linearity of Fabula and Presentation**
  * The chronological order of events in the story and their presentation can sometimes lack correspondence.
  
* **Temporal Distortions in 'Migas de pan'**
  * The novel by Azriel Bibliowicz uses achrony as its main trope.
  * Addresses the trauma of the Holocaust and its effects on subsequent generations.
  * The novel’s focus on captivity reflects the sense of time and trauma as a form of captivity.
  * Emphasizes the deep sense of time through spatial arrangements and reflections.
  
* **Achrony’s Broader Significance in Literature**
  * A way to represent trauma, nonlinear experiences, and challenge traditional narrative conceptions of time.

**Key Idea**: Achrony and other temporal deviations offer a unique narrative tool to represent non-linear experiences, trauma, and challenge conventional understandings of time within literature.
## 4: Rhythm

**Understanding Narrative Rhythm in Media**

- **Background of Narrative Rhythm**
  - Narrative rhythm plays a key role in media, particularly film, but remains under-analyzed.
  - Historically, Percy Lubbock (1921) introduced concepts of summarizing vs. scenic presentations; followed by extensive studies by Günther Müller in Germany.
  - Main query: How can one define and measure the speed and rhythm of a narrative?

- **Measuring Time in Narratives**
  - Estimation of time covered by events can be calculated, akin to how speed is calculated in traffic.
  - The comparison is made by juxtaposing time of events with the space (pages, lines, words) they occupy in the text.
  - Central to any analysis is the relevance of the study; it's not just about exact word counts but understanding how attention is distributed in a story.

- **Overall Rhythm & Episode Emphasis**
  - Using a 19th-century life-story as an example: Different life phases (e.g., childhood, first love, decline) can be evaluated based on pages dedicated to each phase.
  - Analysis can reveal disproportionate emphasis; e.g., childhood may be brief while first love is elaborated.
  - Example from Dickens’ Dombey and Son highlights rhythm in narrative progression.
  
- **Distinctions in Narrative Presentation**
  - Percy Lubbock's 'The Craft of Fiction' differentiates between scene (detailed presentation) and summary.
  - Ellipsis: Parts of the story-time (fabula) given no attention at all.
  - Pause: An element with no fabula-time is given extensive attention.
  - These concepts are relative, necessitating a "norm tempo" or standard for comparison.
  - Assumption: Dialogues in narratives occur in real-time; they function as the baseline.

- **Five Narrative Tempi**
  - Every narrative can be broken into five distinct speeds:
    1. **Ellipsis** where fabula-time greatly outweighs story-time.
    2. **Summary** where fabula-time is more than story-time.
    3. **Scene** where both times are equal.
    4. **Slow-down** where fabula-time is lesser than story-time.
    5. **Pause** where there's extensive story-time for minimal fabula-time.

*Key Idea:* The essence of the text emphasizes the critical role of rhythm in narrative media, the historical attempts to understand it, and the methodologies to analyze and categorize the pacing of stories into five distinct tempos.


**Narrative Rhythm and Its Forms**

- **Introduction to Rhythmic Analysis**
    - Background rhythm in narrative media, especially film, remains elusive.
    - Percy Lubbock (1921) and Günther Müller (1968) made efforts to understand narrative rhythm.
    - Central challenge: comparing the time of the story's events (fabula) with its presentation in the narrative.

- **Methods for Estimating Rhythmic Speed**
    - Speed is judged by comparing fabula time with space in the text (pages, lines, words).
    - Analyses aim to determine how attention is distributed across the story.
    - Attention patterns reflect the vision communicated to the reader.

- **Determination of General Rhythm**
    - A life-story approach is used to show rhythm, using the example of a hero's life journey.
    - The novel "Dombey and Son" by Dickens is cited as a rhythm example.
    - Lubbock distinguishes between scene (detailed presentation) and summary (quick overview).

- **Ellipsis**
    - Represents a gap in the story where an event is omitted.
    - Important events can be elided due to emotional weight, linguistic challenges, or actor denial.
    - Examples of pseudo-ellipsis and mini-summary were given, demonstrating gradation in the omission.

- **Summary**
    - Presents background events in a concise manner.
    - Climactic events tend to be presented in detail, while insignificant events are summarized.
    - "Oliver Twist" by Dickens and "Madame Bovary" by Flaubert are used as contrasting examples of rhythm.
    - Flaubert's unique technique offers both realistic and (proto-)postmodern perspectives.

**Key Idea:** Narrative rhythm, understood through forms like ellipsis and summary, reveals the pattern of attention and significance in storytelling, with the rhythm aligning with the fabula's essence.

**Understanding Narrative Tempos: Scene and Slow-Down**

- **The Predominance of Scenes**
    - In novels, scenes are a primary narrative form.
    - Previously, there was a balance between summary and scene; modern narratives often deviate from this pattern.
    - *Example: Madame Bovary*
        - Scenes in the novel often illustrate repetitive events.
        - The detailed portrayal of Emma's regular visits to her lover suggests the monotony of her life.
    - *Proust's Variation*
        - Proust's "À la recherche du temps perdu" uses scenes as anticipations of future similar events.
        - Scenes emphasize the intensity of a first-time experience.

- **Characteristics of a Scene**
    - Duration of the event and its portrayal are nearly identical.
    - Genuine synchronicity, where event duration matches its portrayal, is hard to achieve.
    - Scenes often include retroversions, anticipations, observations, and descriptions.
    - *Example: Sterne’s Tristram Shandy (1767)*
        - Explored the challenge of portraying real-time events.
    - Marguerite Duras is highlighted as one who tries to capture genuine conversation but still has to condense it.
    - Scenes can be central narrative moments, serving as pivots for the story's direction.

- **Slow-Down Tempo**
    - Contrasts with summary, portraying events slower than they occur.
    - Difficult to achieve; full synchronicity can make the narrative feel too sluggish.
    - Used for moments of intense suspense or significance.
    - Can be used within a scene to emphasize tension or heightened emotion.
    - *Example: Receiving a visitor or letter*
        - The anticipation and array of emotions before the door is opened can be drawn out for dramatic effect.

**Key Idea:** In narrative storytelling, the tempo plays a crucial role in conveying emotions, emphasizing monotony, or building suspense, with scenes and slow-downs being instrumental in dictating the pace and intensity of events.

**Exploring Narrative Pauses Across Literary Eras**

- **Definition of Pause**
    - Refers to narrative sections where no progression of story-time (fabula-time) occurs.
    - Focuses intensely on a singular element, while the overarching narrative remains static.

- **Contrast with Slow-Down**
    - While both retard the narrative, pauses halt fabula-time entirely, whereas slow-downs signify a reduced passage of time.

- **Historical Perspectives on Pauses**
    - *Homer’s Approach*
        - Pauses are generally avoided in works like the "Odyssey".
        - Descriptions replaced by retroversions, changing time sequences but maintaining narrative flow.
    - *Naturalism Era*
        - Pauses became more prevalent to depict a realistic representation of life.
        - Extensive descriptions and expositions were norms.
    - *Post-Naturalist Narrative*
        - Emulated Naturalist style but concealed the pauses more artfully.
        - *Example: Zola’s Novels*
            - Actors observe an object, and its description follows.
            - Use of perception verbs and adverbs indicate a subtle passage of time, transforming a pause into a scene.

- **Modernist and Postmodernist Approaches**
    - *Modernist Narrative (e.g., Virginia Woolf)*
        - Combines detailed descriptions with the portrayal of slow-paced events.
        - Often blurs the line between object description and event narration.
    - *Postmodernism*
        - Traditional notions of narrative rhythm and pauses become less defined.
        - Challenges conventional literary structures, making delineation of pauses even more intricate.

**Key Idea:** The narrative pause, a moment where the story's progress halts to delve into detail, has evolved in its application across literary eras, reflecting changing perspectives on storytelling rhythm and the depiction of reality.

**Narrative Rhythms and Their Depictions in Literature**

- **Narrative Techniques**
    - *Ellipsis:* Omission of expected events.
    - *Summary:* Quick rundown of events taking longer in actuality.
    - *Scene:* Detailed portrayal of a single event.
    - *Slow-down:* Stretches time beyond simultaneity, elongating an event.
  
- **Paradox of Narrative**
    - Despite linearity and chronology, narratives can't depict every moment due to the resulting sluggishness.
    - *Example: L’étranger by Albert Camus*
        - Chronological sequence is followed.
        - Consists of pseudo-scenes that accelerate the narrative with implied ellipses.
  
- **Depicting Time and Emptiness**
    - Novels such as "The Evenings" show rapidity of time alongside the vast emptiness of its passage.
    - Scene form can suggest the sensation of ample time and its fleeting nature simultaneously.
    - *Example: L’après-midi de Monsieur Andesmas*
        - Time dilation occurs when waiting for a significant event. Here, Andesmas's daughter's return is emphasized but occurs outside the narrative.
  
- **Moments of Slow-Down in World Literature**
    - *Example: Marcel's Kiss in "À la recherche" by Proust*
        - The kiss's significance lies in the detailed sensory experiences rather than the act itself.
        - Slow-down explores nuances of perception and sensorial imperfections.
        - Act of kissing becomes an epistemological study of the body's senses.

- **Story vs. Fabula**
    - In some narratives, the overarching fabula (plot) is overshadowed by the intricacies of the story itself.
    - Intense details can morph events into elongated descriptive flows, altering the perception of time and event.

**Key Idea:** Literature utilizes various narrative techniques, such as ellipses and slow-downs, to depict time and events, often delving deep into sensory experiences and perceptions, making the distinction between overarching plots and intricate story details hard to distinguish.
## 5: Frequencies

**Understanding the Concept of Frequency in Storytelling**

- **Definition of Frequency:**
  - Gérard Genette defines it as the numerical relationship between events in the fabula (the raw material of a story) and events in the actual story.
  - Repetition plays a key role, even though two identical texts or events can still be seen as distinct due to the context or sequence.

- **Repetition of Events:**
  - Events can seem repetitive due to their similarity. The audience often overlooks minor differences, focusing on the likeness.
  - Even if an event happens only once, its representation multiple times in a story is seen as repetition.
  - Stylistic variations or perspective shifts can disguise repetitions.

- **Types of Frequency:**
  - Singular presentation: One event presented once.
  - Plurisingular: Multiple events presented multiple times, equally.
  - Varisingular: Multiple events presented multiple times, but unequal in presentation.
  - Repetitive: One event presented multiple times.
  - Iterative: Multiple events presented once.

- **Iterative Presentation:**
  - Presents a series of identical events at once.
  - Historically used as a background to singular events.
  - Flaubert and Proust extensively employed iteration, with Proust using pseudo-iteration to push modernist anti-realism.
  - Three forms of iteration:
    - Generalizing: Presents general facts beyond the fabula.
    - Fabula-specific: Events exceeding the fabula's time span, termed external iterations.
    - Fabula-specific within its time span: Mentioned only once but felt multiple times.

- **Postmodernist Iteration:**
  - Functions differently; example from Acker's "Blood and Guts" demonstrates ambiguity in frequency.
  
- **Flaubert's Mastery:**
  - Used rhythm in storytelling to predict outcomes and undercut suspense.
  - Example from "Madame Bovary" demonstrates how verb tenses can indicate routine while subtly foreshadowing the story's trajectory.

**Key Idea:**  
Frequency in storytelling encompasses the relationship between raw events and their representation in a narrative, with repetition and iteration playing critical roles in shaping audience perception and narrative depth.

**Heterochrony and the Multifaceted Experience of Time**

- **Concept of Heterochrony:**
  - While others refer to this idea as “polychrony,” the term heterochrony emphasizes difference over mere multiplicity.
  - Represents the experience of time as multiple and distinct, especially evident in the context of migration.
  
- **Exemplification through Migration:**
  - Migration illuminates time as a mix of rapidity and stasis, memories and an unpredictable present.
  - From an external viewpoint, this is termed multi-temporality, while the personal experience is termed heterochrony.
  
- **Distinction between Multi-temporality and Heterochrony:**
  - Multi-temporality: An always-existing phenomenon, overshadowed by linear, measurable time in societal constructs.
  - Heterochrony: Can be both a distressing and fulfilling personal experience, similar to the contrasting experiences of having the flu versus a deeply meaningful day.
  
- **Interplay with Media and Culture:**
  - Both video storytelling and the experiences of migration amplify feelings of heterochrony.
  - Typically, time's diverse nuances are reduced to its chronological aspect, which can impose a sense of insufficiency, especially on those not aligned with local "chrono-logic."

- **Chronology vs. Heterochrony:**
  - Chronology, in its linear nature, casts a shadow of inadequacy over the experience of time.
  - Heterochrony extends beyond mere personal experience and impacts the temporal fabric of our cultural world. Recognizing and understanding it becomes a political necessity.
  
- **Narrative's Role in Unpacking Time:**
  - Narrative forms, due to their ability to manipulate time, are pivotal in understanding and developing sensitivity towards the myriad ways cultural experience interacts with time.

**Key Idea:**  
Heterochrony represents the multifaceted experience of time in both individual and cultural contexts, highlighting the necessity to comprehend time beyond linear chronology.

## 6: Characters
**The Nature and Significance of Characters in Narrative**

- **Definition and Role of Characters:**
  - Narrative thrives on the emotional pull of characters, whether likable or not.
  - Characters are anthropomorphic figures described by the narrator with specific features that create a unique character-effect.
  - Difference between 'character' and 'actor':
    - A character typically resembles a human, while an actor may not.
    - A character is seen as the effect when a figure is presented with distinct, mostly human traits, while an actor in the fabula is a structural position.

- **Interactions with Characters:**
  - Readers connect with characters, feeling emotions alongside them, and forming likes or dislikes.
  - The goal is not just to identify characters but to understand their nature and how readers perceive them.

- **Anthropomorphic Complexity of Characters:**
  - Characters mimic real people, yet they are fictional constructs stemming from fantasy, imitation, and memory.
  - No comprehensive theory of character exists, primarily due to their human-like but non-human nature.
  - Characters might not have real personalities, ideologies, or actions, but they exhibit traits that allow readers to perceive them as such.
  
- **Character-Effect Phenomenon:**
  - Characters don’t truly exist, but narratives give an illusion of their existence.
  - This character-effect arises when the resemblance between fictional figures and humans is so pronounced that readers forget the inherent difference, even identifying or emoting with the characters.

- **Potential Misinterpretations and Pitfalls:**
  - Over-identification with characters can lead to irrelevant questions, reducing narratives to mere realism.
  - Misjudging characters as contemporary, psychologically profound individuals has negatively influenced literary studies.
    - Example: Misinterpretations in ancient and folk literature, or misunderstandings of characters from non-Western narratives.
    - This misjudgment can overshadow diverse storytelling modes differing from the modern Western perspective.

**Key Idea:**  
Characters serve as the emotional backbone of narratives, offering anthropomorphic illusions that deeply resonate with readers, but also pose potential misinterpretations and challenges in understanding diverse storytelling forms.

**Character Dynamics in Narratives**

- **Adherence to Textual Presentation:**
  - To achieve fresh insights, focus solely on what the text presents.
  - Avoid conforming characters to readers’ expectations to experience a text as new.
  
- **Character Construction and Anthropomorphism:**
  - Readers often form psychological portraits based on their own biases rather than text-story-fabula interplay.
  - Separating from this anthropomorphism is vital.
  - Character portrayal isn't just based on feelings or looks but also actions.
  
- **Traditional Character Categorizations:**
  - E.M. Forster’s 1927 distinction:
    - Round characters: Complex and evolving.
    - Flat characters: Stereotypical and unchanging.
  - Such classifications don't apply to genres like fairy tales, detective fiction, or certain ancient/modernist/postmodern narratives.
  - Aim to develop a framework for characterizing narrative characters to elucidate the character-effect.
  
- **Influence of Reality on Character Perception:**
  - Characters can be influenced by real-world contexts.
  - Example: President Eisenhower in Coover’s *The Public Burning* is not the factual president but a portrayal influenced by historical context.
  - The realistic portrayal is often shaped by reader's personal situation, knowledge, and historical context.

- **Ideological Influence and Misinterpretations:**
  - Characters can be unduly colored by the unconscious biases of critics.
  - Critics may project emotions onto characters as if they were real people.
  - Example: Controversy surrounding Nabokov’s *Lolita* and the character Humbert.
  - It's crucial to differentiate between a character's morality and the novel's overall morality.
  - Discussions should recognize these complexities for richer narrative analysis.

**Key Idea:**  
Character understanding in narratives is influenced by textual presentation, reader biases, and external contexts, making it imperative to differentiate between character portrayals and deeper narrative intentions.

**Character Analysis in Literature**

- **Restriction to Textual Evidence**
  - Focus on the actual words of the text, avoiding external influences.
  - Allow characters to present themselves without forcing them into preconceived notions.
  - Avoid reducing characters to mere psychological profiles based on reader expectations.

- **Forster’s Character Distinction**
  - E.M. Forster's 1927 distinction categorized characters as round or flat.
  - Round characters: complex and capable of evolution.
  - Flat characters: stable, predictable, and stereotypical.
  - Not all literature fits these categories; some genres or modernist works may defy them.

- **Character Determination & Predictability**
  - Characters can be determined and made predictable by bits of information.
  - Some information connects to external situations known to the reader, providing a frame of reference.
  - Historical or legendary characters can be predetermined by their known traits or actions.

- **Referential Characters**
  - Characters, whether historical, legendary, or mythical, carry pre-existing expectations.
  - The story's portrayal either meets or challenges these expectations, affecting reader perception.
  - These characters offer a confrontation between the reader’s knowledge and the narrative presentation.

- **Misinterpretations & Traps**
  - Familiarity can lead to incorrect assumptions, as with Oedipus' misunderstood character.
  - Characters lack unconscious motives, unlike real people.
  - Psychoanalytic criticism should focus on textual impact rather than diagnosing characters.

**Key Idea:** Characters in literature should be understood based on textual evidence, without succumbing to external biases or simplifications, recognizing that they can carry pre-existing references or defy expectations.

**Character Construction in Narrative**

- **Introduction of Characters**
  - Initially, characters are introduced with limited information.
  - The reader's understanding evolves as the story progresses and the character's traits become clearer.

- **Repetition**
  - Repeated presentation of character traits solidifies the image of the character.
  - Through consistent portrayal, the character's essence becomes more apparent.

- **Accumulation of Data**
  - Gathering multiple character traits helps form a holistic image.
  - Individual facts or characteristics combine to create a cohesive portrayal of the character.

- **Relations and Interactions**
  - A character’s relationships with others shape their image.
  - Interactions, both with other characters and with their past selves, provide context and depth.
  - Relationships can be framed as similarities or contrasts, reflecting cultural cognitive patterns.

- **Character Transformations**
  - Characters may undergo changes that alter their foundational traits.
  - Identifying primary characteristics aids in recognizing and describing these transformations.

- **Narratological Analysis**
  - A constant interplay exists between speculative understanding and verifiable analysis.
  - Constructing a character involves a back-and-forth between forming ideas and confirming them through the narrative.

**Key Idea:** In narratives, the construction of a character is an intricate process involving repetition, accumulation of traits, interactions, and transformations, all synthesized through a blend of speculation and direct textual analysis.

**Character Construction and Semantic Axes**

- **Definition of Semantic Axes**
  - Pairs of opposing meanings (e.g., large–small, rich–poor).
  - Used to focus on the most important traits of characters.
  - Selection can reflect the ideological position of the analyst and story.

- **Mapping of Characters**
  - Semantic axes help identify similarities and differences between characters.
  - Characters can be mapped based on their qualifications: positive, negative, or unmarked.
  - e.g., A farmer/father might be marked as strong and diligent, whereas a student/son might be seen as weak.

- **Binary Opposition and its Limitations**
  - Simplifies character traits into two polar opposites.
  - Can be problematic due to reduction, polarization, and hierarchization.
  - Some characters can be seen as synonymous based on shared traits.
  - Differences of degree and modality within qualifications can refine understanding.

- **Ideological Implications**
  - The model can either impose ideology on the text or reveal the text’s ideological beliefs.
  - Connections among characteristics can indicate prevalent societal views.
  - e.g., In some old novels, male characters might align with military ideology.

- **Unmarked Characters**
  - Some characters might not fit clearly within established semantic axes.
  - The lack of marking can indicate their societal position or other nuances.
  - The binary opposition can help highlight these ideological stances.

- **Characters in Context**
  - Beyond comparisons, characters also relate to their situations and environments.
  - The character's role and actions in the story can influence and be influenced by the story's events.
  - Changes in a character's makeup can affect the narrative and the character's relations.

**Key Idea:** Character construction in literature often relies on semantic axes, which are pairs of opposing meanings, to highlight essential traits and ideological positions. However, this binary approach can be both revealing and limiting, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of characters in their narrative context.

**Character Qualifications and Interpretations in Literary Analysis**

- **Sources of Character Information**
  - *Self-Analysis:* Characters evaluate themselves, though they might be unreliable or biased. Genres like autobiographies are rich in this method.
    - Example: Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart" where the protagonist claims sanity while showcasing insanity.
  - *Discussion among Characters:* One character's perception of another can lead to confrontations and differing perspectives.
  - *Narrator's Statements:* An external source, the narrator, describes characters, but they can be biased or ironic.
    - Example: The depiction of Dombey in Dickens’s "Dombey and Son" is presented ironically.

- **Implicit vs. Explicit Qualifications**
  - *Implicit Qualifications:* Drawn from a character's actions or the reactions of others, based on the reader's frame of reference.
    - Example: A deserter may be seen as a coward or a pacifist depending on interpretation.
  - *Explicit Qualifications:* Direct statements or actions that label or define a character.
    - Example: A detective directly labels someone as a murderer.

- **Role of Function in Qualification**
  - Characters can indirectly qualify themselves based on their reactions or the situations they are placed in.
    - Example: A detective can trick a suspect into revealing their guilt, making the suspect qualify themselves.
  
- **Misinterpretations and Anachronisms**
  - Older texts may be misinterpreted based on modern values or beliefs.
    - Example: The biblical Eve has been misinterpreted as inferior or wicked based on chronological and moralistic biases.

**Key Idea:** Characters in literature are qualified through a mix of direct statements, actions, and the perceptions of others, but understanding and interpreting these qualifications require careful analysis, avoiding biases and modern impositions.

**Interpretation and Qualification of Characters in Biblical and Literary Texts**

- **Creation and Separation in Genesis**
  - *Separation in Creation:* The act of creation is described as separation (e.g., dark from light, water from earth).
  - *Androgynous Nature of Adam:* Adam is formed from the earth and is androgynous. "So God created man(kind) in his own image."
  - *Eve's Creation:* Derived from Adam's rib and her name relates to Yahweh, suggesting her procreative powers. She may be viewed as "more developed" but is not necessarily superior.

- **Misinterpretations of Eve's Actions**
  - *Eating the Fruit:* Instead of being driven by greed or lust, Eve seeks wisdom and embraces the human condition where birth counteracts death.
  - *Adam's Recognition:* Adam names Eve as "the mother of all living," acknowledging her significance.

- **Critique of Structural Analysis**
  - *Need for Critical Interpretation:* Interpretations can be misleading if not critiqued and may result in ideological manipulations.

- **Character Qualifications: Explicit vs. Implicit**
  - *Explicit Qualifications:* Direct information sources about characters, which can be reliable or not.
  - *Implicit Qualifications:* Derived from character actions. They can be potential (plans) or realized actions.
  - *Frequency of Qualification:* The more frequently and diversely a character is qualified, the more emphasis it receives.

- **Character Classification based on Emphasis**
  - *Basis of Classification:* Based on sources of information, frequency, and the type of qualification.
  - *Beyond Flat and Round:* A refined classification can be achieved, considering the degree of emphasis, that moves beyond the traditional "flat" and "round" character distinction.

**Key Idea:** The interpretation of characters in texts requires a critical analysis, distinguishing between explicit and implicit qualifications, to provide a nuanced understanding that avoids ideological biases and superficial classifications.

**Character Construction and Perception in Proust’s Works**

- **Proust's Albertine as a "Paper Person"**
  - *Beyond Realism:* Proust's character, Albertine, is best understood beyond the boundaries of traditional realism, showcasing modernist features with hints of postmodernism.
  - *Object of Obsession:* Albertine’s existence revolves around the protagonist's perceptions. Her demise in an unlikely accident occurs once she's served her narrative purpose.
  - *Psychological Depth:* Acknowledging Albertine’s lack of inherent psychological depth allows a greater appreciation for Proust’s character construction and narrative intentions.

- **Challenges in Realistic Reading**
  - *Misinterpretations:* Viewing Albertine as a "real girl" results in frustrations, with some even accusing Proust of creating an unsympathetic character and a selfish protagonist.

- **Albertine's Introduction and Perception**
  - *Initial Introduction:* Albertine is initially noted by Marcel from a distance, on a beach. The difficulty of pinpointing her identity and features reflects the challenge of truly knowing another individual.
  - *Role of Others:* Before the protagonist truly observes Albertine, others describe her, shaping his perceptions.
  - *Descriptive Challenges:* A prolonged passage in "Place-names: The Place" elaborates on the narrator's struggle to describe and distinguish Albertine amidst a group, highlighting the inherent subjectivity and arbitrariness of perception.

- **Temporal Dynamics in Perception**
  - *Temporal Struggles:* The narrator's observations are influenced by a combination of accelerated temporalities, including the unfolding events, the narrative discourse, and the reading experience.
  - *Transient Beauty:* The beauty of the observed group is ephemeral and in flux, marked by continuous transformation and the absence of clear demarcations.

**Key Idea:** Proust's construction of the character Albertine emphasizes the fluidity of perception, challenging traditional notions of realism in character depiction and highlighting the intricacies of subjective observation.

**Proust's Characterization and the Postmodern Lens**

- **Proust's Albertine**: 
  - Albertine is a significant character in Proust's work, serving as a representation of postmodernist traits in a modernist masterpiece.
  - Presented as a flat character without psychological depth, she acts based on the protagonist's perspective and interpretations.
  - Her existence in the narrative serves the themes of jealousy, love, and knowledge. Her sudden death emphasizes her utilitarian role in the story.

- **Character Perception and Reality**: 
  - The portrayal of characters is shaped by narratorial perceptions and not just objective reality.
  - The protagonist's first view of Albertine is non-specific and based on fleeting impressions and expectations. Distinct character traits are challenging to pin down, emphasizing the subjectivity of human perception.

- **Character Construction**:
  - Characters are built from a series of events and perceptions rather than a consistent, individualized identity.
  - Albertine's essence is fragmented, constructed from snapshots and moments rather than a holistic understanding.
  - The challenge of truly knowing another individual is central to Proust's narrative. Even after choosing Albertine as his love interest, the protagonist grapples with understanding her fully.

- **Ontological and Epistemological Themes**:
  - Proust delves into the nature of being and understanding, hinting at the postmodern shift from modernist perspectives.
  - The narrative emphasizes the elusiveness of true knowledge about another person, represented by Albertine's scattered and fragmented identity.
  - The series of snapshots characterizing Albertine underscores the impermanence and fluidity of her identity.

- **Fiction's Make-believe Nature**:
  - Fiction, while not strictly "real", can offer insights that feel truer than truth.
  - The portrayal of characters in literature, like Albertine, can provide profound insights even if they resist strict human characterization.

**Key Idea**: 
Proust’s portrayal of Albertine highlights the complexities of character perception and understanding, emphasizing themes of epistemological doubt and the transient nature of identity in a narrative that blurs the lines between modernist and postmodernist perspectives.
## 7: Space

**Summary: The Role of Space in Narrative Theory**

**1. Concept of Space:**
    - *Definition:* The notion of space in narrative theory is intricate and often ambiguous.
    - *Relation to Other Concepts:* Situated between focalization (special case of space representation) and place (a fabula element).
    - *Visual Aspect:* Central to the visualization in narratives, like how a film might depict a scene through a moving camera.
    - *Binding to Character:* Space's representation links characters with their environments, grounding them in a specific context.
    - *Naturalization vs. Theatricality:* Narratives dance on the line between making a world seem natural and turning it into an artificial spectacle. 

**2. Space Perception:**
    - *How Characters Perceive Space:* Characters employ senses like sight, hearing, and touch to interpret their environments.
    - *Sight:* Shapes, colors, sizes observed from unique perspectives.
    - *Hearing:* Sounds contribute to spatial context, indicating distance or proximity.
    - *Touch:* Reveals proximity and texture of objects.
    - *Two Relation Types:* The frame in which a character is situated and how that frame is populated or decorated.

**3. Inner vs. Outer Space:**
    - *Frames and Meanings:* Inner and outer spaces serve as frames that gain meaning based on their juxtaposition and cultural connotations.
    - *Symbolism:* The boundary that defines these frames often holds symbolic significance, influencing the story's tone or message.

**4. Spatial Configuration and Objects:**
    - *Object Influence:* Objects in a space shape its perception, with clutter making a room feel smaller and minimalism making it seem larger.
    - *Configuration:* The arrangement of these objects alters space perception.
    - *Detail Level:* Some narratives describe space explicitly, while others present it implicitly.

**Key Idea:** The narrative's utilization and description of space, both in terms of character perception and its broader symbolic function, plays a pivotal role in shaping the story's context, tone, and message.

**Summary: The Semantics and Function of Space in Narratives**

**1. Semantic Content of Spatial Aspects:**
   - *Construction Similarities:* Spatial aspects are semantically constructed similarly to a character.
   - *Elements Involved:* Determination, repetition, accumulation, transformation, and relations between spaces.
   - *Reader's Frame of Reference:* The understanding of a space, such as Dublin, varies based on the reader's familiarity. 

**2. Determination through General Characteristics:**
   - *Big City Example:* Every city shares some characteristics, but the specifics differ.
   - *General Characteristics' Role:* While specifics provide detail, general characteristics are foundational for imagining the space.

**3. Functions of Space in a Story:**
   - *Frames vs. Thematized Spaces:*
      - *Frames:* Spaces serving primarily as settings.
      - *Thematized Spaces:* Spaces central to the narrative, influencing events.
   - *Impact of "Here":* Emphasizes the importance of both the event occurring and its location.
   - *Steady vs. Dynamic Spaces:*
      - *Steady Space:* A constant backdrop for events.
      - *Dynamic Space:* Changes or adapts, often facilitating character movement.

**4. Influence of Movement on Space Perception:**
   - *Character Movement:* Movement, such as walking or traveling, shapes the perception of space.
   - *Speed and Vision:* Fast movement, like on a train, alters how one perceives space, making objects blur together.
   - *Sounds Altering Spaces:* A single sound, like a bird's chirp, can drastically change the perception of an environment.
   - *Narrative as a Journey:* A traveler in a story often represents the journey of the narrative itself.

**Key Idea:** Space in narratives serves both as a backdrop and an influential entity, with its perception and function deeply intertwined with characters' actions and readers' understanding.

**Summary: Character Movement and Spatial Dynamics in Literature**

**1. Strategic Movement between Spaces:**
   - *Opposition of Spaces:* Characters often move between contrasting spaces, like from negative to positive.
   - *Interim Transitions:* Space might just be an intermediary phase between a departure and an arrival.

**2. Purpose of Movement in Travel Stories:**
   - *Change and Growth:* Movement is expected to result in outcomes such as change, liberation, or wisdom.
   - *Gender-specific Narratives:* Historically, men travel in stories, while women remain stationary. This delineation has influenced the development of genres like epics and lyrics.

**3. Evolution of Literary Genres:**
   - *Epic vs. Novel:* While epic literature is tied to men, the novel, contrary to some beliefs, might have emerged as a women's genre.
   - *Postcolonial Dynamics:* Modern epics have shifted from celebrating conquests to resisting them and reclaiming spaces, transforming spaces into sites of memory.

**4. Presentation and Experience of Space:**
   - *Experiential Aim:* Without a purpose, movement can simply present a space without deeper meaning.
   - *Circular Movement:* Characters can return to their starting point, portraying spaces as confining or labyrinth-like.

**5. Novel "Migas de pan" and Spatial Themes:**
   - *Connection to Tom Thumb:* Both stories allude to characters trying to mark their path, but facing challenges that thwart their plans.
   - *Repetition and Tragedy:* The stories emphasize the tragic powerlessness of characters through repeated events, like Josué's repeated captures.

**Key Idea:** The movement of characters in literature often symbolizes deeper themes of change, identity, and struggle, and the space they traverse becomes symbolic of their internal and external journeys.

**Summary: The Relationship between Space, Words, and Memory in Literature**

**1. Story's Context:**
   - *Samuel's Role:* The main character, Samuel, is in charge after his father's abduction, primarily focusing on waiting and negotiating with the kidnapper.
   
**2. The House's Role in the Story:**
   - *The House as a Museum:* Various rooms in the house have been dedicated by the father, Josué, to specific themes or purposes.
   - *Theatre of Time:* A room highlighting the essence of time, illustrating the ongoing progression of life.
   - *Hospital for Words:* A unique concept where Josué visualizes words as entities requiring healing from damage caused by lies and violence.
   
**3. Josué’s Vision:**
   - *Poetological Reflection:* The novel portrays Josué’s vision of cleaning and rejuvenating words to reverse the damage inflicted upon them.
   - *Preserving the Past:* Josué emphasizes placing the past in front to understand and heal it, signifying the importance of history and introspection.
   
**4. Relation between Objects and Words:**
   - *Room of Gold:* Objects, akin to words, require rejuvenation and are associated with specific words, highlighting their interconnectedness.
   - *Conversations Among Objects:* Josué believes objects, like ashes, have stories and conversations to share.
   
**5. The Theatre of Memory:**
   - *Stories of Campmates:* Josué created a space to remember and recount tales of campmates, emphasizing the importance of memory.
   - *Contrasting Spaces:* Josué compares his gallery to the "Palace of the Inquisition," a place that tries to forget past horrors, while his space aims to remember and learn.
   - *Significance of “Memoratro”:* The term underlines the importance of creating a space to activate dormant words and memories.

**Key Idea:** The novel intricately weaves space, words, and memories to emphasize the importance of preserving the past, rejuvenating abused words, and understanding the intertwined relationship between objects and narratives.
## 8: Focalization

**Summary: Understanding the Concept of Focalization in Storytelling**

**1. Nature of Storytelling:**
   - *Subjectivity in Presentation:* Events in storytelling always come from a unique perspective, indicating its subjective essence.
   - *Narrative Responsibility:* Denying this inherent subjectivity might be seen as evading responsibility for the narrative.
   
**2. Objectivity in Storytelling:**
   - *Aim for Objectivity:* Striving to present only what's perceived, avoiding comments and implicit interpretation.
   - *Perception as a Variable:* Perception varies depending on multiple factors, making true objectivity challenging.
       - *Factors Influencing Perception:* Physical position, light angle, distance, prior knowledge, and psychological attitudes can all alter one's perception.
   
**3. Storytelling as Transmission:**
   - *Passing on Perceptions:* Storytelling is a method of sharing one's perception or interpretation of events.
   
**4. Role of Focalization:**
   - *Definition:* Focalization refers to the relationship between the viewer's perspective and what is viewed or perceived.
   - *Significance in Storytelling:* It determines how elements of the fabula (plot elements) are portrayed and understood through the lens of the narrative.

![[Pasted image 20231003120848.png]]

**Key Idea:** Focalization, a central concept in storytelling, highlights the inherent subjectivity in presenting events, emphasizing the intricate relationship between perception and portrayal.

**Summary: Focalization and Its Significance in Visual Narratives**

**1. The Intricacies of Arjuna's Penance:**
   - *Bas-relief Overview:* Located in Mahaballipuram, this seventh-century depiction contains various seemingly unrelated figures such as Arjuna, a cat, and laughing mice.
   - *Interpreting the Scene:*
       - Arjuna meditates, seeking Lord Siva's favor.
       - Inspired by Arjuna, the cat emulates the meditation pose.
       - Recognizing the cat's atypical behavior, the mice find safety and laugh.
   - *Narrative Significance:* The scene's parts collectively form a coherent story with causal relationships, defining a fabula.
   - *Semiotic Activities:* The comical effect arises from recognizing and interpreting the visual signs, such as the unlikely meditating cat.

**2. Perception and Sequentiality:**
   - *Chain of Observations:* Arjuna's absorption, the cat's emulation, and the mice's realization all occur sequentially.
   - *Perceptual Identification:* Viewers relate to the mice's perception and the incongruity of a meditating cat, leading to the humorous effect.
   - *Alternative Interpretation:* The cat might feign its meditation, adding an element of suspense and underlining the mice's laughter at the supposed imitation.

**3. Role of Focalization:**
   - *Visual Signs:* Spatial relations among the bas-relief elements serve as visual cues.
   - *Formation of Fabula:* The relationships between visual cues and their implied actions/events (fabula) rely on a mediating vision or focalization.
   - *Layered Focalizations:* The spectator's perception encompasses various layers of observed actions, from Arjuna to the mice, each representing focalization.
   - *Action vs. Perception:* Verbs indicating actions present events, while verbs of perception highlight focalization processes.

**Key Idea:** Focalization underscores the dynamic interplay between visual cues and viewer interpretation, forming layers of perceptions and shaping narratives in visual storytelling.

**Summary: The Dynamics of Focalization in Narrative**

**1. Nature of Focalization:**
   - *Definition:* Focalization is the interplay between the viewing agent and the viewed subject within a narrative.
   - *Position in Narrative:* Sits in the story layer, bridging the linguistic text and the fabula, making it integral to narrative content.
   - *Importance of Relationship:* To understand focalization, both poles - the subject (focalizer) and the object of focus - must be analyzed.

**2. The Focalizer's Role:**
   - *Point of View:* The focalizer offers the perspective from which events are viewed.
   - *Internal vs. External:* The focalizing point can be within a character (part of the fabula) or external to characters.
   - *Character-bound Focalization (CF):*
       - A CF often privileges a character's viewpoint over others.
       - Readers see through this character's eyes, potentially causing bias.
       - E.g., "What Maisie Knew" by Henry James uses Maisie's limited understanding, contrasting her childlike perspective with the reader's adult interpretation.

**3. Narrative Implications of Focalization:**
   - *Effect on Reader:* The disparity between a character's perception and the reader's interpretation can shape a narrative's overall impact.
   - *Narrator vs. Focalizer:* A distinction exists between the one narrating and the one focalizing, with the former not always sharing the latter's perspective.
   - *Variable CF:* Focalization can transition between characters, revealing differing viewpoints on the same events and potentially establishing neutrality.

**Key Idea:** Focalization, as a narrative tool, not only directs the viewer's perspective but also deeply influences the reader's interpretation, understanding, and emotional engagement with a story.

**Summary: Exploration of Focalization in Literary Narratives**

**1. Character's Experience of Stereotypes:**
   - *Testing Ideas:* The character assesses ideas as one would try on different dresses.
   - *Cliched Sentiments:* Common phrases and beliefs about love, growth, marriage, and age are echoed by the character.
   
**2. Shift in Focalization:**
   - *External to Internal:* Initially, an external focalizer (EF) is used, which then shifts to an internal, character-focused one (CF).
   - *Alternation in Stories:* Many narratives alternate between EF and CF, offering varied perspectives.
   
**3. Multiple Character Focalizers:**
   - *Variety of Perspectives:* Several characters might act as focalizers in a story.
   - *Focalization Load:* Some characters might carry more of the focalization weight than others, while some might not focalize at all.
   
**4. Exclusively External Focalization:**
   - *Objective Appearance:* When only an EF is used, a narrative might seem unbiased.
   - *Implicit Bias:* No storytelling is genuinely objective; even with EF, biases exist but remain unspoken.

**Key Idea:** Focalization in narratives can shift and alternate between external and internal perspectives, offering varied lenses through which the story unfolds and influencing the reader's engagement and understanding.

**Summary: Analysis of Focalization in Descriptive Literary Narratives**

**1. Focalized Objects and Relationships:**
   - *Harold & Indies:* Harold often serves as the focalizer when events in the Indies are depicted.
   - *Lot & Mama Ottilie:* Lot's focalization of Mama Ottilie paints a likeable image despite her disagreeable actions.
   - *Impact:* The focalizer can shape perceptions of the focalized object, and vice versa.
   
**2. Questions Regarding Focalization:**
   - *Target of Focalization:* What is the focalizer focusing on?
   - *Attitude:* How does the focalizer view its subject?
   - *Identity:* Who is the focalizer? What is the focalized object?
   
**3. Elements of Focalization:**
   - *Objects & Events:* Both can be focalized by either EF (external focalizer) or CF (character-focused).
   - *Interpretation:* Focalization offers a non-neutral, interpretative perspective on these elements.

**4. Comparison of Descriptive Passages:**
   - *Passage c – Temple & Landscape:* The narrative from "Of Old People" offers a detailed view, blending realism and interpretative imagery. Expressions highlight spatial perspective and proximity, and metaphors humanize the scenery.
   - *Passage d – Angel Imagery:* The description provides a fantastical, personal interpretation, challenging traditional imagery and employing humour.

**5. Interpretative Nature of Focalization:**
   - *Incorporation of Reality & Perception:* While presenting a realistic view, focalization can simultaneously interpret subjects to fit a character's perspective.
   - *Contrast & Humour:* Narrative humour can either include or exclude readers, based on their comfort with the subject matter.

**Key Idea:** Focalization in narratives not only provides a lens to view events or subjects but also shapes and interprets them, bridging the gap between realism and personal perception.

**Interpretative Focalization in Story Narration**

- **Introduction to Focalization**:
  - The focalizer's interpretation is paramount in determining how an object or idea is presented.
  - This focalization provides deeper insights into the focalizer rather than the objects described.
  - A presented object can convey information about both the object itself and the focalizer's perception.

- **Types of Focalization**:
  - **Perceptible Objects**:
    - These are objects that the focalizer can physically perceive.
    - Example given where CF (“I”) sees an object outside of itself.
  - **Non-perceptible Objects**:
    - These objects are only visible within a character’s internal world (mind, feelings, dreams).
    - They can't be perceived by other characters in the narrative.
    - Example provided is the content of a character’s dream.

- **Contextual Role of Focalization**:
  - The meaning of an object, whether perceptible or non-perceptible, often depends on the narrative context.
  - In the given example, the perception of heaven can change based on its context in the story.

- **Focalization Notation**:
  - A system to represent the type of focalization - using "p" for perceptible and "np" for non-perceptible.

- **Power Dynamics through Focalization**:
  - Focalization can highlight power imbalances between characters.
  - If one character has both CF–p and CF–np focalizations, they have a narrative advantage.
  - This character can provide the reader with deeper insights into their internal world.

- **Manipulation through Focalization**:
  - Focalization can be a manipulative narrative device.
  - Example: In Colette’s "The Cat", focalization manipulates readers to side with one character over another.
  - Distinction made between characters' spoken (audible) and unspoken (thoughts, feelings) words.
  - Readers might not always discern what is known to them vs. what is known to other characters.

**Key Idea**: Focalization in narration, whether based on perceptible or non-perceptible objects, offers deep insights into characters, can dictate power dynamics, and has the potential to manipulate reader perceptions.

**Understanding Levels of Focalization in Narratives**

- **Concept of Focalization**:
  - It refers to the lens or perspective through which events in a story are perceived.
  - Various focalization levels can be distinguished in narratives.
  
- **Examples and Analysis**:
  - **Simple Focalization**:
    - *Example*: Mary participates in the rally.
      - This doesn't indicate who perceives the event. An external focalizer (EF) outside the story or a character focalizer (CF) might be implied.
  - **Complex Focalization**:
    - *Examples*:
      - I saw that Mary participated in the rally.
      - Michele saw that Mary participated in the rally.
    - Both involve a secondary layer of focalization. Who sees the event (the "I" or Michele) becomes as important as the event itself.
    - The verb "saw" indicates the shift in focalization.
  
- **Comparative Understanding**:
  - In first-person narratives, an external focalizer (often an older "I") gives its perspective of a past event in which it participated. At times, it can present its younger self's perspective.
  - There's no fundamental difference in focalization between first-person and third-person narratives.
  - The external focalizer always maintains the primary focalization, with the character focalizer's perspective embedded within.
  
- **Levels of Focalization**:
  - **F1**: First level where the focalizer is external.
  - **F2**: This level involves an internal focalizer which perceives events within the story.
  - Shifts in focalization levels can be marked with verbs indicating perception, such as "see" or "hear".
  
- **Ambiguous Focalization**:
  - Sometimes it's unclear whose perspective is being presented.
  - Example from Chekhov’s story “Lady with Lapdog”: Description of the lady is ambiguously focalized by both an external focalizer and the character Dmitri.
  - Such focalization can be indicated as EF1/CF2, representing the ambiguity between external and character focalizers.
  
- **Key Idea**: Focalization in narratives offers a layered and complex perspective of events, where the observer's perception can be as crucial as the event itself. Whether through simple, complex, or ambiguous lenses, focalization shapes the reader's understanding of the narrative.

**Memory as a Form of Focalization in Narratives**

- **Definition and Characteristics of Memory**:
  - Memory acts as a "vision" of the past situated in the present moment.
  - Often manifests as a narrative, where loose elements coalesce into a coherent story.
  - The recounted memory may differ from the actual experienced event, especially in cases of trauma.

- **Reliability and Rhetoric of Memory**:
  - Memories can be unreliable and might differ from the original event (fabula).
  - When articulated, memories are crafted to resonate with an audience.
  
- **Trauma and Memory**:
  - Traumatic events disrupt comprehension and can't be "worked through" traditionally.
  - Recur in fragments, nightmares, and are difficult to process.
  - The aftermath affects both the story and text layers.

- **Memory's Connection to Time and Space**:
  - Memory ties together time and space, especially in post-colonial contexts.
  - Retroversion, or looking back, acts as a counter to colonizing focalization, termed as "mapping."
  - Focalization that disregards time eliminates the essence of lived experience.

- **Spatializing Memory and Historical Context**:
  - Patrick Chamoiseau's "Texaco" emphasizes the significance of preserving spaces with memory.
  - Urban planning decisions can amputate a city from its future and memory richness.
  - Contrasting monumental structures with spaces that "irradiate" or emanate their essence.

- **Narrative Complexity and Reader's Perspective**:
  - The interpretation of space in stories can be historically significant and politically charged.
  - Narratives are dependent on the reader's ability to discern whose perspective or vision they are viewing.
  - Differentiating focalization levels enhances the literary experience of narratives.

**Key Idea**: 
Memory serves as a critical form of focalization in narratives, bridging time and space, and allowing readers to navigate between individual and collective experiences, enriching their comprehension of the narrative's depth and intricacies.

**Lalka (The Doll) by Boleslaw Prus: Emotional Capitalism and Society's Inertia**

- **Comparison with Madame Bovary**:
  - Both novels explore the mix of emotional and commercial interests termed "emotional capitalism".
  - Difference in gender dynamics with the man, Stanislaw Wokulski, as the emotionally distressed party.

- **Main Characters and Their Dynamics**:
  - Stanislaw Wokulski: A successful businessman, passionate and obsessed with Izabela.
  - Izabela: An impoverished noblewoman seeking marriage with wealth and status.
  - Their relationship spans across 700 pages, with Stanislaw's infatuation and Izabela's pursuit of societal elevation.

- **Societal Reflections**:
  - Surrounding characters are quick to use ethnic, class, and gender stereotypes.
  - Society views women as weak and unstable.
  - Recognizable scenes from renowned authors like Balzac and Dickens are echoed.

- **Shifts in Focalization**:
  - Wokulski stands out in society but is equally influenced by its views.
  - Example: His reflection on the old Baron's engagement story, showing a shift from present to retrospective focalization.

- **Paris Adventures and Emotional Turmoil**:
  - Wokulski travels to Paris, hoping to escape thoughts of Izabela.
  - Experiences a range of emotions, from marveling at inventions to feeling tormented by his unrequited love.
  - His emotional instability contrasts with the societal and scientific wonders around him.

- **Overall Theme of the Novel**:
  - The narrative portrays a man torn between heart and intellect in a society that clings to outdated norms.

**Key Idea**: 
Lalka delves into the emotional turmoil of an individual trapped within societal expectations, painting a vivid picture of a man's internal conflict amidst a backdrop of societal rigidity and inertia.

**Suspense and Focalization: Analyzing Narrative Rhetoric**

- **Definition of Suspense**:
  - Described as an effect where the reader or character poses questions that are answered later.
  - Essential for suspense: repeated recall of questions with postponed answers.

- **Relation to Order**:
  - Suspense can arise from announcing future events or withholding necessary information.
  - The reader's image is manipulated, with the focalizer presenting that image.

- **Role of the Focalizer**:
  - Acts akin to a camera, presenting the image to the reader.
  - Can have limitations, where characters are privy to more information.
  - Focalizer can also omit details, misleading the reader.
  - Sometimes, the focalizer knows more than the characters, providing the reader with a more comprehensive picture.

- **Suspense and Knowledge Dynamics**:
  1. **Neither Reader Nor Character Knows**: 
     - E.g., the beginning of many detective novels.
  2. **Reader Knows, Character Doesn't**:
     - Tension arises from wondering if the character will realize the truth in time.
     - E.g., a character is in danger but unaware.
  3. **Character Knows, Reader Doesn't**:
     - Information can be revealed gradually using different focalizers.
     - E.g., in stories with secrets or puzzles.
  4. **Both Reader and Character Know**:
     - This situation lacks suspense.

- **Forms of Suspense**:
  - Each type can be further dissected to determine the character's knowledge and the focalization channel informing the reader.

**Key Idea**: 
Suspense in narratives hinges on the balance of information between the reader and characters, with the focalizer playing a pivotal role in manipulating and presenting this information.

**Summary: Theory of the Novel and Focalization**

- **Traditional "Theory of the Novel" Concerns:**
  - *Deceptiveness:* The term is misleading as the novel is a highly researched textual form, often contrasted with other genres like drama, poetry, and short stories. Using it can blur distinctions.
  - *No Unified System:* Various research areas, such as temporal relationships or "point of view" theories, sometimes appear disjointed, lacking a single unified theory.
  - *Systematic Theoretical Framework Attempt:* Genette's "Discours du recit" tried to systematically bring together different narratological distinctions. This, however, wasn't without challenges due to the differences in origins of the various aspects.

- **Focalization and its Importance:**
  - *Central Role:* It determines how different elements and aspects function. It's essential for understanding the significance of certain aspects.
  - *Manipulative Power:* Considered a subtle means of manipulation, especially in revealing hidden ideologies in reports.
  - *Connection with Other Works:* Much of the chapter aligns with Herman's cognitive narratology and other works. However, certain distinctions or approaches, like the psychological take on narratology, were found less relevant.

- **Narrative's Relationship with Reality:**
  - *Representation vs. Tool for Critique:* Instead of seeing narratives as mere representations of reality, they should be viewed as tools for critical analysis.
  - *Concept of Makebelieve:* Refers to Kendall L. Walton's perspective on fictionality.

- **Narrative Aspects & Further Development:**
  - *Theory of Anachrony:* Since its initial study by Lämmert in 1955, this has seen further development, with Genette's work being notable.
  - *Character Analysis:* Hamon's 1983 article is significant, though certain distinctions, like that between signifier and signified, are contested.
  - *Narrative Space:* Difference between place (location) and space (setting) has been discussed, with references to works like that of Michel de Certeau and Lefebvre.
  - *Narrative Points of View:* Friedman and Booth provided insights, though they were not always systematic.
  - *Introduction of Focalization:* Initially introduced by Genette in 1972, with subsequent discussions and studies adding to the subject.

- **Narrative Memory and Trauma:**
  - *Relation:* Studies like Van Alphen's on memory and trauma link to narrative incapacitation.
  - *Term "Postmemory":* Introduced by Marianne Hirsch, this term has both benefits and potential for misunderstandings.

**Key Idea:** 
The "Theory of the Novel" is a complex field with various interconnected aspects, with focalization being a central and influential component in understanding narratives, their relation to reality, and their deeper implications.

# 3 Fabula: Elements 

## 1: Preliminary Remarks

**Narrative Fabula Construction and Its Implication for Reality**

- **Preliminary Remarks**:
  - Fabulas in narrative texts often mirror sentence structures and real-life events.
  - This construction based on the human logic of events can be applied not only to literature but also to films, theater, news reports, and real-world scenarios.
  
- **Composition of Fabulas**:
  - Fabulas consist of two main elements:
    - **Stable Elements**: These refer to objects which include actors, locations, and things. 
    - **Changeable Elements (Processes)**: These are the events or changes that occur in relation to the objects.
  - The combination of both stable and changeable elements is crucial for creating a comprehensive fabula.

- **Structuralist Approach**:
  - This chapter adopts a structuralist perspective to understand and interpret the construction of fabulas.

**Key Idea**: The structure of fabulas in narrative texts offers a reflection of real-life events and human logic, bridging literature and reality through a combination of stable and changeable elements.

## 2. Events

**Analysis of Events in Fabula Construction**

- **Definition of Events**:
  - Events are transitions between states, driven or experienced by actors.
  - They signify a process or alteration in state.

- **Differentiating Processes from Conditions**:
  - A process indicates a change, whereas a condition describes a static state.
    - Example: "John is ill" (condition) vs. "John falls ill" (process).
  - Context matters; "John was cleaning his house. John is ill." suggests interruption, even if not explicit.

- **Importance of Linguistic Form**:
  - The verb in a sentence can hint at an event, but isn't always conclusive.
  - It's incorrect to assume that every event is indicated by an action verb.
    - Rewording can make implicit relationships explicit (e.g., "John stopped cleaning").

- **Functional vs. Non-functional Events**:
  - Roland Barthes distinguished between these two event types.
  - Functional events:
    - Offer a choice between possibilities.
    - Realize or reveal the outcome of a choice.
    - Influence the fabula's course.
    - Example: Liz choosing a route that leads to her being on time for an important work event.
  - Non-functional events may be significant for character development but not for the overall story progression.

- **Contextual Importance**:
  - Some events, even if seemingly significant, might not be "functional" if they don't connect with the rest of the fabula.
  - The relevance of an event depends on its impact on the narrative and not just its inherent drama or consequence.
    - For instance, a traffic accident might not be a functional event if it just showcases rush hour traffic.

**Key Idea**: The identification and importance of events in a fabula depend on their functionality and influence on the narrative's progression, rather than just their overt drama or action.

**Understanding Event Selection and Analysis in Fabula Structure**

- **Definition of Events**
  - Events are transitions from one state to another, experienced by actors.
  - An event is a process, signifying an alteration.

- **Criteria for Event Analysis**
  - **Change**
    - Events often signify a change in the narrative.
    - Difference between static conditions (e.g., "John is ill") and dynamic changes (e.g., "John falls ill").
  - **Choice**
    - Distinction between functional and non-functional events based on Roland Barthes.
    - Functional events result in a choice that impacts the fabula's development (e.g., route selection in a journey).
  - **Confrontation**
    - Every functional event has two actors/groups and an action.
    - The linguistic structure often contains two nominal components and one verbal component (subject-predicate-object).
    - The direct object should also be an actor for the confrontation to hold significance.

- **Understanding Relationships**
  - Fabulas are series of events that have logical and chronological connections.
  - The goal is to map concrete events onto an abstract model, like Bremond's, to reveal specific structures.
  - Such models should consider both logical rules (cause and effect) and conventional restrictions (cultural norms and textual genres).
  
- **Conventional Restrictions**
  - Rules and norms specific to certain historical periods or cultures.
  - Texts from different eras or cultures might break or uphold different conventions, affecting the reading experience.
  
- **Bremond’s Model**
  - An abstract model that represents a broad range of events.
  - It reveals relationships among events, making their connections more transparent.

**Key Idea**: The fabula's structure is determined by the selection and analysis of events based on change, choice, and confrontation criteria, with each event's significance dependent on its relational context and the broader narrative framework.

**Summary: The Narrative Cycle and Fabula Structure in Literary Events**

- **Understanding of Fabula**:
  - The fabula is seen as a series of events that make up a process.
  - Every event can be considered a process or part of one.
  
- **Three Phases of a Fabula**:
  - **Possibility/Virtuality**: This indicates the potential for an event.
    - E.g. Liz wanting to earn a diploma.
  - **Event/Realization**: The actual happening or the execution of the possibility.
    - E.g. Liz preparing for her exam.
  - **Result/Conclusion**: The outcome or finality of the process.
    - E.g. Liz passing or failing the exam.
  - Note: All three phases aren't always essential.

- **Elementary and Complex Series**:
  - **Elementary Series**: Basic series of events.
    - E.g. John's desire to offer dinner and the outcomes related to it.
  - **Complex Series**: The combination of elementary series.
    - Events can follow one another, with the conclusion of one being the beginning of another.
    - Events can also be embedded within another event.
    - E.g. John's tiredness leading to him falling asleep and subsequently forgetting about his exam.

- **Embedded and Primary Series**:
  - An embedded series specifies or elaborates on the primary series.
  - The relationship between the two series might be causal or merely descriptive.
    - E.g. Peter's insult leads to John's anger, which further evolves based on Peter's explanation.

- **Human Interest in Narratives**:
  - Many narratives captivate readers because of some form of human interest.
  - Narratives can show processes of improvement or deterioration.
    - These processes can be embedded within each other or succeed each other.

- **Semantic Labels and Interpretation**:
  - Events in fabulas can be labeled semantically for easy comparison.
  - Examples include fulfillment of a task, elimination of an opponent, satisfaction, etc.
  - These labels can be further specified and broken down into more concrete events.
    - E.g. Satisfaction can be punishment, revenge, or reward.

- **Starting Point of a Fabula**:
  - Typically begins with a state of deficiency, with characters aiming to induce changes.
  - The narrative unfolds, showing improvements or deteriorations concerning the initial situation.

![[Pasted image 20231003122122.png]]

**Key Idea**: The narrative cycle and fabula structure offer a framework for understanding the sequences and patterns in literary events, with human interest often driving the reader's engagement.

**Principles of Structuring Narrative Events**

- **Selection and Relation of Events**: 
  - Events can be connected in diverse ways.
  - Bremond’s model provides a foundational approach, but its use depends on its relevance to the particular fabula.
  - Structures arise based on the investigator's chosen events combined with other details. The relevance between selected data and their application should be clear.
  
- **Grouping by Actor Identity**:
  - Events can be organized based on the main actor involved, thereby segmenting the fabula into phases.
  - It’s possible to contrast events involving two main actors versus events with only one primary actor and a secondary actor.
  
- **Nature of Confrontation**:
  - Classification can be based on the type of confrontation: verbal, mental, or physical.
  - The outcome of these confrontations (success, failure, or undetermined) can hint at themes, e.g., prevalent mental and unsuccessful contacts suggest a theme of alienation.
  
- **Temporal Organization**:
  - Events can be juxtaposed against time, with some occurring simultaneously and others in succession.
  - Series of linked events can be punctuated by periods where no significant narrated events occur.
  
- **Spatial Classification**:
  - Event locations can contribute to narrative structure.
  - Potential oppositions include inside vs. outside, above vs. below, city vs. country, etc.
  
- **Combination of Factors**:
  - Multiple criteria can be combined for richer analysis, such as actor A always being indoors and actor S outdoors.
  - Different actors might prefer different types of contact, adding layers of complexity to the narrative structure.
  
- **Advantage of Explicit Analysis**:
  - Making intuitive choices clear through analysis allows investigators to align their personal interests with a universally comprehensible model, ensuring both subjectivity and transparency.

**Key Idea**: Narrative structures in literature arise from various classifications like actor involvement, nature of confrontations, temporal arrangements, and spatial locations, enabling analysts to derive meaningful patterns and themes.

## 3. Actors

**Defining and Classifying Actors in Narratives**

- **Definition of Actors**:
  - Actors play crucial roles in events and sequences.
  - They can cause or undergo sequences of events.
  
- **Selection of Actors**:
  - It's vital to discern which actors are functionally significant and which are not.
  - Non-functional actors, like porters or maids in 19th-century novels, might not play functional roles but can still have symbolic or cultural significance.
  
- **Classes of Actors**:
  - Structuralists, like Greimas, believe human action is directed towards an aim.
  - The relationship between fiction, reality, and truth can be reflected upon using models like Greimas'.
  - In such models, "actants" are classes of actors with shared characteristics related to the overall aim of the fabula.
  - The relationship between these actants, called the function, is vital.
  
- **Subject and Object Relations**:
  - The primary relation is between an actor (subject) pursuing a goal (object).
  - Examples: John wants to marry Mary; Anna Wulf wants independence; Kinsey Millhone seeks a murderer's identity.
  - Objects of intention can vary from riches, power, love, or societal change.
  
- **Diverse Text Examples**:
  - The given examples span various text types: epistolary novels, feminist narratives, detective stories, philosophical works, fairy tales, and folk literature.
  - These show the versatility of the subject-object relationship across diverse fabulas.

**Key Idea**: In narratives, actors play pivotal roles in shaping events. Their classification, based on intention and goals, forms the backbone of many stories, highlighting the universal interplay between subjects and objects.

**Analysis of Actor-Actant Relations in Fabulas**

- **Definition of Actors and Their Role in Fabulas**
  - Actors are essential elements in event sequences within a fabula.
  - The functional significance of an actor determines its inclusion in the analysis.
  - Non-functional actors, like porters in 19th-century novels, may be left out but can still have symbolic significance.

- **Role of Actants in Structural Analysis**
  - Structuralists propose models emphasizing actors' intentions, drawing from the idea that humans act with a goal in mind.
  - Actants are categories of actors sharing a specific quality related to the fabula's teleology.
    - Actants reflect the structural relationships within the narrative.
  
- **Subject and Object Dynamics**
  - Central to the analysis is the relationship between the subject (actor with an intention) and the object (aim or goal).
  - Numerous narrative examples, from fairy tales to detective novels, underscore this fundamental structure.

- **Introduction of Power and Receiver**
  - The subject's intention alone doesn't ensure achievement. External powers either facilitate or hinder these aims.
  - Powers can be abstract or personified entities.
  - The receiver, often the subject itself, is the one who ultimately benefits from the attained object.

- **Interplay of Actants and Actors**
  - Fabulas necessitate the presence of actants for structure, but the number of actors can vary.
  - Sometimes multiple actants might merge into a single actor or vice-versa.
  - In conventional love stories, for example, the male is both the subject and receiver, while the female serves as both the object and power.

- **Examples Illustrating Actant Relationships**
  - A variety of examples, from love stories to detective mysteries, showcase the relationship between subjects, objects, powers, and receivers in diverse narrative structures.

**Key Idea:** The analysis delves deep into the roles and interrelationships of actors and actants in fabulas, emphasizing the structural importance of subjects, objects, powers, and receivers in crafting narrative meaning.

**Distinction Between Helpers and Opponents in Fabula Structure**

- **Fundamental Role in Fabula Development**
  - Basic fabula: A subject desires something and may or may not get it.
  - Complexity arises when subjects encounter resistance or receive aid, introducing helpers and opponents.

- **Positioning within the Structure**
  - Helpers and opponents serve as "adverbial adjuncts," differing from direct object-related actants.
  - They influence the circumstances affecting the main subject-object relation.

- **Distinguishing Characteristics of Power and Helper**
  - **Power vs. Helper**
    - Power governs the entire endeavor; helper offers occasional assistance.
    - Power can be abstract, while a helper is usually tangible.
    - Power might remain unseen, but helpers frequently emerge prominently.
    - There's typically a singular power, whereas helpers can be multiple.

- **Distinguishing Characteristics of Negative Power and Opponent**
  - Negative power prevents the subject from achieving the objective; an opponent offers direct resistance.

- **Actant-Reader Relationship Complexities**
  - The relationships between actants don’t necessarily mirror actant-reader dynamics.
  - A helper in the narrative isn't always viewed favorably by readers; it depends on the subject's portrayal.
  - Recognizing the divergence between actant roles and reader responses is crucial for narrative analysis.

- **Examples Demonstrating Helper and Opponent Dynamics**
  - In a romance, factors like societal expectations or family disapproval might be opponents, whereas personal determination or supportive figures serve as helpers.
  - In detective stories, evidence or witnesses could act as helpers, while misinformation or elusive suspects are opponents.
  - Every narrative element, whether it aids or hinders the main subject’s goal, contributes to the overall structure and suspense of the fabula.

**Key Idea:** Helpers and opponents in fabulas are crucial in determining the narrative's trajectory, influencing the subject's journey towards or away from their goals, and contributing to the depth and suspense of the story.

**Actantial Roles in Literary Structures**

- **Actantial Model**
  - The model represents relations between phenomena, not just the phenomena.
  - The relationship between subject and object propels the fabula. 
  - Subject-object relation can be external (objective) or within oneself (subjective).
  
- **Duality in Subjects**
  - Some fabulas have a subject and an anti-subject.
    - Anti-subjects have their own objectives, sometimes clashing with the main subject.
  - Other narratives can have independent subjects with separate sub-fabulas.
    - Their actions may occasionally intersect or align with the main subject.
  
- **Differentiation of Power**
  - Power can sometimes merge with the subject, particularly when a character trait dominates the narrative.
  - There can be both positive and negative actants of power in a narrative.
    - This is evident in naturalistic novels where personal will conflicts with societal norms or heredity.
  
- **Competence in Subjects**
  - Competence relates to a subject's ability to execute their aim.
  - Greimas divides competence into:
    - Determination or will
    - Power or possibility
    - Knowledge or skill
  - Competence differentiation in fairy tales:
    - E.g., Giants possess the power, while characters like Tom Thumb have knowledge and skill.
  
- **Good vs. Evil and Competence**
  - The divide often exists in fairy tales.
    - E.g., The giant in the Tom Thumb story has power, while Tom has skill and knowledge.
  - In detective stories, both the detective and the criminal often possess knowledge and skill. 
    - The differentiation comes from mistakes the criminal makes, allowing the detective to solve the case.

**Key Idea:** The actantial model in literature dissects the relationships and competencies of characters, providing insight into their roles, powers, and the dynamics that shape the narrative.

**Actantial Analysis and Truth Value in Literary Research**

- **Truth Value & Actants Specification**:
    - Defines the reality of actants in the actantial structure.
    - Important for subjects, helpers, and opponents.
    - Actants may not always be as they appear.
        - E.g., A traitor may seem like a helper but turn out to be an opponent.
    - Categories of actors like liars, master figures, false heroes, invisible fairies, seducers, truth-tellers, and more play into this specification.

- **Actors & Fabula-Internal Truth**:
    - "Truth" lies in the consistency between an actor's existence and appearance.
    - If an actor truly is as they appear, they are considered true.
    - If they hide their identity, it's a secret.
    - If they seem to be something they're not, it's a lie.
    - Both actants and actantial schemes can be labeled as "true" or "false".
    - Examples include subjects aiming for an illusory goal or structures where a lie or a secret dominates the narrative.

- **Literary Genres & Actantial Structures**:
    - Different genres emphasize different actantial principles.
    - E.g., Detective stories hinge on secrets, while spy novels prioritize lies.
    - Analyzing these structures can help establish literary typologies, definitions, and contrasts.

- **Fabula Elements & Other Classifications**:
    - Works of literature are often about human relationships.
    - Relations can be psychological, ideological, or both.
    - Psychological relations are crucial in psychologically or psychoanalytically oriented criticism.
        - E.g., Relations such as father-son, daughter-mother.
        - There's a theory on tragedy focusing on the son's guilt towards the father and comedy focusing on the father's guilt towards the son.
    - Ideological relations highlight oppositions present in a narrative.
        - E.g., Opposition between feudalism and liberalism, patriarchy and feminism, and more.
    - Different oppositions, whether psychological, ideological, or other, provide a backbone to a narrative's actantial structure.

- **Role of Time in Fabula Analysis**:
    - Not explicitly detailed in the provided text but mentioned as a potential further area of exploration.

**Key Idea**: The truth value in actantial analysis is crucial for understanding the reality and roles of actants in literary works, with the narrative structures often built on the interplay of truth, secrets, and lies.
## 4. Time

**Chronology and Time in Narrative Forms**

- **Definition and Importance of Time Events**
  - Time Events are understood as processes.
  - A process implies change and succession in time.
  - Events take place during a specific duration and in a particular order.

- **Examples of Duration in Narratives**
  - “Tom Thumb” spans roughly three days, from the family's despair to their return to prosperity.
  - “Little Red Riding Hood” takes place in half a day.
  - Arabian Nights' main narrative unfolds over a season, while War and Peace spans years.
  - The Old Testament extends over centuries, while some detective narratives conclude in days.

- **Time Span in Fabula and Its Significance**
  - Time span can dictate the nature of the narrative.
  - Two main distinctions in time span:
    1. **Crisis**: Events compressed into a short duration.
    2. **Development**: Events spread over a more extended period.
  - There's no inherent superiority of one form over the other; preference is subjective.

- **Crisis vs. Development in Narratives**
  - Certain types of narratives, like autobiographies, war novels, and frame narratives, usually require a longer time span.
  - Crisis form is often seen in modern novels, where a pivotal moment dictates the course of the narrative.
  - The distinction is relative and can often coexist within a single narrative.

- **Implications of Choosing a Form**
  - **Development**:
    - Presents material in historical order.
    - Tends to be more extensive in detail.
    - Requires selection; not every moment is captured.
  - **Crisis**:
    - Focuses on limited yet critical moments.
    - Represents a single defining instance.
    - Requires asides to provide context or depth, e.g., recollections or references.

- **Extensions and Compressions in Narratives**
  - Both forms (crisis and development) can be extended or compressed.
  - Asides, sub-fabulas, and recollections can expand the scope of a crisis narrative.
  - For development, parts can be summarized or skipped for brevity.

- **Chronology's Role**
  - The sequence in which events are presented is vital for the reader's comprehension and the narrative's flow.

**Key Idea**: Time, whether presented as a crisis or a development, plays a pivotal role in shaping narratives, offering different perspectives and depths to stories, while chronology ensures coherence and flow.

**Chronology in Narrative Structures**

- **Interruption & Parallelism**:
  - Varying time sequences by techniques like elimination, condensation, or parallel development affects the chronology.
  - Elimination results in gaps, sometimes unnoticed by readers.
  - Ellipsis (omission of a series element) can imply signification. For instance, Robbe-Grillet’s "Voyeur" omits an essential event, adding depth to the narrative.
  
- **Significance of Ellipsis**:
  - Certain narrative techniques, like skipping events, can hint at deeper meanings. For example, in "Madame Bovary", the ellipsis suggests the unimportance of Emma Bovary's pregnancy and a lackluster relationship with Charles.
  
- **Parallel Strings & Vagueness**:
  - Having multiple parallel events can confuse the chronological sequence.
  - Simultaneous happenings might be vague, yet significant. For example, in García Márquez’s "One Hundred Years of Solitude", multiple storylines turn a century into an eternity.
  - Achronicity, or the lack of precise chronology, may result from intertwining plot lines.
  
- **Logical Sequence vs. Chronological Sequence**:
  - Sequences can be logical; e.g., old age follows youth.
  - The chronological order isn't always the same as the order of presentation.
  - Misconceptions exist between chronological and causal connections. Not everything happening first is superior.
  - Biblical interpretation: Genesis 2's account of creation can be misinterpreted if chronological priority is confused with qualitative priority.
  
- **Benefits of Structuralist Analysis**:
  - Focusing only on chronological connections helps debunk misconceptions.
  - Comparing and contrasting timespans with chronology allows for a deeper understanding of event significance.

**Key Idea**: Chronological alterations and narrative techniques in storytelling provide deeper insights and nuances, reshaping readers' perception of the fabula (sequence of events).

## 5. Location

**Location in Literature: The Significance and Role of Spatial Dimensions in Narratives**

- **Human Imagination & Space**
  - Humans often deduce or supply locations in narratives, even if not explicitly mentioned.
  - Russian semiotician Lotman highlights the prominence of spatial thinking in the human mind.
  - Abstract concepts are often described using spatial terms, e.g., "infinite" and "distance".

- **Spatial Elements in Fabulas**
  - Spatial elements hold importance in storylines.
  - Analyzing the location of events in narratives can reveal patterns and connections between characters, events, and places.
  - Locations can be categorized into groups to understand their relationships.

- **Location Oppositions & Meanings**
  - Inside vs. Outside: The inside can suggest protection or confinement; outside can imply danger or freedom.
  - City vs. Country: Varied interpretations, from urban decay versus rural purity to the allure of city wealth against the simplicity of country life.
  - High vs. Low, Far vs. Near, and Open vs. Closed: Oppositions rooted in both mythology and human perception.

- **Transitory Places & Vehicles**
  - Transitional locations, like doorways, shops, and beaches, serve as mediators between two contrasting spaces.
  - Vehicles, like trains or boats, can symbolize temporary suspensions of societal norms and predictability.
  - Locations can have narrative significance. For example, the "Pénétrante Ouest" road in Chamoiseau’s Texaco had transformative implications for the story.

- **Oppositions as Narrative Tools**
  - Oppositions provide a simplified structure to complex content.
  - Deconstructive criticism warns against naturalizing these oppositions; they are not perfect in logic.
  - Oppositions can be both a narrative trap and a tool. Critics should confront their biases and not just confirm or denounce the oppositions they notice.

**Key Idea:** The spatial dimensions in narratives, whether explicit or implied, play a pivotal role in shaping stories, emphasizing oppositions, and providing depth to characters and events.
