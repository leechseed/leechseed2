# Dramatica Glossary 
## A
Certainly, here is the text with the bullet points removed:

**Ability (Variation):** This term refers to a character's capacity to handle a task. It recognizes that even with great ability, experience may still be needed to make it practical. Additionally, limitations, whether self-imposed or external, can affect a character's ability.

**Ability (Element):** This represents a character's inherent capacity to do or be something, implying the potential for various abilities. It doesn't necessarily mean the character has developed these abilities.

**Acceptance (Element):** This term describes a character's decision not to oppose or resist external events. It can lead to fewer conflicts but may also allow negative situations to persist unchallenged.

**Accurate (Element):** It refers to an understanding or perception that falls within certain tolerances or is mostly true. Characters with this trait accept rough approximations and don't obsess over perfection.

**Act (Structural Term):** In storytelling, an act is a noticeable division in the dramatic flow of a story. It's created by the convergence of character, theme, and plot elements. A complete storyform contains all the thematic story points, perspectives, and their order within these acts.

**Action (Plot Dynamic):** Actions within a story force decisions. In an Action story, actions drive the plot's progression, and the story often begins, ends, and marks each act with significant actions.

**Activity (Physics) (Class):** This class deals with actions, initiatives, and endeavors, focusing on dynamic processes.

**Actual Dilemma (Overview Appreciation):** This term describes a story situation in which the Main Character must change to achieve success but cannot be absolutely certain of the outcome, often requiring a "leap of faith."

**Actual Work (Overview Appreciation):** In this type of story, remaining steadfast leads to success when the Main Character's appraisal aligns with the reality of the situation.

**Actuality (Element):** Actuality refers to the true state of things. Characters with this trait prioritize substance and facts, seeing through image and pretense.

**Analysis (Variation):** Analysis involves evaluating a situation or circumstances. It's about interpreting available data to establish an effective approach.

**Antagonist (Archetype):** The antagonist is an archetypal character in a story who opposes the protagonist. They are in direct conflict, with opposing goals.

**Apparent Dilemma (Overview Appreciation):** This term describes a story situation where the Main Character mistakenly believes they are on the wrong path, even though they might actually be on the right one.

**Apparent Work (Overview Appreciation):** In this type of story, the Main Character mistakenly believes they are on the correct path, even if that's not the case.

**Appraisal (Variation):** Appraisal refers to a character's initial understanding or impression based on available evidence.

**Appreciations:** These are story points within Dramatica theory, covering character traits, dynamics, and thematic elements.

**Approach (Character Dynamic):** It describes the Main Character's preferred problem-solving method, whether they tend to adapt their environment to themselves or adapt themselves to their environment.

**Approach (Variation):** Approach refers to the manner in which a character seeks solutions to problems. It can be influenced by their temperament, defining how they approach challenges.

**Archetypal Characters:** These are eight characters created by grouping like elements together, often used in stories focused on plot, action, or external themes.

**Argument (Dramatica Term):** The argument in a story is the underlying message conveyed by its structure and dynamics. It can be dispassionate (related to problem-solving) or passionate (related to worldview).

**Attempt (Variation):** Attempt involves applying oneself to something despite uncertainty about success. Characters might attempt something even if they are unsure of the outcome.

**Attitude (Variation):** Attitude refers to a character's demeanor while pursuing an approach. It defines how a character carries out their chosen approach.

**Attraction (Variation):** Attraction describes the positive reward or draw associated with what a character is striving to achieve.

**Author's Proof (Storytelling):** This term refers to the epilogue or follow-up to a story that illustrates the story's outcome, whether it's real or imagined, good or bad.

**Avoid (Element):** Avoid involves avoiding, escaping, or preventing a problem rather than directly solving it. Characters with this trait might try to escape or prevent issues.

**Aware (Element):** Awareness represents a character's consciousness of things outside themselves. Characters with this trait are highly perceptive of their surroundings.
## B

**Backstory (Storytelling):** Backstory refers to the events and forces that lead to the intersection of the Main Character and the story's problem or the development of the story problem over time. It doesn't need to be presented to the audience but can provide insights into how to avoid the problem before it becomes a central issue. Backstory can be integrated smoothly into the story or explored episodically through techniques like flashbacks.

**Bad (Plot Dynamic):** In a story, the "bad" judgment means that the Main Character fails to resolve their personal problems by the end, even if the story's overall goal is achieved successfully. Regardless of whether the overall story ends in success or failure, if the Main Character's personal issues remain unresolved, the outcome is considered "bad."

**Be-er (Character Dynamic):** A Be-er is a Main Character who prefers to adapt themselves to their environment rather than directly addressing external challenges.

**Benchmark (Stipulation):** A benchmark is an indicator used to measure the depth of difficulties within a throughline (a storyline). It helps assess progress in that throughline and is applied in the Overall Story to determine how close the characters are to solving their problem.

**Blind Spot (Character Appreciation):** The Blind Spot refers to the motivations that Subjective Characters (like the Main and Impact Characters) cannot see about themselves. It drives their behavior but operates below their conscious awareness. In a Change Character, the Blind Spot is the source of the common problem in both Overall and Subjective stories. In a Steadfast Character, it motivates them to be the agent of the common solution.

**Both (Overview Appreciation):** In some stories, both men and women tend to empathize with the Main Character, feeling as though they are standing in the Main Character's shoes. This dynamic suggests that both male and female audience members are likely to empathize rather than sympathize with the Main Character in the story.

## C
**Catalyst (Variation):** The Catalyst is an element in a story that always pushes the narrative forward, often by creating breakthroughs or accelerating the story's progress. It helps overcome "log-jams" in both Overall and Subjective Stories when the plot seems stuck, either by solving a puzzle or by making the existing problem seem less important.

**Cause (Element):** Cause represents the specific circumstances that lead to a particular effect. Characters with the Cause characteristic focus on understanding the reasons behind a situation or its circumstances. They may either pinpoint the single source of a problem or attempt to address multiple factors, sometimes ignoring the option of dealing directly with the effect.

**Certainty (Element):** Certainty is the belief that something is unquestionably true. Characters with the Certainty characteristic are risk-averse and need complete assurance before taking action or accepting information as true. They are hesitant and may miss opportunities due to their unwillingness to accept potential errors or changes.

**Change Character (Character Appreciation):** The Change Character is a subjective character in a story who changes their approach or attitude in an attempt to resolve their personal problem. This character can be either the Main Character or the Impact Character but not both. A Change Character cannot predict whether their change will lead to success or problem resolution until the end of the story.

**Change (Character Dynamic):** In character dynamics, Change refers to the Main Character altering their essential nature while trying to solve their problems. The Main Character represents a unique character element that can either cause or resolve the story's problem. Near the story's climax, the Main Character must decide whether to stick with their original approach or switch to the opposite trait, signifying a change.

**Changing One's Nature (Becoming) (Type):** Changing One's Nature or Becoming involves transforming one's identity to embody something different, going beyond merely pretending to be something. It requires letting go of parts of oneself inconsistent with the desired identity.

**Chaos (Element):** Chaos represents disorder, randomness, and anarchy. Characters with the Chaos characteristic tend to disrupt established patterns and structures. They may cut through obstacles but also risk causing unintended chaos and turmoil.

**Character (Dramatica Definition):** In Dramatica, Characters are divided into two major categories: Subjective Characters and Overall Story Characters. Subjective Characters include the Main Character and the Impact Character, while Overall Story Characters encompass all other characters in the story. Overall Story Characters are defined by a specific collection of dramatic elements that remain consistent throughout the story.

**Charge (Dynamic Term):** In a quad of dynamic pairs, Charge distinguishes between pairs, such as Dynamic, Dependent, and Companion. Positive or negative charge indicates opposite attributes in a pair, allowing for specific reference within a quad.

**Choice (Variation):** Choice refers to the act of making a decision, weighing pros and cons to determine the best path for problem resolution. Characters may make choices based on incomplete information, leading to unforeseen consequences.

**Circumstances (Variation):** Circumstances describe a character's emotional evaluation of their environment. It reflects how a character feels about their surroundings and can influence their actions. Characters may accept unfulfilling circumstances for the benefits of a satisfying situation or vice versa.

**Class (Structural Term):** Class is the broadest classification of where problems can exist in a story. It divides problem areas into four categories: Situation (Universe), Activity (Physics), Fixed Attitude (Mind), and Manipulation (Psychology).

**Closure (Variation):** Closure can represent either an ending that prevents change or a continuance that perpetuates a process. It is used to signify resolution in various ways, either by settling dramatic potentials or indicating that certain relationships remain unending.

**Co-Dynamic Pair (Structural Term):** The Co-Dynamic Pair refers to the second dynamic pair in a quad when one pair is identified as the "Reference Pair." It helps distinguish and specify relationships within a quad.

**Commitment (Variation):** Commitment involves deciding to stick with a course of action regardless of the consequences. Committed characters are dedicated and less likely to re-evaluate their path when obstacles arise.

**Complex Characters:** A character becomes complex when even a single element is added, removed, or altered from an Archetypal character. Complex characters provide storytelling depth by allowing exploration of specific traits while underplaying others.

**Conceiving An Idea (Type):** Conceiving An Idea refers to the process of arriving at an idea, while Conceptualizing involves developing a specific plan based on that idea.

**Concern (Overall Storyline):** Concern represents the goal or purpose pursued by the Overall Story Characters in a story. It reflects what these characters are striving to understand or achieve.

**Conditioning (Variation):** Conditioning describes learned responses to stimuli based on training or familiarity. It differs from instinct, as it is not inherent in a character's nature but acquired through experience.

**Confidence (Variation):** Confidence is the belief in the accuracy of an expectation regarding future outcomes. Characters with confidence tend to be optimistic but may overlook potential dangers due to their positive expectations.

**Conscience (Element):** Conscience motivates characters to forgo immediate benefits because of potential future consequences. It prevents characters from acting on present desires when they believe negative consequences are unavoidable.

**Consequence (Overall Storyline):** Consequence is the result of failing to achieve a goal in the Overall Story. It reflects the damages or outcomes that occur as a result of not meeting the story's requirements.

**Critical Flaw (Variation):** The Critical Flaw is a trait unique to the Main Character, balancing their Unique Ability. It represents a vulnerability that threatens the Main Character's success, providing a counterbalance to their exceptional qualities.

**Crucial Element (Element):** The Crucial Element in a story is the single element that needs to be exchanged for its dynamic pair to correct the imbalance that initiated the story.

**Current (Dynamic Term):** Current refers to the flow of a process within a quad of dynamic pairs. It doesn't necessarily create change but can provide motivation or influence the story in subtle ways other than through conflict.

## D

**Decision (Plot Dynamic):** In storytelling, both decisions and actions drive the plot. A "Decision story" typically has more intense deliberation than action, while an "Action story" focuses more on physical events. However, Dramatica views actions and decisions differently. Either actions lead to the need for decisions, or decisions lead to the need for actions. If decisions drive the plot's progression, it's considered a Decision story.

**Deduction (Element):** Deduction is a thought process that arrives at a conclusion by eliminating all competing theories that have holes, leaving only one option. It's akin to the phrase, "When you have ruled out the impossible, whatever is left, no matter how improbable, must be true." However, Deduction may fail to consider alternative truths or theories.

**Deficiency (Variation):** Deficiency represents motivation based on a lack. When a character lacks something, they may not even understand what they lack, but fulfilling this deficiency drives them. Fulfilling the deficiency can change the character's purpose and needs.

**Delay (Variation):** Delay is the decision not to make a decision when options are too balanced or information is insufficient. Characters delay to gather more information or wait for a clear path. However, this can lead to unresolved problems affecting the character's actions later.

**Denial (Variation):** Denial is the refusal to accept that something is closed or over. It goes beyond not accepting conclusions; it can also involve denying that a process will repeat. Characters in denial may keep pursuing an unwinnable situation, refusing to accept that they are chasing their own tail.

**Desire (Variation and Element):** Desire is the motivation to change one's situation based on the perception that something better exists. Characters with desire imagine a better future, even if there's a gap between perception and reality.

**Destiny (Variation):** Destiny is the path an individual will take, involving a series of fates or experiences. Characters may try to deny destiny by changing their path, only to discover that all roads lead to the same destination.

**Determination (Element):** Determination is an evaluation of the forces driving a process, allowing one to anticipate future effects. However, determination may lead characters to focus on the wrong causes, as they might not understand the true forces at play.

**Developing A Plan (Conceptualizing) (Type):** This type involves visualizing the practical implementation of an idea. It requires developing a concrete mental model of how an idea can be made manifest.

**Dilemma Stories vs. Work Stories:** Dilemma stories focus on a main character who changes, while work stories involve a steadfast main character. The key is whether the main character ultimately succeeds or fails in their approach.

**Direction (Character Dynamic):** Direction relates to how characters deal with the overall story problem. Characters may choose a direction based on their beliefs about the problem's source and potential solutions.

**Disbelief (Element):** Disbelief is the belief that something is untrue, different from a lack of faith. It involves absolute confidence that something is not true, even when evidence suggests otherwise.

**Dividend (Overall Storyline Type):** Dividend refers to the benefits gained while working toward the story's goal. These benefits can motivate characters to continue their efforts or even lead them to change their path.

**Do-er (Character Dynamic):** A do-er is a main character who prefers to adapt their environment to themselves, focusing on physical solutions to problems.

**Doing (Type):** Doing involves engaging in physical activities or actions, driven by various motivations or needs.

**Driver (Plot Dynamic):** The driver is the kind of activity that primarily focuses on solving the story's problem, whether through actions or decisions.

**Dynamic Pair (Structural Term):** Dynamic pairs are pairs of items that are extreme opposites, either in conflict or synthesis, within a quad.

**Dynamics (Storytelling Forces):** Dynamics are the dramatic forces that determine the course of a story. They involve choices between alternative forces, such as "Success or Failure" and "Change or Steadfast."



## E

**Effect (Element):** Effect is the specific outcome resulting from a cause or a series of efforts. It's essential to focus on both the effect and its underlying cause.

**Element (Structural Term):** There are 64 elements in each class, and they represent the most refined and detailed approaches and attitudes for solving a story's problem. Elements are the building blocks of characters, and they need to be addressed from all possible directions in a story to fully explore its thematic message.

**Emotion (Archetype):** This archetype represents characters who react passionately to events without considering the consequences or the best course of action. They feel deeply but struggle to channel their emotions effectively.

**Ending (Element):** Characters with the Ending characteristic are preoccupied with when a process or situation will conclude. They may want to speed it up or prevent it, but they are focused on the end, even when some things are unending.

**Enlightenment (Variation):** Enlightenment represents an understanding that transcends knowledge. It's the ability to synthesize abstract truth beyond what is observed, often involving insights that go beyond practical experience.

**Equity (Element):** Equity seeks balance and fairness in situations. Characters with this characteristic strive to maintain equilibrium but may not realize that some inequity is necessary for motivation and progress.

**Essence (Overview Appreciation):** Essence is the primary dramatic feel of a story, which is determined by the direction in which the main character is growing and the author's value judgment of that growth. Positive and negative elements affect the audience's focus on finding solutions or escaping problems in the story.

**Evaluation (Element):** Evaluation involves finding meaning in a situation or circumstances by understanding how all the parts fit together. However, it can lead to issues if evaluations are not updated to reflect changing circumstances.

**Evidence (Variation):** Evidence represents information gathered to develop an understanding about something. Characters may focus on evidence within predefined categories and miss broader information.

**Expectation (Element):** Expectation is the projection of what one expects to find at the end of a path, allowing characters to anticipate rewards and troubles. However, unquestioned expectations can lead to surprises.

**Expediency (Variation):** Expediency involves doing what is necessary to avoid potential consequences, whether from the environment or internal pressure. It's not just about efficiency but also about avoiding future punishment or disappointment.

**Experience (Variation):** Experience refers to gaining familiarity with activities through observation or participation. However, having experience doesn't necessarily mean one is skilled; true expertise combines experience with innate skills.

## F

**Fact (Variation):** Fact represents something that is truly real, as opposed to something that only seems to be real. It's a belief in something real and can become a source of conflict when a character's beliefs are challenged.

**Failure (Plot Dynamic):** In storytelling, failure occurs when the original goal set at the beginning of the story is not achieved. Failure doesn't necessarily mean a bad outcome; it can result from a change in character perspective or realization.

**Faith (Element):** Faith is the belief in something without the support of proof. It's a strong motivator but can prevent characters from questioning their motivations or adapting to changing circumstances.

**Falsehood (Variation):** Falsehood refers to something that has been shown to be erroneous or misleading, even if it may contain elements of truth. It can lead to misconceptions and misunderstandings.

**Family (Structural Term):** In Dramatica's structure, all units are divided into four major groups known as Families: Elements, Variations, Types, and Classes.

**Fantasy (Variation):** Fantasy represents beliefs in something unreal, whether it's a misinterpretation of reality or an internal fabrication. Fantasies can be a way to clarify goals, but if they extend beyond the goal, they can hinder progress.

**Fate (Variation):** Fate is a specific situation or circumstance that will befall an individual at a particular point in time. It's distinct from destiny, which is the overall direction one's life must take.

**Feeling (Element):** Feeling is the mental process of seeking fulfillment or explanations based on emotions. It prioritizes what "feels" right over what is practical or efficient.

**Female Mental Sex (Character Dynamic):** This dynamic describes the problem-solving techniques of a Main Character with a female mindset. It involves assessing balance, creating surpluses or deficiencies, and manipulating energies.

**Female (Overview Appreciation):** This indicates that female audience members are more likely to empathize with the Main Character in the story, while male audience members tend to sympathize.

**Fixed Attitude (Mind) (Class):** Fixed Attitude represents a fixed attitude or bias, often held by a group of characters. It includes unchanging beliefs or prejudices.

**Flashbacks and Flashforwards (Storytelling):** These storytelling techniques involve presenting both the story and backstory simultaneously, with flashbacks showing past events and flashforwards revealing future outcomes.

**Focus (Element):** The Focus Element describes how the Main Character perceives the problem in the story. It can be either in the environment (Do-er) or within themselves (Be-er).

**Forewarnings (Overall Storyline) (Type):** Forewarnings indicate the approach of consequences in the story. They help build tension and force the story to its limits, often leading to a resolution.

**Future (The Future) (Type):** A story focused on the Future explores what will happen or what will be, whether in external or internal issues. Characters may seek to discover or achieve future outcomes.

## G

**Gathering Information (Type):** Gathering Information is the central objective of a story. The Goal in a story doesn't have to be a physical object; it can be a state of mind, enlightenment, feeling, knowledge, desire, or ability. Throughout the story, the value and attainability of the Goal become clearer.

**Good (Plot Dynamic):** In storytelling, "Good" refers to a judgment where the Main Character's personal problems are resolved by the end of the story. Success in achieving the story's goal may or may not be good for the Main Character, as success doesn't necessarily equate to personal resolution.

**Grand Argument Story (Dramatica Term):** A Grand Argument Story encompasses all four throughlines (Overall Story, Subjective Story, Main Character, and Impact Character) to present a complete and consistent perspective of the story's problem. It explores each perspective entirely to create an argument that is difficult to disprove within its own terms.

**Growth (Character Dynamic):** Growth describes how a character changes or remains steadfast in their attempt to solve problems. Change characters see their problems as inside themselves and may need to "start" or "stop" something to grow. Steadfast characters see their problems as external and either hold out for something to "start" or "stop."

**Guardian (Archetype):** The Guardian archetype represents motivations of Conscience and Help. They act as teachers or helpers to the Protagonist, providing guidance and moral judgment. The Guardian often counterbalances the Contagonist's efforts and needs to be nullified before the climax of the story to avoid interference.

## H


**Help (Element):** Help is the characteristic of providing direct assistance to another's efforts to achieve their goal. It can be beneficial to someone who needs support, but sometimes, the character offering help might misread the situation, hindering rather than assisting.

**Hinder (Element):** Hinder is the characteristic of actively detracting from another's efforts to achieve their goal. It doesn't inherently imply whether this is a good or bad action; it simply describes the effect on the plans of the character being hindered.

**Hope (Variation):** Hope is the desired future outcome if things go as expected based on the present situation and the direction of change. It's a projection that acknowledges the potential for change but does not guarantee it. Accurate evaluation of potential changes determines whether a character is hoping or simply dreaming.

**How Things Are Changing (Progress):** This refers to the understanding of the ongoing changes in a story. It is related to the Progress element and involves tracking the direction and nature of change within the narrative.

**Hunch (Element):** A hunch is a conclusion drawn based on intuition and circumstantial evidence. While a hunch can be valuable when evidence accumulates, it remains a suspicion and should not be treated as an established fact.

## I

**Impact Character (Subjective Character):** The Impact Character is the character in a story who forces the Main Character to confront their personal problem. From the Main Character's perspective, the Impact Character may seem to be obstructing the Main Character's path to solving their personal problem or trying to divert them from the right path. In an objective view, the Impact Character prevents the Main Character from ignoring their personal problem, pushing them to address it directly.

**Impact Character's Concern (Type):** This represents what the Impact Character cares about or their goals. The Impact Character's actions and motivations are linked to this concern, whether concrete or abstract, and it depends on the Impact Character's Throughline and the author's creative choices.

**Impact Character's Critical Flaw (Variation):** The Critical Flaw is a trait unique to the Impact Character, undermining their effectiveness, especially concerning their Unique Ability. It prevents them from overpowering the Main Character completely.

**Impact Character's Direction (Element):** The Direction represents what the Impact Character believes is the solution to their problems based on their perspective. It reflects their intended path for finding a solution.

**Impact Character's Throughline (Throughline):** This is the broadest description of the Impact Character's impact within the story. It defines what the Impact Character represents and their role in the narrative.

**Impact Character's Focus (Element):** This element describes where the Impact Character believes their problem lies. It relates to their subjective viewpoint and focuses on how the problem appears to them.

**Impact Character's Problem (Element):** The Problem represents what drives the Impact Character. If they Change in response to the Main Character's Steadfastness, they exchange their Problem for the Solution. If they remain Steadfast, they hold onto their Problem.

**Impact Character's Issue (Variation):** The Issue captures the essence of what the Impact Character represents in the story. It relates to their actions, intentions, and the passionate argument they embody.

**Impact Character's Solution (Element):** The Solution Element is the counterpart to the Problem Element for the Impact Character. It describes what would alleviate the Impact Character's drive.

**Impact Character's Benchmark (Type):** The Benchmark is a standard used to measure the Impact Character's concern and how it changes throughout the story. It provides a gauge for tracking their progress.

**Impact Character's Unique Ability (Variation):** This element highlights what makes the Impact Character uniquely qualified to challenge the Main Character. It grants them a specific power to influence the Main Character's journey.

## J K L


**Judgment (Plot Dynamic):** Judgment in storytelling is the author's assessment of whether or not the Main Character has resolved their personal problem. It goes beyond the simplistic idea of good guys winning and bad guys losing. Instead, it's a moralistic judgment of the Main Character's success or failure in resolving their personal issues. This judgment can be Good or Bad, reflecting the value placed on the character's growth as a human being.

**Justification:** Justification is a complex mental process that helps individuals reconcile exceptions to their personally held truths while maintaining their position on those truths. It involves understanding the connections between processes and results and accepting these connections as unchanging and absolute. Justification can lead to both beneficial learning and detrimental blind spots, depending on how it's applied.

**Knowledge (Variation):** Knowledge represents what a character believes to be true, even if it may not be accurate. It's the gap between what is known and what is true that can create misconceptions and inaccuracies. Characters with the Knowledge variation rely on what they believe to be true to solve problems, which can lead to both advantages and disadvantages.

**Knowledge (Element):** Knowledge as an Element describes a character's urge to use what they believe to be true to find parallels and understanding that can be applied to an issue. This can be advantageous because it skips non-essential re-evaluations, but it can also lead to inflexibility and closed-mindedness if the character believes they don't need to re-examine their knowledge.

**Leap of Faith:** In storytelling, the Leap of Faith is the moment when the Main Character must choose to either Change or remain Steadfast in their approach or attitude, even when they can't be sure which path will lead to success. It's a commitment to a course of action, stepping into the unknown with faith in a favorable outcome or resignation to an ostensibly poor one.

**Limit (Plot Dynamic):** The Limit is a storytelling device that forces the story to a climax by restricting the amount of time or options available. It can be either an Optionlock, where characters run out of options, or a Timelock, where time runs out. Once the Limit is reached, the story must end, and the outcomes are assessed.

**Logic (Element):** Logic as an Element represents a character's rational sense of how things are related. Characters with this characteristic choose the most efficient course or explanation based on reason, aiming for simplicity. However, they may ignore emotional aspects or others' feelings, causing potential backlash.

## M


**Main Character:** In a story, the Main Character is the central character through whom the audience experiences the narrative subjectively. This character can either be Steadfast, holding onto their resolve, or a Change Character who alters their nature to resolve their problems. The Main Character's perspective provides the emotional and sometimes dispassionate argument of the story.

**Main Character's Concern:** This refers to the personal objective or purpose of the Main Character, indicating what they are striving to attain. It can involve concrete or abstract goals, depending on the character's Throughline and the author's narrative twist.

**Main Character's Critical Flaw:** To balance the Main Character's exceptional qualities, they are given a Critical Flaw, a vulnerability that can threaten their success. This flaw is unique to the character and may be mundane but must pose a real threat to their goals.

**Main Character's Direction:** It represents the Main Character's perceived path to a solution for their apparent problems, even if they aren't certain if it's the right one. The Direction reflects their initial strategy or approach.

**Main Character's Throughline:** The Main Character Throughline describes the broad area in which the Main Character operates within the story, focusing on everything related to them as an individual.

**Main Character's Focus:** This element reveals where the Main Character believes the problem exists. It could be between themselves and their environment or solely within one of these aspects. It can help determine whether the Main Character is a "Do-er" or a "Be-er."

**Main Character Problem:** This element represents the source of the Main Character's motivation and problems. If the Main Character changes themselves during the story, they exchange their Problem for a Solution. If they remain Steadfast, they hold onto their Problem.

**Main Character's Issue:** The Issue captures the essence of what the Main Character represents in the story, defining their thematic focus and the nature of their actions and intentions.

**Main Character's Solution:** The Solution is what the Main Character needs to satisfy their motivation and resolve their problems. It's the counterpart to the Problem element and can lead to either a "Start" or "Stop" story.

**Main Character's Benchmark:** It serves as a measuring stick to gauge how deeply the Main Character is dealing with their issues in the story. It can be illustrated through various elements in the narrative.

**Main Character's Unique Ability:** This is the quality that makes the Main Character uniquely qualified to solve the story's problem or achieve the goal. It need not be extraordinary but must be the one crucial quality required that is shared by no one else.

**Main vs. Impact Story:** Describes the relationship between the Main Character and Impact Character (often a protagonist and antagonist). It explores how the Main Character's personal growth or change affects the overall story's dynamics.

**Male Mental Sex:** Indicates that the Main Character uses male problem-solving techniques, focusing on causal relationships and affecting causes and effects.

**Manipulation (Psychology):** Part of the psychology class that explores how attitudes change. It looks at the ways of thinking and mental processes that characters employ.

**Memory:** This type represents subjective recollections of past events and how current feelings can stem from memories, both pleasant and unpleasant.

**Mental Sex:** A determination of the Main Character's mental operating system, whether it leans more toward traditionally male or female traits.

**Methodology:** The elements a character implements to achieve their purposes, reflecting the means used to reach their goals.

**Morality:** Refers to a character's inclination to prioritize the needs of others before their own. It's not limited to spiritual or religious notions of right and wrong.

**Motivation:** Elements that represent the drives behind a character's purposes or goals, reflecting the forces that push them in a particular direction within the story.

## N O


**Nature**: Stories can be categorized into four types based on their structure: Actual Work, Actual Dilemma, Apparent Work, and Apparent Dilemma. These categories help determine the relationship between the Main Character's beliefs and the actual problem's location.

**Need**: Need is subjective and depends on what is required to fulfill a purpose. It's not an objective necessity but rather a judgment of what's lacking to achieve a goal.

**Negative Feel**: Stories can have either a positive or negative feel based on the direction of tension. Positive stories focus on characters pursuing a solution, while negative stories emphasize characters being hindered by a problem.

**Neither**: Some stories make both male and female audiences sympathize with the Main Character, neither empathizing nor sympathizing more strongly with either gender.

**Non-Acceptance**: This trait indicates a character's refusal to compromise and stands firm, even on minor issues, which can be both advantageous and problematic.

**Non-Accurate**: Non-Accurate describes concepts that are not functional for a specific purpose and are inconsistent in their application.

**Optionlock**: In stories with an optionlock, the climax occurs because all other options have been exhausted, forcing a resolution.

**Overall Story Catalyst**: This is an element that propels the Overall Story forward, creating breakthroughs and accelerating its development.

**Outcome**: Outcome assesses how things end up in a story, including what potentials remain and how they've changed throughout the narrative.

**Overview Story Points**: These are story elements related to the broader understanding of the entire narrative, including the story's structure, themes, and overall feel.

These concepts help authors analyze and develop their stories, making them more effective and engaging for audiences.

**Protagonist**: An archetype representing the motivations of Pursuit and Consider, responsible for pursuing a solution to the story's objective problem.

**Protection**: Effort to prevent one's concerns from being vulnerable to interference, often involving building defenses against potential threats.

**Quad**: This term refers to a group of four dramatic units, where each unit possesses a similar quality. These groups of four units can control dramatic direction and flow and are represented as a square divided into four quadrants. Special relationships and functions exist between diagonal, horizontal, and vertical pairs within each quad.

## R

**Range**: Range is associated with the variation called "Issue Rationalization." Rationalization is when a character uses a logical alternative to mask the real reason for their actions. They may make excuses or fabricate artificial reasons to justify their behavior.

**Reach**: Reach describes the relationship between the audience and the Main Character in a story. It explains how the audience identifies with the Main Character. It can be either empathy (seeing the story through the Main Character's eyes) or sympathy (standing next to the Main Character as a close acquaintance), depending on various story dynamics and the audience's gender.

**Reaction**: Reaction is an element that represents actions made in response to a problem. It's characterized by a character striking back at the source of a problem, usually after the problem has materialized.

**Reappraisal**: Reappraisal is a variation associated with the element "Appraisal." It involves reconsidering a conclusion based on additional information, helping to stay on the right track. However, characters with this trait can be influenced by recent events and may discount earlier conclusions in favor of more recent, potentially misleading information.

**Reason**: Reason is an archetype representing the motivations of Logic and Control. Characters with this archetype act based on calm logic, without becoming emotionally involved in decisions. However, such characters can be challenging to empathize with, so they may be altered to provide more potential for audience empathy.

**Reconsider**: Reconsider is an element representing the drive to reexamine one's conclusions in light of new information. This can lead to a pragmatic approach but may undermine resolve when faced with obstacles.

**Reduction**: Reduction is another element that deals with determining probability. It involves comparing the likelihood of several incomplete lines of deduction to arrive at the most likely conclusion, even when dealing with incomplete data.

**Reevaluation**: Reevaluation is the act of reconsidering one's initial impressions, whether about a person, situation, goal, or oneself. Characters with this trait may be swayed by new, misleading information, leading to mistaken understandings.

**Repulsion**: Repulsion is a variation that deals with pushing away or being pushed away from something. Characters may be discouraged from pursuing a goal or action based on a sense of foreboding or unattractiveness.

**Requirements (Overall Storyline)**: In the context of the overall storyline, Requirements refer to the necessary pre-cursors and conditions that must be met to achieve a goal.

**Resistance**: Resistance is a dynamic term used to measure the tendency toward inertia in a quad of dramatic components. It represents a force that may deter a potential course of action or interaction.

**Response**: This term relates to the direction of a character's actions in response to a situation.

**Resolve**: Resolve is a character dynamic that describes the degree to which the Main Character feels compelled to remain on their quest or path.

**Responsibility**: Responsibility is a variation involving the belief that one is best suited to accomplish a task, often driven by caring more for others than oneself.

**Result**: Result is an element that considers the ramifications of a specific effect or cause, taking a holistic view of all the end products of a process.

## S
This text discusses various concepts related to Dramatica theory, which is a framework for understanding and analyzing the structure of stories. Here's a summary of the key points without numbering:

**Security**: This concept is about evaluating one's protections and the importance of protecting what has already been achieved. Characters concerned with Security build defenses against known and anticipated threats, but actual dangers may or may not align with the effectiveness of these protections.

**Self-Aware**: Self-Awareness refers to a character's full awareness of their feelings, thoughts, abilities, and knowledge. However, this can lead to the character being overly self-focused and sometimes oblivious to things happening around them.

**Self-Interest**: Self-Interest is the act of making decisions based on what is best for oneself, often without considering the impact on others. It doesn't necessarily imply ill intent but reflects a focus on personal ramifications.

**Sense of Self**: This concept relates to a character's perception of themselves, which may or may not align with their true nature. Sometimes, characters develop a false Sense of Self due to external feedback.

**Senses**: Senses refer to the raw sensory data a character receives. Sometimes, this data is accurate, but other times it may be faulty, leading to errors and misunderstandings.

**Set**: A set is a grouping of 16 units, each with similar natures, often used in story structure analysis.

**Sidekick**: The Sidekick archetype represents faith and support in a story. This character is characterized by unwavering support and can be attached to any main character, not just the protagonist.

**Situation (Universe)**: This class explores fixed states of affairs, such as systems or institutions, in a story. It focuses on the stability of a situation.

**Situation**: Situation describes the practical aspects of a character's environment and how it may evolve or remain constant throughout the story.

**Skill**: Skill refers to innate potential or aptitude, which may or may not be developed through practical experience.

**Solution**: The Solution Element is what's needed to resolve the story's problem. It's the counterpart to the Problem Element.

**Speculation**: Speculation involves extending possibilities into the future, even if they are unlikely. Characters may prepare for unlikely events, which can lead to complications.

**Start**: In a Change story, "Start" refers to the Main Character beginning to do or be something they weren't initially. In a Steadfast story, it's about waiting for something outside to begin.

**State-of-Being**: State-of-Being describes a character's true nature, often unknown to the character themselves.

**Steadfast Character**: This character remains true to their original approach or attitude throughout the story, whether it's part of the problem or solution.

**Steadfast**: In a Main Character's growth, being Steadfast means sticking to their essential nature while trying to solve the story's problem.

**Stipulation**: Stipulation refers to a benchmark or standard by which growth in the story is measured.

**Stop**: In a Change story, "Stop" refers to the Main Character stopping a detrimental trait. In a Steadfast story, it's about waiting for something external to stop.

**Story Mind**: This concept sees a story as an analogy to a single human mind dealing with a problem, encompassing all characters, themes, and plot progressions.

**Story vs. Tale**: A tale describes a problem and the attempt to solve it, while a story argues that a specific approach uniquely leads to success or failure.

**Storyform**: The structural and dynamic skeleton of a story, which contains the essence of the entire argument to be made.

**Storyforming vs. Storytelling**: Storyforming is the creation of the story's dramatic structure, while storytelling is how that structure is illustrated to the audience.

**Storyforming**: The process of creating the dramatic structure of a unique story by arranging structure and dynamics.

**Story Points**: Commonly shared dramatic concepts that are fundamental to all stories.

**Strategy**: A plan or series of interconnected plans intended to produce a desired result.

**Success**: Success in a story means the original goal is achieved, but it doesn't necessarily imply a positive outcome.

**Support**: Support is indirect assistance given to another's efforts, different from direct help.

**Suspicion**: Suspicion involves forming preliminary conclusions with insufficient evidence.

**Sympathy**: Sympathy describes the audience's caring about the Main Character without necessarily identifying with them.

**Symptom**: In the context of story structure, a Symptom is the principal effect or observable result of a problem.

These concepts help authors analyze and develop their stories, making them more effective and engaging for audiences.
## T
Certainly, here is the text with the bullet points removed:

**Temptation**: The urge to pursue immediate benefits despite potential negative consequences. It often involves believing that these negative consequences are either imaginary or can be avoided. The struggle between conscience and temptation is defined by one's faith or disbelief in consequences.

**Tendency**: Represents the degree to which a main character feels compelled to accept a quest. Some characters are naturally inclined to take action (Do-ers), while others prefer deliberation (Be-ers). This inclination influences their willingness to participate in the story's quest.

**Test**: To test is to try out a supposition to determine its validity. Testing is a way to determine if an idea or concept works in the real world. It can be valuable for weeding out faulty ideas but may also waste time when immediate action is needed.

**Theme**: Theme in storytelling refers to the author's statement about the relative worth of different value standards as they relate to the story's central issue. Theme is conveyed by presenting various perspectives on the issue and emphasizing the most appropriate one according to the author.

**Theory**: A theory is an unbroken web of relationships that describes a mechanism, and it must explain how each relationship works. Characters representing theory seek to understand and predict how things work, often requiring them to uncover all the steps in a relationship.

**Thought**: Thought is the process of consideration, which involves examining both logical and emotional aspects of a problem from multiple perspectives. It can illuminate all sides of an issue but may lead to endless deliberation without reaching a decision.

**Threat**: Threat represents an evaluation of one's vulnerabilities and is often associated with danger indicators. Characters may avoid actions based on perceived threats, whether real or imagined, potentially hindering their progress.

**Throughline**: In Dramatica, a throughline is a structural perspective in a story, and there are four types: Overall Story, Subjective Story, Main Character, and Impact Character Throughlines. Each provides a unique viewpoint on the story's events and problems.

**Timelock vs. Optionlock**: These are two types of limits that can force a story to its climax. Timelock involves a time limit, while Optionlock involves limiting the number of solutions or choices available to the characters.

**Trust**: Trust is the acceptance of knowledge as proven without testing its validity. Characters with trust characteristics accept concepts or information without requiring supporting evidence.

**Truth**: Truth is more than facts; it includes meaning and interpretation. It can vary based on intent and purpose, making it subject to debate and differing perspectives.

**Type**: Types are categories within the Dramatica structure that refine the exploration of problem elements in different classes. There are 16 types, grouped into four classes, determining the nature of the plot.



## U V W X Y Z


**Unending**: This characteristic sees nothing as ever coming to completion. What others see as an end, it views as a change of direction. This perspective can be motivating but may also lead to a lack of recognition when something is truly over.

**Uncontrolled**: The character representing Uncontrolled spreads their energy and motivation in all directions simultaneously, resulting in a lack of focus and progress.

**Understanding**: Understanding is distinct from knowledge, as it involves grasping the meaning of something, considering its substance and context. It combines reason and emotion and often requires becoming one with the subject under consideration.

**Unique Ability**: Unique Ability is a quality that makes a character uniquely capable of resolving the story's problem. It can be mundane but must be crucial and integrated into the character's nature.

**Unit**: Units are the smallest meaningful building blocks in the Dramatica story framework.

**Unproven**: Unproven represents knowledge that has not been tested and requires hard data for confirmation, preventing hasty conclusions.

**Unwilling**: Describes a Main Character who is reluctant to become involved in the story's problem and requires external motivation to participate.

**Value**: Value is the objective usefulness or desirability of something in general, but it also contains personal preferences and can be subjective.

**Variation**: Variations in the Dramatica structure describe the thematic message and how it develops in the story.

**Willing**: Describes a Main Character who is self-motivated to find a solution to the story's problem and does not require external encouragement.

**Wisdom**: Wisdom is the understanding of how knowledge fits together, going beyond awareness of facts.

**Work**: Work involves applying oneself to something within one's known abilities. It does not involve surprises or shortcomings.

**Worry**: Concern for the future, often stemming from past experiences of seemingly innocuous situations turning into disasters. Worry can be motivating but may also lead to resource wastage.

**Worth**: Worth describes the subjective value of an item or action to an individual, which varies from person to person.

**Z Pattern**: The Z Pattern, in Dramatica theory, represents the critical relationship between the order of dramatic elements and the audience's interpretation of events within a story. It highlights the significant impact that changing the sequence of events can have on the narrative's meaning and audience perception.

## Structural Models

### The Dramatica Structural Model

![[Pasted image 20230910004623.png]]
The Dramatica Structural Matrix is a framework used for organizing and exploring dramatic elements related to Genre, Plot, Theme, and Character in a story. It allows authors to manipulate these elements like a Rubik's cube to create the desired impact on the audience.
