  - **Narrative Turn (1980s):** Shift to 'narrative' or 'story,' focusing on cognitive constructs over linguistic elements.
  - **Emergence of 'World':** A transition from author/genre-centric to story-centric 'worlds' or 'storyworlds.'

- **Cognitive vs. Ontological Perspectives:**
  - **Cognitive Perspective:** Focuses on how minds construct stories and their worlds, emphasizing mental encoding and decoding during narrative experiences.
  - **Ontological Perspective:** Theoretical inquiries into the nature and existence of imaginative creations, intertwining with cognitive aspects in narrative processing.

- **Understanding Storyworlds:**
  - **Definition and Application:** Storyworlds are not just spatial settings but evolving spatio-temporal totalities influenced by narrative events.
  - **Storyworld vs. Reference World:** Differentiating between the world projected by a text (storyworld) and the real world it refers to (reference world).

- **Components of Storyworlds:**
  - **Intradiegetic Elements:** Existing within the storyworld, forming the narrative's core.
  - **Extradiegetic Elements:** Outside the storyworld but crucial for its presentation, like narrators or framing devices.

- **Expanding Beyond the Text:**
  - Storyworlds include backstories, afterstories, and locations beyond the immediate narrative focus.
  - **Visual Representation:** Depicts the inner circle (story focus) and outer circle (broader spatial and temporal frame).

- **Key Idea:**
  - Storyworlds in narrative theory represent complex, evolving spatio-temporal constructs that extend beyond immediate textual elements, encompassing cognitive and ontological dimensions, and integrating both intradiegetic and extradiegetic elements to form a comprehensive narrative universe.

  - The Internet influences how these narratives are constructed, combining features of orality and writing, and often integrating various media forms.

- **Performative Aspects of Storytelling**:
  - Storytelling is a discursive practice crucial for creating narrative identity, allowing individuals to present coherent selves and re-enact past experiences.
  - Stories often serve as a protective shield for our inner selves, justifying actions and self-presentations.

- **Digital Media's Influence on Storytelling**:
  - Digital systems like blogs, forums, and social networks have transformed storytelling, making it more interactive, personalized, and less monolithic than traditional autobiographies.
  - Internet storytelling often seeks visibility and attention, influenced by both the software used and the social media industry's rhetoric.

- **Impressions and Impression Management Online**:
  - The Internet is a key tool for managing impressions of personality, with studies showing correlations between website designs and perceptions of website owners' personalities.
  - Personal websites and social media profiles contribute significantly to how individuals are perceived by others.

- **Critical Perspectives on Digital Storytelling**:
  - Despite the social media industry promoting values of democracy and participation, digital storytelling can be restrictive due to the imposed rules of user software.
  - The narrative format of social media suggests a hierarchical system where visibility and interaction are more valued than the content itself.

- **Narrative Interviews in the Online Context**:
  - Publishing narrative interviews online changes the dynamics of storytelling, as participants are aware of a potentially large and diverse audience.
  - This awareness might affect how individuals narrate their stories, possibly leading to more polished or altered versions of their experiences.

- **Key Idea**:
"Digital media and the Internet have significantly transformed narrative identity, shaping how individuals construct and share their stories. The performative aspect of storytelling is amplified in the digital age, where visibility and attention become key drivers. While digital storytelling offers new, interactive ways to express oneself, it also imposes constraints and fosters a hierarchy of visibility, influencing both the content and presentation of personal narratives."

- **Phelan’s Narrative Communication Model**:
  - Phelan's model, originally for written narratives, includes a narrator, narratee, and an authorial audience.
  - In interviews, the speaker (or narrator) might be influenced by the anticipated audience, and their narrative may reveal more than intended, akin to Phelan's "disclosure functions."

- **Complexity of the 'Speaker' in Narratives**:
  - The notion of 'speaker' in storytelling is complex and can be divided into animator (voice), author (selector of content), and principal (whose beliefs are expressed).
  - This division is relevant in interviews where speakers might not fully author their stories.

- **Implied Self in Storytelling**:
  - In personal storytelling, the teller creates an "implied self," which may vary in different contexts.
  - This self-presentation can involve unconscious transmission of cultural stories or accommodation to the audience.

- **Narrative Identity and the Internet**:
  - The Internet has transformed narrative identity, with stories on social media becoming more interactive, multimedia, and influenced by the platform's constraints.
  - Internet narratives often seek visibility and attention, and can be shaped by software and cultural templates.

- **Key Idea**:
"Internet-based interviews constitute a special communicative genre where narrators engage with both the interviewer and an anticipated online audience, creating complex layers of narrative identity. These narratives, influenced by the medium and the audience, often showcase an 'implied self' that blends the teller's intentional self-presentation with elements shaped by cultural norms and the expectations of the digital platform."

**Engaging Minds in Internet-Based Interview Narratives: The Case of Rudy Autio**

- **Narrative and Identity in Interviews**:
  - Interviews, especially narrative ones, provide a unique opportunity for speakers to construct their identity through storytelling.
  - The online publication of these interviews adds layers of audience design, as narrators address not just the interviewer but also an anticipated broader internet audience.

- **Complex Speaker Roles in Storytelling**:
  - The speaker in conversational storytelling can be divided into three personas: the narrating persona (telling the story), the narrated persona (the speaker within the story), and the experiencing persona (who re-experiences past events during storytelling).

- **Creating Storyworlds through Focalization**:
  - In Rudy Autio's interview, he creates a vivid storyworld for listeners by describing his experience watching the potter Shoji Hamada.
  - The use of focalization allows listeners to envision the events through Autio's perspective, enhancing engagement and empathy.

- **Setting Up Groups and Creating an 'Implied Self'**:
  - Autio's narrative sets up two groups: exceptional artists like Hamada and the average craft artists, including himself.
  - Through his narrative, Autio subtly presents himself as artistically sensitive and knowledgeable, distinguishing his own artistic understanding.

- **Key Idea**:
"In Internet-based interview narratives, speakers like Rudy Autio use storytelling to engage their audience's minds, creating immersive storyworlds and subtly constructing their 'implied self'. This process is enhanced by the use of focalization and narrative strategies that reflect on the speaker's identity, artistic sensitivity, and understanding, thus inviting listeners to connect deeply with the narrated experiences."


**Engaging Minds in Patient Experience Narratives: Woman Caring for Partner with Alzheimer’s**

- **Narrative as a Tool for Emotional Engagement and Empathy**:
  - In the interview from healthtalk.org, a woman recounts her experiences caring for her husband with Alzheimer's, using narrative techniques to engage her audience emotionally.
  - The use of constructed dialogue vividly enacts past interactions, conveying both her feelings and those of the medical professionals.

- **Constructed Dialogue as a Window into Minds**:
  - Constructed dialogue is employed to dramatize the narrative, allowing listeners to witness the emotional states and reactions of both the speaker and the others in the story.
  - This technique serves to convey the speaker's emotional response and to highlight the attitudes and affective stances of the characters, particularly the neurologist's irritation and the speaker’s skepticism.

- **Narrative Indirection for Justification and Empathy**:
  - The speaker uses narrative indirection, specifically side-shadowing, to reflect on possible alternate outcomes, inviting the audience to consider different life paths and understand her feelings of loss and frustration.
  - This approach helps justify the speaker's moral stance and creates empathy, allowing the audience to connect more deeply with her experience.

- **Key Idea**:
"In patient experience narratives, like the one of a woman caring for her partner with Alzheimer's, speakers effectively use narrative techniques like constructed dialogue and narrative indirection to engage the minds of their audience. These techniques allow for a vivid portrayal of emotional states and moral stances, fostering empathy and a deeper understanding of the speaker's experiences and challenges."

**Performing Selves in Oral History Narratives for an Online Audience**

- **Adaptation to Online Audience and Self-Presentation**:
  - Storytellers in oral history interviews, particularly those conducted for Internet databases, tailor their narratives to engage an implied online audience.
  - This adaptation leads to unique rhetorical strategies, reflecting a conscious performance of self for a broader audience.

- **Narrative Complexity and Audience Engagement**:
  - Conversational storytelling, as seen in these interviews, exhibits a level of complexity that can be better understood using narrative-specific analytical tools.
  - The storytelling process involves intricate interactions between the speakers' minds, influencing how the narrative is constructed and perceived.

- **Dynamic Co-Construction of Narratives**:
  - In the example of a couple recounting their love story, the narrative is co-constructed, with both partners actively participating and reinforcing each other's contributions.
  - The use of dramatic modes, direct speech, and re-enactments enhances the emotional and experiential aspect of the story.

- **Representation of Mental and Emotional States**:
  - Storytellers effectively convey their mental and emotional states through narrative techniques like direct speech and dramatic re-enactments.
  - These techniques allow audiences to infer the speakers' inner thoughts and feelings, deepening the engagement with the narrative.

- **Interaction Between Narrator Functions and Disclosure Functions**:
  - The distinction between what is explicitly communicated (narrator functions) and what is subtly revealed or inferred (disclosure functions) is evident in these narratives.
  - Speakers often disclose more about their emotions and thoughts than what is immediately apparent in the narrative's surface structure.

- **Key Idea**:
"In oral history interviews tailored for online platforms, storytellers perform and construct their selves through complex narrative strategies, engaging their audience's minds. These narratives blend explicit communication with subtle disclosures, revealing deeper emotional and mental layers, and highlighting the intricate interplay between narrative construction and mind-in-interaction."

- **Representation of Characters' Minds**:
  - The project aims to convey the qualia of living in the storyworld, revealing the mental models and inferences about characters and situations.
  - It tests the boundaries between fiction and documentary by using fictional techniques in a non-fictional context, such as narrative journalism.

- **Interpretative Strategies Encouraged in Viewers**:
  - The blending of researchers' and informants' discourses encourages viewers to engage in interpretative processes, understanding the emotions and thoughts of the subjects.
  - The exhibition's design and narrative choices frame the winter day, inviting viewers to experience the ordinariness and human interest aspects of the subjects' lives.

- **Key Idea**:
"The 'A Finnish Winter Day' exhibition exemplifies the intricate blending of narrative techniques typically associated with fiction in a documentary context, presenting an immersive and interpretatively rich portrayal of everyday Finnish life. It challenges conventional narrative boundaries, offering viewers a unique window into the experiences and thoughts of its subjects."
