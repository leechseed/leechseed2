## INTRODUCTION
This book is the result of my own **approach to characterization** as developed through the writing of numerous stories and several novels, an approach that has evolved to embrace the insight embodied in the quote from Stendhal that began this Introduction: **Character is not created in isolation or repose; it’s forged through *interaction with others and the world.*** Even in solitary struggles of endurance, such as arduous physical ordeals or battles with illness, there is a contest at the heart of the matter, between the part of us that would surrender and the part that continues on. 

The other main distinctive or innovative approaches addressed in this book include: 
	- Comprehending your characters begins with an honest, unflinching understanding of yourself. 
	- **Scenes**, in which characters engage meaningfully and in conflict with each other, are crucial at all stages of character development: **conception**, **development**, and **portrayal**. Character biographies created from scenes are intrinsically more useful than those consisting of mere information. 
	- **A clear visual image of a character is a beginning, not an end.** If you restrict yourself to a visual image in your “mind’s eye,” you risk contemplating the character like an idea, rather than forging an intuitive engagement with him. 
	- **An intuitive grasp of your character is formed by exploring scenes of profound emotional importance**—moments of overwhelming shame, joy, fear, pride, regret, forgiveness. 
	- Developing a character with genuine depth requires a focus on not just desire but how the character deals with frustration of her desires, as well as her **vulnerabilities**, **her secrets**, and especially **her contradictions**. This development needs to be forged in scenes, the better to employ your intuition rather than your intellect.
	- This reliance on intuition provides the best way to respond meaningfully to what I call the **Tyranny of Motive: the need to understand what a character wants and why he behaves a certain way.** Without an intuitive grasp of the characters, you can all too easily fall into the trap of reducing them to simplistic automatons or “plot puppets,” acting in accordance with ideas or story necessities rather than behaving with the complexity of intention that real individuals possess. 
	- **A character can undergo change through either growth or transformation**, which can be distinguished by determining to what extent the character exhibits not just **strength of will** but **insight in overcoming a personal limitation**. 
	- Character arcs fall within a spectrum based on which protagonist question they most directly pose: 
		- Can I Get What I Want? 
		- Who Am I? or 
		- What Do I Have to Change About Myself to Get What I Want? 
	
There is of course a great deal more within these pages, so much so that it may seem daunting. But you can keep from feeling overwhelmed by thinking of this book as a kind of tool kit. Just as no one uses every tool he owns in the course of any project, so should no one consider employing more than what’s necessary for the task at hand: bringing a given character to life and rendering him on the page.
## Part I - Conceiving the Character 
- This is done in the psychology workbook for writers.

### Chapter One - Fingering Smoke: Are Characters Created or Discovered?
#### Exercises - Characters Derived from Art or Nature
1. Pick two characters from a piece you’re working on. Make a point of noting specifically where your impression of them rests at the end of each working day. The next morning, before you begin to write, revisit each character in your mind’s eye. Do you hear or see—or better yet, feel—the character differently? Does she suggest an ability to act in a way she didn’t when you last visited her? Keep track of your progress over time. How has your intuition of the character evolved? How much of this transformation seems to be the result of your own deliberate work—i.e., creation? How much feels like discovery—i.e., seems to have emerged unconsciously?
### Chapter Two - Summoning Ghosts: Source Materials for Characters
#### Exercises - Characters Based on Real People
Review the following list. Reflect upon the person in your life who fits each description given—jot down her name, fix her in your mind, remember a few details about her life: her physical appearance, the effect she had on you, and anything else you think would be important if you were to describe her to someone who didn’t already know her. Pay particular attention first to those traits you consider fundamental, then second to those traits that surprise or intrigue you. If possible, try to recall a memorable or pivotal event involving you and the person in question: 

- **a.** A family member to whom you feel particularly close
- **b.** A family member from whom you’re estranged or whom you particularly dislike
- **c.** A stranger whose path crossed yours this past week
- **d.** A person you know personally and admire
- **e.** A person you know personally and fear
- **f.** The love who got away
- **g.** The love you wish had gotten away
- **h.** First love
- **i.** Greatest love
- **j.** Greatest childhood nemesis
- **k.** Greatest adulthood nemesis
- **l.** Person from childhood who annoyed you the most
- **m.** Person in your present-day life who annoys you the most
- **n.** Favorite neighbor
- **o.** Least favorite neighbor
- **p.** Favorite coworker
- **q.** Least favorite coworker
- **r.** Your mail carrier or someone else you deal with on a “business” level daily
- **s.** An older person who has inspired you
- **t.** A child who fascinates you
- **u.** Someone on whom you have a secret crush
- **v.** Someone you believe has a crush on you
- **w.** A person who believed in you
- **x.** A person who thought you’d never amount to anything
- **y.** A person you envy
- **z.** A person whose life you would never trade for your own


The first and most important thing this work should inspire is a deeper and more precise emotional connection to the people inhabiting your memory. Take a moment to register that emotional impact fully and meaningfully. We forget so much in the confusing and relentless demands of everyday life. This exercise is an attempt to dredge up from that oblivion what we have forgotten—but not lost. It can also be useful to take distinct eras of your life and ask these questions for each time period. A person who believed in you when you were in elementary school is an excellent character; but so is the one who believed in you when you hit your twenties, or middle age.

### Chapter Three - The Examined Life: Using Personal Experience as an Intuitive Link to the Character
#### Exercises - Composite Characters
1. Take a story idea you’re currently working on. Assemble the dramatis personae you’ll need to make the story work. What do you know already about these characters? What’s conspicuously lacking—names, ages, physical appearance, family backgrounds, type of work they do, fears, loves, hatreds, desires? What else will you have to learn about them to make the story work? What information is conceivably irrelevant? 
2. Give yourself sufficient time without interruption in a quiet place. Let the daily mental business that preoccupies you settle down and fade into the background. Wait until a dreamlike scene or personage forms before your mind’s eye. If you simply see a figure, try to guide it into some form of action. If you see a scene, follow it through to some sense of completion. Write down what you observed. Pay particular attention to the setting—do you recognize it? How? Also attend to the power dynamic between the people in the scene, and its emotional tone. Did the scene touch you in some meaningful way? If not, can you think of supplying something consciously that might create a more emotionally affecting scene? 
3. Go to a book of paintings or photographs and select a person depicted in one of the plates. Insert that character into a scene you’re working on, the less “arty,” the better. What happens? How do the other characters react? What of interest changes? What doesn’t change? If the insertion feels forced, what could you change or add to make it feel more natural? 
4. Select a favorite piece of music and allow it to form a mental impression of a character, or use it as an accent or contrasting element to a character you’re already developing. Place that new or altered character in a scene you’re currently working on. Again: What happens? How do the other characters react? What of interest changes? What doesn’t change? 
5. Compare the results of the characters created for the preceding two exercises. Which of the two character sources—music or painting proved easier to work with, more vivid, more useful? Why? 
6. Select at least five of the people suggested in the list on pages 24–26 and do as the text suggested: Reflect upon the people in your life who fit the description given—jot down his or her name, fix him in your mind. Describe those traits you consider fundamental, then those traits that surprise you. Recall a memorable or pivotal scene involving you and the person. Take a moment to register that emotional impact fully and meaningfully. 
7. Identify and write a brief biographical sketch for three persons from your past not identified in the list provided. What makes them so memorable for you? 
8. Use one of the characters sketched in exercises 6–7 and find a way to use him or her in a piece on which you’re currently working. Does the character enrich the piece or detract from it? In either case, why? 
9. Take any two—or if you’re feeling ambitious, three—characters developed in the preceding exercises and mold them into a composite. Does this new character suggest opportunities for behavior and conflict that none of the sources he’s based on possess? Is there anything about the character that doesn’t seem to fit, suggesting irreconcilable traits, or a need for deeper, more detailed engagement with the character’s backstory or inner life in order to make the fit more organic, more credible?
### Chapter Three - The Examined Life: Using Personal Experience as an Intuitive Link to the Character
#### Exercises - Personal Experience as an Intuitive Link to Character

**The most important emotional incidents to explore in a character’s life, and therefore your own, are:** 
- Moment of greatest fear
- Moment of greatest courage
- Moment of greatest sadness
- Moment of greatest joy
- Moment of deepest shame
- Moment of most profound guilt
- Moment of most redemptive forgiveness
- Moment of greatest pride
- Greatest success (which may not be the same as moment of greatest pride)
- Worst failure
- Most memorable moment of tenderness
- Most shattering incident of violence
- Most life-changing moment of passion
- Moment of greatest danger
- Worst illness
- First experience with death
- Most disturbing experience with death
- Most shattering loss other than death


**The following are some additional “prompts” to key significant emotional moments**
- First time as an adult you told someone you loved him (or her)
- A time you said “I love you” and wished you hadn’t
- A time when you were struck or beaten
- A time you struck or beat someone else
- Most memorable moment with a parent/sibling/child
- Most memorable moment with a stranger
- “Please stop. I’m scared.”
- “Don’t hurt me.”
- “Give that to me.”
- “I’m telling.”
- “Do as you’re told.”
- “I can’t believe I just did that.”
- “I could kill you.”
- “I’m not that kind of person.” (Or “You can’t ask me to do that.”)
- “I thought you loved me.”
- “No matter what I do, it will never be good enough.”


**Exercises**
1. Pick five of the suggested events or prompts in the two lists provided in this chapter and sketch the scene that emerges. Can you detect some thematic thread linking the scenes? What is it? 
2. Create three events or prompts of your own that spur emotionally significant scenes. 
3. Use one of the scenes developed for exercises 1 or 2 and find a way to use it in a piece on which you are currently working. Does it enrich the piece or detract from it? In either case, why? 
4. Identify a moment in your life when you’ve had to face your own misguided, wrongful, or hurtful behavior. Explore the insight that resulted, and how it changed how you acted or even the direction of your life. Provide a similar insight to one of the characters in the scene you’ve rewritten for exercise 3. How does this insight transform the scene? What decision results from the insight, and how does the character change his behavior? If his behavior doesn’t change, why not?

## PART II - Developing the Character
- The most important things that make visual and engagement possible: 
	- **The character needs or wants something**
	- **The character is having difficulty getting what they need or want**
	- **The character develops a plan for overcoming that difficulty**
	-  **The character exhibits a contradiction**
	- **Something unexpected happens which renders them vulnerable**
	- **There is more to their predicament than meets the eye--a secret**
### Chapter Five - Desire as Purpose: A Driving Need, Want, Ambition, or Goal
#### Exercises - Desire as Purpose: A driving Need, Want, Ambition, or Goal
1. Select three books or films you’ve recently enjoyed. Identify the core desire, need, or ambition in at least three main characters. 
2. Do the same for three characters in a piece you’re currently working on, as well as three to five characters you developed in doing the exercises for chapters 2 and 3. 
3. Take the same characters chosen in exercise 2 and ask what would happen to them, what would happen to their stories, if their desires, needs, or ambitions exhibited any of the following: 
	1. The overall desire was an obsessive totem for multiple underlying desires. 
	2. The object of desire changed or became clearer due to conflicts endured. 
	3. The character suffered two irreconcilable desires. 
	4. The conscious desire conflicted with an unconscious one. 
	5. The object of desire was ultimately found to be worthless. 
	6. The character wanted one thing but got something else altogether. 
4. Don’t answer this question simplistically. Chart out how the story would change if it exhibited any of the foregoing characteristics. 
5. What have you learned about your characters by asking these questions?

1. Return to the characters identified in your responses for the first two exercises in the preceding chapter. Envision each character in a highly stressful situation: a robbery, a violent fight, an accident with a loved one, the need to end medical treatment for a terminally ill spouse or child or parent. How do they respond? Take your time; let the scene develop organically. 
2. For each of the same characters used for exercise 1, answer these questions: 
	1. What is the character’s core desire? How have previous attempts to gratify that desire been thwarted? Is there a single character who epitomizes the frustration of that unfulfilled desire? How does the ghost of the past revisit the character in the time of your story? What forms do his adaptations or defenses take? At what level is he stuck? 
	2. Is there a galvanic character in the present who serves as a revenant, someone who forces the main character to deal with his continuing inability to act honestly, bravely, responsibly?

### Chapter Seven - The Power of Wounds: Vulnerability 
#### Exercises - The Power of Wounds: Vulnerability
1. As before, select three characters from a piece you’re currently writing. Do any of them exhibit: A physical vulnerability—a wound, an illness, a disfiguring scar? A situational one—what threat(s) do they face in your story? A moral one—what sort of guilt are they risking due to the actions they commit? If none of these applies, supply one kind of vulnerability and see what happens. 
2. Once the three characters addressed in exercise 1 possess a vulnerability, identify what other characters in the story are drawn in because of that. Does the wounded character come to rely on the help of one of these other characters? How does that need for help play out? (For example, is there a successful outcome?) Or is the character betrayed or abandoned by his helper? Does the character, out of shame, blame himself for that betrayal or abandonment? 
3. Taking these same three characters: Do they believe they are worthy of love? If so, what person or persons in their past convinced them of this, and how and when did that happen? What elements of unworthiness persist, and what incidents and people are responsible? Picture the moments specifically; play them out as scenes. 
4. Again, the same three characters: When was the last time they were truly open with someone? How did it turn out?
### Chapter Eight - The Gravity of the Hidden: Secrets 
#### Exercises - The Gravity of the Hidden: Secrets

1. Take three characters from a piece you’re currently writing and identify whether they possess any secrets. If so, how do those secrets affect their behavior vis-à-vis the other characters? Are any of the characters actively trying to unearth another’s secret? Why or why not? What would happen if one character were to disclose her secret to one of the other characters? (If nothing, choose a more damning, shameful, or devastating secret.)
   
2. Analyze the secrets you developed in your response to exercise 1. How long has the character been hiding this secret? How habitual is the concealment? Has that concealment become second nature? If so, what might force it back into consciousness?

3. For any of the characters you explored in the previous two exercises, does a secret form the ghost of the story? If so, who serves as revenant, to expose the ghost and force the main character to deal with bringing it into the open?
### Chapter Nine - The Paradox of This but That: Contradictions
#### Exercises - The Paradox of This but That: Contradictions
1. Select three characters from a work of fiction or film you’ve recently enjoyed and ask if they exhibit any of the following contradictions:
	1. Physical, ironic, or comic juxtaposition 
	2. Need to serve multiple social roles 
	3. Competing morals or goals 
	4. A secret or deceit 
	5. Conscious versus unconscious traits 
	6. Dispositional or constitutional contradictions 
2. Do the same for three characters taken from a piece you’re currently working on. 
3. If a character chosen for exercises 1 and 2 does not possess a contradiction, supply one. What happens? Does it feel contrived or organic? In either case, why?
### Chapter Ten - Serving and Defying the Tyranny of Motive
#### Exercises - Serving and Defying the Tyranny of Motive
1. Go back to a novel or film you’ve enjoyed recently. Take three characters from it and analyze a particularly key action each of them makes within the story. Ask yourself if there is a single identifiable motive for any of these actions, or whether there is instead a complex of factors prompting the action. Don’t be vague—tease out those multiple factors. 
2. Repeat the above exercise with two characters from a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Envision what would happen if the two characters from exercise 2 did exactly the opposite of what you’ve already written in the scenes you’ve chosen. Does that reversal violate or enhance your sense of what the character is capable of? If it feels wrong or forced, examine what causes this—is it possible, for example, that your sense of the character is needlessly limited?

#### Exercises - Flesh and Blood and Shoes: The Characters Physical Nature
1. Take a piece on which you are currently working and reflect on what would happen if you changed the sex, race, or age of one or more of its major characters. Has anything become possible or impossible with the change? If so, why? 
2. Using the same piece as chosen for exercise 1, imagine one or more main characters fumbling through an act of terribly unsatisfying sex (don’t make it solely the other character’s fault). Do you learn anything about your character? Why or why not? 
3. Taking these same characters, ask how their ages influence the way they view the world and interact with others. 
4. How do the characters chosen for the preceding exercises feel about their sexual allure? Do they feel comfortable in their own skin? Is their self-image consistent with an objective appraisal of their sex appeal? If not, why? 
5. Using the same characters, explore the issue of health: Have they ever been mortally ill? When? Have the effects of this illness lingered in some way? What if one or another of them were to suddenly become ill? Who would care for them? How would the character respond to that helplessness? 
6. For the same characters, explore their fashion sense and deportment. Put them in uncomfortable or out-of-the-ordinary clothes. How does their behavior change?

### Chapter Thirteen - The Tempest Within: The Character's Psychological Nature
#### Exercises - The Tempest Within: The Character's Psychological Nature
1. Take two characters from a piece on which you are currently working and explore as discussed in this chapter each of the following psychological components of their makeup:
	1. Desire 
	2. Fear 
	3. Courage 
	4. Love 
	5. Hate 
	6. Shame 
	7. Guilt 
	8. Forgiveness 
	9. Failure 
	10. Success/Pride 
	11. Religion/Spirituality 
	12. Food 
	13. Death 
2. Has this work inspired any additional scenes, or suggested changes in scenes you’ve already written? If so, how? If not, why?

### Chapter Fourteen - The Teeming World: The Character's Sociological Nature

#### Exercises - The Teeming World
1. Take two characters from a piece you’re currently writing and explore as discussed in this chapter each of the following sociological relationships or areas of social engagement

Family 
	(a) Father 
	(b) Mother 
	(c) Grandparents 
	(d) Siblings 
	(e) Children 
	(f) Spouse 
Friends 
Name 
Class 
Work 
Education 
Geography 
Home 
“Tribe” 

Has this work inspired any additional scenes, or suggested changes in scenes you’ve already written. If so, how? If not, why?

### Chapter Fifteen - Picking a Fight: Politics
#### Picking a Fight: Politics
1. Take two characters without any overt political affiliation from a book or film or TV program you’ve enjoyed. Look at how they address issues such as initiative, responsibility, discipline, danger, authority, communication, self-fulfillment, fairness. Can you discern a political inclination even though none is stated? Why or why not? 
2. In the same way as in exercise 1, explore the politics of the characters in a piece you’ve recently written. Did you unwittingly make them all vaguely of the same political stripe? What would happen if you changed one of the left-leaning characters rightward, or vice versa? 
3. Craft a character whose political convictions oppose your own. How successful is the result? Don’t decide for yourself; let others read the work and judge for themselves.

### Chapter Sixteen - Quirks ,Tics, and Bad Habits
#### Quirks, Tics, and Bad Habits
1. Take a trip to any local spot where a variety of people mingle. Make notes of intriguing, odd, or vivid touches of seemingly inadvertent behavior. Then take two characters from a piece you’re working on and add one of these quirks, tics, or mindless habits to each. Does it feel organic or simply slathered on? What could you do to make it feel more natural? 
2. Do the same with another two characters, this time using one of the examples discussed in this chapter or one of the interrogative prompts. Again—does the result enhance the characterization or feel forced? How can you tell?

## Part 3 - Roles
### Chapter Seventeen - Meaning and Its Messenger: The Protagonist and the Premise
#### Exercises - Meaning and Its Messenger: The Protagonist and the Premise
1. Take three films or books you especially prize and identify the main characters. Who if any of them stands out as the protagonist? Why? What’s at stake for him or her? 
2. Do the same as in exercise 1 for a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Take three films or books you especially prize and try to discern the premise in each. Formulate it first as an abstract conjecture with a moral cause and an action, with either one good prevailing over another, a virtue overcoming a vice, or a vice defeating a virtue. Next, with these same three sources, outline the ways of life that are in opposition in the story. What does the protagonist consider the good life at the beginning of the story? What does he recognize as the good life at the end? What’s happened in between? If there’s an opponent or villain, what way of life is he defending or trying to preserve? Last, formulate the premises in terms of the individual characters themselves, their wants, their moral convictions, their struggles, their adversaries. Which formulation of the premise feels most natural to you? Which inspires you the most, engages you most? 
4. Do the same as in exercise 3 with a piece you’re currently writing. Which formulation of the premise feels not just most natural, but lends itself most readily to your work, returns you to the desire to write? 
5. Draw up a list of ten scenes from books or films that have moved you deeply. Identify what it is in each scene that you find so compelling. Do you detect in some of these scenes a certain thread of thematic similarity? Can you identify a set of personal themes you can use to guide your own writing?
### Chapter Eighteen - The Challenge of Change: Three Protagonist Questions
#### Exercises - What do I Have to Change About Myself to Get What I Want?
1. Take three films or books you especially prize and identify the main characters. Who if any of them stands out as the protagonist? Why? What’s at stake for him or her? 
2. Do the same as in exercise 1 for a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Take three films or books you especially prize and try to discern the premise in each. Formulate it first as an abstract conjecture with a moral cause and an action, with either one good prevailing over another, a virtue overcoming a vice, or a vice defeating a virtue. Next, with these same three sources, outline the ways of life that are in opposition in the story. What does the protagonist consider the good life at the beginning of the story? What does he recognize as the good life at the end? What’s happened in between? If there’s an opponent or villain, what way of life is he defending or trying to preserve? Last, formulate the premises in terms of the individual characters themselves, their wants, their moral convictions, their struggles, their adversaries. Which formulation of the premise feels most natural to you? Which inspires you the most, engages you most? 
4. Do the same as in exercise 3 with a piece you’re currently writing. Which formulation of the premise feels not just most natural, but lends itself most readily to your work, returns you to the desire to write? 
5. Draw up a list of ten scenes from books or films that have moved you deeply. Identify what it is in each scene that you find so compelling. Do you detect in some of these scenes a certain thread of thematic similarity? Can you identify a set of personal themes you can use to guide your own writing?

### Chapter Nineteen - Ciphers, Stiffs, and Sleepwalkers: Protagonist Problems 
#### Exercises - When the Narrator and Protagonist Differ, but Both are Characters in the Story

1. Return to the three protagonists you selected in response to exercise 1 in chapter 17. What risks does the protagonist take to achieve her main objective? Does her behavior, motivation, or resolve change as the conflict intensifies? How? 
2. In these same three examples, are any of the protagonists unaware, unclear, or frightened of their true desires at the outset of the story? When does their awareness crystallize? What action obliges that recognition? What is the dramatic effect of that insight
3. Take an event from your own life and dramatize it, with the protagonist based on yourself. What personal flaws, shortcomings, or limitations do you find most difficult to portray? How does the story require them? (If the event you’ve chosen doesn’t require depiction of a personal flaw or shortcoming, choose another.) Pay close attention to the feeling that arises as you discern the shortcomings in the character based on yourself: Are there any other characters you’ve created that have affected you in a similar way? Can you think of ways to improve their depiction now that you recognize their similarity to you? 
4. Consider a story with multiple main characters or story lines. Is there a character who provides the principal focus to the story—i.e., who effectively serves as protagonist? How can you tell? What happens in the climax of the story? Who is present? Who is most profoundly affected? What happens to the other characters in the climax and the denouement? 
5. Consider a story in which the narrator differs from the protagonist but also takes part in the action of the story. Does the focus of the story shift from narrator to protagonist at any time? Does this cause a division of sympathy, or a diffusion of dramatic effect? Why or why not?

### Chapter Twenty The Character of Conflict: The Opponent
#### Exercises - Can the Opponent Change?
1. Choose three novels or films with a clear-cut opponent. What are the qualities that spare him from being, to quote Conrad, “quite so black”? Does he change? 
2. Using the same examples, does he have stand-ins, proxies, underlings that do his bidding before his appearance in the story? How does the character of each of these surrogates compare or contrast with that of the opponent? How does any such contrast create suspense or surprise within the story? Ask these same questions of the opponent in a piece you’re currently writing.
### Chapter Twenty-one - The Army of Others: Secondary Characters
#### Exercises - The Village
1. Return to the novels or films you selected for the exercises in the previous two chapters on the protagonist and the opponent. Identify the most significant secondary characters: Is there a ghost—a character in the protagonist’s backstory still exerting some troubling influence over the protagonist? Is there a revenant forcing the protagonist to deal with that influence in a positive way or to resolve the conflict it creates? Is there a counterweight character in the present time of the story impeding the protagonist’s efforts at insight or change? How do these characters help the protagonist confront or resolve his inner conflicts? Analyze how this gets dramatized in specific scenes. What moments of agreement or discord externalize those conflicts and allow the protagonist to focus on them? Are there any crucial allies? What specific form do they take: Mentor? Love interest? Sidekick? Expert? Confidant? Faithful servant? Do they also serve as revenant? Again, analyze how these characters in specific scenes assist the protagonist or opponent in pursuing their goals, then help flesh out the complexity of the plan each has undertaken.
2. Ask the same questions as in exercise 1 for a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Go through your bookshelf and your own work and find examples of each of the following types of secondary character: The Betrayer The Sympathetic Heavy The Visitor The Stranger As before, with each example, analyze the scenes they share with the protagonist or opponent for how the main character’s emotional complexity and depth is revealed, explored, and developed through their interactions with these characters. 
4. In the works you selected for the previous three exercises, identify the most significant secondary characters beyond those already addressed in the previous exercises, and analyze how, in specific exchanges, they help flesh out the protagonist’s and opponent’s distinct ways of life. What would be lost if any of them were eliminated? 
5. Return to the work you did in chapters 13 and 14 on the character’s psychological and sociological nature. How did this work provide you with suggestions for necessary secondary characters? Which roles did those secondary characters assume? Which possible characters fell by the wayside? Why?

## Part 4 - Technique

### Chapter Twenty-two - The Clash of Character: Scenes
#### Exercises - Balancing Action and Inner Life
1. Take a scene from a novel or film you’ve recently enjoyed and break it down: What are the objective, obstacle, and action for each major character in the scene? What are the setup, turning point, and payoff for the scene? 
2. Do the same as in exercise 1 for a scene from a piece you’re currently writing. 
3. Consult a novel you’ve recently enjoyed and try to find a section that appears to be composed solely of a character’s thoughts or feelings. Go back to the preceding scene and try to discern how its dramatic events led to the more descriptive section. In particular, does the passage provide an emotional response to the preceding action, or an analysis of options, or both? Is there a movement toward a decision or a change of heart in the character’s reflections? 
4. Taking the same novel or film chosen for exercise 1, can you identify any characters who embody or help externalize an inner conflict in the protagonist? 
5. Again, taking the same novel or film chosen for exercise 1, find a section where inner life is contrasted with outer action. How is this accomplished? How well does it work—i.e., what is learned about the character from this contrast?

### Chapter Twenty-three - The Personal Perspective: Point of View
#### Exercises - Point of View in Film and TV
1. Take three novels and ask the three key questions addressed at the outset of this chapter: Why is this story being told? Who has authority to tell it? What effect does the point of view achieve? How would the story be different if told from a different point of view? 
2. Take a self-contained section from a piece you’re currently writing and again ask those same three key questions. Have you chosen the point-of-view character wisely? Who else might step forward and assume that role? How does that change alter the quality of the telling? What events are now difficult or impossible to narrate because the point-of-view character isn’t in them? 
3. Using the same work in progress as for exercise 2, change the point of view from third to first, or vice versa. What has changed? Does the difference improve anything, dull an effect, enhance it, create greater or lesser intimacy with the point-of-view character, evoke naturalness in the telling?
4. Take a section from a first-person story or novel and look for transitions from subjective to objective modality, or vice versa. How does the transition work, what is the tonal effect of the movement, how does the language change, if at all? Does it feel convincing or leave you puzzled? In either case, why? Do the same for a story or novel section in the third person. 
5. Compare your results from exercise 4 for first and third person. Did you notice any particular difference in how transitions were handled? What were they? How did the distinct approaches to transition underscore the advantages or limitations of the point of view used? 
6. Take a novel in the omniscient point of view—Tess of the d’Urbervilles, by Thomas Hardy, for example, or Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, or Ann Patchett’s Bel Canto—and locate those sections that most conspicuously feel “omniscient,” i.e., from the point of view of an all-knowing intelligence. How unique or characteristic is the voice? How distinct is that voice from those of the characters? How could the omniscient point of view be rewritten as multiple third person? What would you miss? 
7. Take a film or TV script and analyze its first five scenes from the perspective of point of view. How many points of view are there? Are there too many? Does the focus seem scattered or simply ambitious? What are the various ways point of view is established in the scenes--i.e., how do you know which character is the central focus of the scene?

### Chapter Twenty-four - Language as Attitude: Voice
#### Exercises - Voice in the Portrayal of Character
1. Who would you identify as your ideal reader if you were hoping to feel inspired to do your best work? Your father? Your favorite teacher? A friend you trust? A writer you admire? A statesman you revere? Christ? Satan? 
2. What five works would you choose to copy if you were to follow James Frey’s advice and copy out the text for a half hour each morning? 
3. Review those five books for how voice is controlled to establish character. What distinguishes the voice of each character? The style of their word choice? The musicality and rhythm of their diction? The specific beliefs and fears that comprise their worldview? The snarl or song in their attitude? 
4. Do the same for a piece you’re currently working on. Assess your characters in terms of style, worldview, attitude. What could you do to enhance their characterization and to distinguish one from the other? How could you give them an “attitude adjustment” and enhance their distinctiveness?

### Chapter Twenty-five - Word as Deed: Dialog 
#### Exercises - Creating Variety Among Characters
1. Take a section of dialog that you particularly admire from a book that has influenced you as a writer. Break down the scene in terms of each character’s objective, obstacle, and the various adjustments he employs to circumvent or overcome the obstacle and continue pursuing his objective. How does the character’s dialog reflect the objective, obstacle, and adjustments? How is his attitude reflected in the dialog? What elements of fear, joy, shame, guilt, pride, sorrow, or other emotional states come out during the scene? What elements of the character’s backstory does the dialog reveal? How are his educational level, regional background, economic station, moral or political disposition, work or profession, community or church expressed in his dialog? 
2. Do the same sort of breakdown analysis for a scene you’re currently writing. 
3. Take the same scene as in exercise 2 and use at least three of the techniques for enhancing realism in the dialog. How did you get the technique to conform to each character’s objective? How did that change the dynamic of the scene or the portrayal of the characters? 
4. Take a longer section of dialog you’ve written and remove all the speech tags. Are the speakers still readily identifiable? If not, how could you use beats, setting, or description instead of speech tags to solve this problem? 
5. Take a multicharacter dialog scene from a book or script and analyze what distinct vocal and attitude mannerisms are used to identify and render unique each individual.



**Every work of fiction explores four key questions: Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going? What does it mean? These questions apply not just to your characters. They apply to you. And the exploration is ongoing.**
