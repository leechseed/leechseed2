# Introduction
## THE METHODOLOGY OF THIS BOOK--MOTIVATION AS THE COMPAS OF CHARACTER
### Chapter Summary: Character Motivation as the Compass

**Key Concept:** The core of every character in storytelling is their motivation—what they desire and the lengths they'll go to achieve it. This motivation should be deeply rooted in their personality and experiences.

**Main Points:**

1. **The Quintessential Question:** The heart of every character lies in answering the question, "What does she want?" This simple inquiry, however, can be deceptively complex to address, with nuances, layers, and dimensions to explore.
   
2. **Complexities and Exceptions:** Not all characters openly reveal their desires. Examples like Holden Caulfield in "The Catcher in the Rye" or the cast of Harold Pinter's "The Homecoming" highlight that motivations can be obscured or deeply buried. Moreover, people often misunderstand or are unaware of their real desires.
   
3. **Avoiding Oversimplification:** While it's essential to understand a character's wants, reducing them to just a singular goal can lead to superficial and unsatisfying results. Characters should be multifaceted, reflecting real human complexity.
   
4. **The Art of Character:** Characters should remain somewhat unpredictable to keep readers engaged. Their actions should stem from their entire personality, including their past, desires, relationships, and experiences. Over-explanation can kill the depth and intrigue of a character.
   
5. **Methodology Presented:**
   - Characters are torn between two impulses: seeking life's promises and shielding themselves from its pains.
   - Everyone has hidden strengths and weaknesses, only revealed under certain circumstances.
   - Characterization focuses on deep-rooted needs, internal and external conflicts, and the continuous search for self-identity.
   
6. **Breaking Down Desire:** The question of a character's desire can be segmented into four elements:
   - Lack
   - Yearning
   - Resistance (consisting of weaknesses, external oppositions, moral flaws)
   - Desire
   
7. **Compass of Character:** This concept suggests that characters, like real people, have an innate sense of when they're true to themselves. This compass can be influenced, for better or worse, by various internal and external factors. Following this compass can lead to fulfillment, but the journey is riddled with diversions and challenges.

**Conclusion:** By understanding the deep-seated motivations of characters and treating them as multifaceted entities, writers can craft compelling narratives that resonate with readers. The journey of a character, both internally and externally, defines their story, and understanding their "compass" helps guide this journey.
## RECENT TRENDS IN STORYTELLING REQUIRE COMPLEX MOTIVATION
### Summary: The Need for Complex Character Development in Modern Storytelling

**Primary Insight:** Modern storytelling trends necessitate in-depth, evolving character arcs, making sophisticated characterization vital across genres and mediums.

**Main Observations:**

1. **Current Trends in Storytelling:**
   - The shift to **long-format TV series** necessitates multi-season character arcs.
   - **Fantasy genre series**, bolstered by successes like George R. R. Martin’s "A Song of Ice and Fire" (which inspired "Game of Thrones"), require characters with expansive development.
   - **Crime genre trends** are now focused on characters that not only reappear but also evolve throughout the series.

2. **Need for Sophisticated Characterization:**
   - It's not just literary fiction that demands intricate characterizations. All forms of fiction, regardless of their medium, need well-developed characters.
   - Character development shouldn't be about adding more layers arbitrarily but should stem from a solid foundation that allows for growth, transformation, and the unexpected.
   
3. **Universal Desire for Meaning:**
   - Characters, mirroring human nature, are driven by a desire to understand their existence, to give their lives purpose, and to make their actions impactful, especially in the face of inevitable mortality.
   - This quest for purpose and understanding signals a profound desire for clarity about identity and the correct path in life.

4. **Character as a Compass:**
   - Just as humans need guidance in their search for meaning, characters require a 'compass'—an intrinsic motivation or guiding force.
   - This book aims to help writers craft this compass for their characters, breathing life into them and making them resonate with readers or viewers.

**Conclusion:** With the rise of extended storytelling arcs across various genres and mediums, the demand for multifaceted characters has never been higher. This book seeks to guide writers in developing characters with depth, anchored by a strong internal compass, enabling them to navigate complex narrative landscapes.
# Part One - Developing a Technique 
## 1 The Logic of Longing 
#### Summary: The Complexities of Character Desire in Storytelling

**Core Principle:** To create compelling characters, writers must ground their complexities in coherent simplicity, ensuring their intricate layers retain a genuine elegance and truth.

**Main Points:**

1. **Desire in Storytelling:** 
   - Desire propels the narrative. It has different levels and facets.
   - **Distinction of Terms:** 
     - **Desire:** A character's intentional pursuit of a goal, which could be internal (self-improvement), interpersonal (relationship goals), or external (objective tasks). External goals often intertwine with internal and interpersonal dynamics.
     - **Yearning:** The deeper emotional need explaining why a character is driven towards a goal. It relates to their core identity and their ideal life vision.

2. **The Four Key Elements of Character Development:** 
   - **Lack:** Characters start with an unmet need or dissatisfaction in life, often failing to meet their own expectations, ambitions, or dreams.
   - **Yearning:** Originates from the character's vision of an ideal life and who they desire to become. It can range from noble pursuits to darker visions.
   - **Resistance:** Obstacles preventing the character's Yearning from being realized. It could be internal, like emotional wounds, or external, such as opposition from others.
   - **Desire:** Triggered by a significant event, characters act on a desire to change or respond to their circumstances. It's essential to link this desire to their underlying Yearning.

3. **Interplay Among Levels:** 
   - Characters often begin in a state of **Lack**, feeling they are not living up to their potential or are dissatisfied with their current state.
   - This lack stems from an unfulfilled **Yearning**, a vision of their ideal self or life.
   - Their Yearning remains unrealized due to **Resistance**, either from internal fears or external opposition.
   - A significant event catalyzes their **Desire** to take action, intertwining with their Yearning.

4. **Understanding Resistance:** 
   - It can be multifaceted:
     - **Weaknesses:** Personal shortcomings like laziness or despair.
     - **Wounds:** Past traumas hindering growth.
     - **Limitations:** Inherent challenges, e.g., age or poverty.
     - **Opposition:** External forces working against the character's goals.
     - **Flaws:** Negative character traits such as selfishness or deceit.
   - All these elements often work together, influencing and intensifying a character's journey.

**Conclusion:** For a story to be gripping, a character's Desire and Yearning should be deeply intertwined, revealing both the reasons behind their actions and the stakes involved. By understanding and exploring these layers, writers can craft multifaceted characters that captivate readers.
### A WORD OF CAUTION CONCERING TERMINOLOGY
#### Summary: Understanding Character Elements in Storytelling

**Introduction:** The terms used to describe character elements—Lack, Yearning, Resistance, Desire—may unintentionally convey the notion that these are tangible objects, even if they are spiritual, psychological, or emotional in nature.

**Main Points:**

1. **Idealism vs. Practicality:** 
   - For idealists, or those believing in the human soul or Plato's concept of ideal forms, these terms may fit naturally.
   - However, for realists or those skeptical about the existence of abstract entities like the soul or fate, these terms might appear too idealistic.

2. **Alternative Conceptualization:** 
   - Instead of viewing these elements as concrete objects:
     - **Lack** can be seen as a character's mental state or attitude (e.g., contentment, boredom).
     - **Yearning, Resistance, and Desire** can be considered as impulses or reactions, rather than fixed states.
   
3. **Fluidity in Character Elements:** 
   - Characters can be misguided about their goals or feelings, suggesting that these elements are not rigid but dynamic.
   - One can envision them either as concrete entities influencing characters, akin to planets with gravitational pull, or as fluid forces guiding their emotions and actions.

4. **Fundamentality of these Elements:** 
   - Regardless of how one perceives them, Lack, Yearning, Resistance, and Desire are inherent parts of human existence.
   - They reflect the intrinsic aspects of our lives, similar to basic needs like breathing or feeling hunger.

**Conclusion:** Writers have the freedom to choose how they interpret and employ these character elements in their storytelling. While some might prefer a concrete representation, others might opt for a more fluid understanding, capturing the inherent uncertainties of human life. The choice ultimately aligns with one's storytelling approach and personal philosophy.
## 2 The Hole at the Heart of the Matter--Lack 

### I. THE ECHO IN THE EMPTY ROOM
#### Summary: The Concept of Lack in Human Existence

**Main Idea:** Every individual, regardless of their achievements or societal status, feels a sense of incompleteness or that something is missing from their lives. This inner void is a universal sentiment and is integral to the human psyche.

**Key Points:**

1. **Universal Acceptance:** Various religious, philosophical, and psychological traditions acknowledge this inner void:
   - **Plato** believed the soul yearns to connect with pure Truth but often remains confined due to false beliefs.
   - **Aristotle** posited that humans aim to live rationally to achieve their individual destiny, termed "eudaimonia."
   - **Augustine** attributed this Lack to original sin, causing humans to be in exile from a state of divine vision.
   - **Hinduism** portrays the soul as trapped in a cycle of reincarnation, longing for liberation through unification with the universal reality.
   - **Buddhism** perceives the Lack as a result of recognizing the non-self or absence of individual identity, leading to an inevitable chase for materialistic desires.
   - Philosophies like **Confucianism**, **Stoicism**, and **Epicureanism** highlight the imbalance in life, suggesting there's an inherent sense of disharmony in existence.
   - **Emerson** and **Nietzsche** emphasized the potential for self-transformation and the creation of one's own values, respectively.
   - The **American Pragmatist tradition** perceives life as continuous evolution towards an uncertain future.
   - **Heidegger** associated anxiety as a cornerstone of our existence due to our inability to find absolute truth.
   - Psychoanalysts like **Freud** and **Adler** viewed neurosis as the inherent human condition, while **Jung** saw humans as divided between conscious and unconscious minds, needing integration.

2. **Categorization of Incompleteness:**
   - One perspective views Lack as resulting from our unmet Yearnings, suggesting that our lives feel incomplete because of an unachieved ideal state.
   - An alternative view considers Lack as inherent, born out of intrinsic feelings of inadequacy and confusion. Our Yearnings arise from this inherent Lack as we seek an escape from our inherent anxieties.

3. **Relationship between Lack and Yearning:** The link between Lack and Yearning can be perceived as cause-and-effect, where either can be the cause or the effect based on an individual's stage in life, challenges faced, or other circumstances. This interrelation will be further discussed in the context of Yearning in subsequent discussions.

**Conclusion:** The sensation of Lack, whether arising from unmet Yearnings or inherent inadequacies, is an essential aspect of human nature and deeply ingrained in various cultural, philosophical, and religious narratives.

### II. PROJECTION AND CONTENTMENT—HOW LACK REVEALS ITSELF IN SIMPLE CHARACTERS
#### Summary: Character Types and Their Internal Dynamics in Fiction

**Main Idea:** The text discusses three distinct character archetypes in literature – the "Traveling Angel", the "Contented Character", and the "Sadder-but-Wiser Character" – emphasizing the internal conflicts, motivations, and their role in storytelling.

**1. The Simple (or Flat/Transparent) Character:**
   - These characters, though seemingly simple, possess depth, internal conflicts, and motivations.
   - Their inner struggles might be downplayed, often driven by external circumstances rather than internal compulsions.
   - They might either be content or have accepted their world and themselves.

**2. The Traveling Angel:**
   - Descends from archetypes like the knight errant or wandering bard.
   - These characters move from place to place, resolving issues with unique skills before leaving.
   - Examples include detectives like Hercule Poirot, samurais, or figures like Mary Poppins.
   - Their driving "Lack" often arises from compassion or a sense of justice, pushing them to right wrongs.
   - While they have a clear sense of identity and purpose, they can still feel emotions like loneliness or regret.
   - Their internal struggles usually remain unchanged by the story's events; they help others and then leave.

**3. The Contented Character:**
   - These characters live in a state of relative tranquility and feel largely fulfilled.
   - For them to be engaging protagonists, an external force must disrupt their peace, requiring them to find a new equilibrium.
   - The story can involve this character's happiness being tested by external threats, or a realization that their contentment was based on a misunderstanding.
   - By the end, these characters may need new skills or a revised worldview to address the disruption.

**4. The Sadder-but-Wiser Character:**
   - These characters have attained tranquility after enduring significant hardships and have accepted life's imperfections.
   - Their state of well-being has been hard-won, leading to a more profound understanding of life.
   - In stories, their past might resurface, demanding them to confront and address past issues.
   - Often found in mentor roles, these characters possess a deep awareness of life’s tragic dimension and the costs associated with virtues.

**Conclusion:** Whether a character is roaming to solve issues, contentedly navigating life, or exuding wisdom from past hardships, each archetype has its unique intricacies and roles in storytelling. By understanding these nuances, writers can create compelling narratives and drive their story forward.

### III. URGENCY, ANXIETY, AND DENIAL—HOW LACK REVEALS ITSELF IN MORE COMPLEX CHARACTERS
### Summary: Character's Sense of "Lack" in Storytelling

**Main Idea:** The text delves into the idea of "Lack" or the yearning and sense of something missing in a character's life, a common theme in literature. It explores how characters grapple with this absence, their behaviors in reaction to it, and how writers can effectively portray it.

**1. The Problem of Yearning and Lack:**
   - Acknowledging this lack reveals a character's shortcomings and the unfulfilled aspects of their life.
   - Many people avoid recognizing what they genuinely want from life, leading to "lives of quiet desperation" as Thoreau described.

**2. Portraying Absence:**
   - The challenge for writers is to depict not the absence directly but its effect on the character and how they try to cope, deny, or dismiss it.

**3. Characters Aware of Their Lack:**
   - *Examples:* In love stories, like "Romeo and Juliet," characters quickly realize what they yearn for. In others like "Oedipus Rex" and "Moby-Dick," protagonists have an urgent need driven by their misconceptions about their inner emptiness.
   - These characters try to address their sense of lack using misguided means, leading to a learning journey throughout the story.

**4. Anxiety: A Hint that Something is Amiss:**
   - Some characters are unclear about what's missing and only gain this understanding as the story unfolds.
   - They might feel restless, angry, or indifferent, expressing a lack of purpose or direction, like Holden Caulfield in "The Catcher in the Rye."

**5. Denial as a Coping Mechanism:**
   - Some characters live in denial, protecting themselves from confronting their sense of lack.
   - This can manifest as:
      - Psychic numbness, sometimes aided by substances.
      - Cheerful ignorance.
      - Following external belief systems to drown inner doubts.
      - Distracting oneself with life's activities to avoid confronting the emptiness.

**Conclusion:** Characters' attitudes and reactions to their daily life, interactions with others, and their self-perception are key indicators of their underlying sense of "Lack," even if they aren't directly aware of it. By exploring these dimensions, writers can convey a depth and authenticity in their characters, resonating with the universal human experience of yearning and the quest for fulfillment.
### IV. THE SPECIAL CASE OF LACK INDUCED BY TRAUMA OR TRAGIC LOSS

#### Summary: Lack Induced by Trauma or Tragic Loss

**Main Concept:** The chapter discusses characters who experience profound emptiness or "Lack" due to severe trauma or a tragic event. This trauma creates a long-lasting impact, often altering their perception of the world and their place in it.

**Key Points:**

1. **Nature of the Trauma:**
   - Characters could have experienced rape, torture, severe psychological or sexual abuse.
   - They could be survivors of disasters, accidents, or wars.
   - Personal experiences like prolonged illness, especially if they watched a loved one suffer, can also induce trauma.

2. **Symptoms of Trauma:**
   - Often, such characters live with fear, feeling isolated and alone.
   - They might face insomnia plagued by nightmares, or even resort to substance abuse to numb the pain.
   - This persistent fear and state of alertness is termed as PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), usually initiated by incidents that instill deep fear and shame.

3. **Moral Injury:**
   - A related disorder is Moral Injury, often found in those who've been in situations where the boundaries between combatants and civilians are blurred.
   - It's also seen in people like police officers, journalists, or aid workers who have been part of, witnessed, or heard about atrocities or incidents that shake their moral foundation.
   - The trauma here isn't fear-based, but it's an offense to one's conscience, questioning their understanding of morality, justice, and humanity.

4. **Yearning after Trauma:**
   - For characters suffering from PTSD or Moral Injury, their previous dreams or "Yearning" often seem distant and irrelevant.
   - They don’t long for extravagant dreams but yearn for basic feelings like normalcy, safety, justice, and humanity.
   - A simple, peaceful life becomes their profound aspiration.

5. **Historical Reference:**
   - Though the terms are modern, such characters have been depicted historically.
   - George Eliot’s "Silas Marner" portrays a character who, after facing repeated betrayals and accusations, retreats into isolation, finding solace only in his earnings.
   - Russell Banks’ short story "Lobster Night" tells of Stacy, a skier with Olympic dreams whose life changed after being struck by lightning, living with the constant fear of it happening again.

**Conclusion:** Trauma, whether from personal incidents or moral conflicts, can fundamentally shift a character's dreams and desires. Instead of grand ambitions, they often yearn for basic human experiences, emphasizing the profound impact trauma has on the human psyche.

### V. WHEN THE CHARACTER’S OBLIVION TO HIS LACK IS ABSOLUTE
#### Summary: When a Character is Completely Oblivious to their Lack

**Main Point:** This section discusses characters who are entirely unaware of the void or "Lack" in their lives. Such characters can either be in vehement denial, have a personality disorder, or be in complete oblivion. Their ability to recognize and confront their lack has implications for their role in the story.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Whistling Past the Graveyard:** 
    - Some characters superficially ignore their anxiety or lack, trying to suppress or wish it away. They have some faint recognition of their void but deny it.
   
2. **Oblivious Characters in Literature:** 
    - Examples include characters from James Joyce’s “Two Gallants”, Flannery O’Connor’s “The Barber”, and James Lee Burke’s “Wayfaring Stranger”. Such characters sometimes play the role of the Fool, either being benevolent or bothersome.

3. **Reasons for Such Behavior:**
    - **Vehement Denial:** The character denies their lack so strongly that they project their issues onto the outside world. To evolve, they need a significant event in the story to recognize their lack.
    - **Personality Disorder:** Characters may be constitutionally unaware of their lack due to disorders like narcissism or simple ignorance. They might not change unless faced with a significant disaster.
    - **Complete Oblivion:** Some characters are just unaware, without any reason for their behavior.

4. **Role in the Story:** 
    - The character's reason for obliviousness determines their role:
        - If in vehement denial, they could be the protagonist who eventually recognizes and confronts their lack.
        - If due to a personality disorder, they may not change unless there's a major event. They might not make the best protagonists.
        - If they're entirely oblivious, they may influence change in others, like Chance in "Being There", without changing themselves. They're likely secondary characters or opponents.
        
**Conclusion:** When crafting a character who seems unaware of their void or lack, it's vital to understand why they behave this way. This reason will guide their journey in the story and determine whether they're a protagonist, opponent, or a secondary character.
### VI. SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER’S LACK
#### Summary: Symbolic Representation of a Character's Lack

**Concept:** Characters' inner voids or "Lacks" can be symbolically portrayed in narratives. These symbols serve to externally represent internal feelings, desires, or voids. They can be used throughout the story, helping to track the character's progression or stagnation.

**Examples of Symbolic Representations:**
1. **Hester Prynne’s scarlet letter** in "The Scarlet Letter": Symbolizes both the society's hypocrisy that condemns her and her defiance against that society.
  
2. **The green light** in "The Great Gatsby": Represents Gatsby’s unrequited love for Daisy and his longing for social legitimacy.

3. **The ducks** in Tony Soprano’s pool in "The Sopranos": Symbolize his need for family – both his biological family and his mafia family.

4. **Blanche Dubois' lampshades** in "A Streetcar Named Desire": The scarves draped over the lampshades signify Blanche's fear of aging and the loss of her sexual allure, her means to power. By the end, the harsh lighting reflects her confrontation with cruel reality and her escape to madness.

5. **Walter White's initial humiliations** in "Breaking Bad": His mundane routines and humiliations represent his suppressed ambitions. As he becomes the drug lord Heisenberg, he symbolically breaks free from his previous constraints, claiming power and control.

**Alternative Symbolism**: A character’s Lack can also be depicted through a repetitive pattern of behavior introduced at the story's start. How they react to similar situations later on can reveal their growth or regression.

**Objective**: By introducing symbolic representations or patterns, writers can offer a layered understanding of characters' desires and struggles, providing a more enriching reading experience and highlighting the character’s development or lack thereof.
### SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN THIS CHAPTER 

#### Chapter Summary:

**Concept of Lack in Characters:**
1. **Definition of Lack:** A core human sensation where something feels absent from our lives. It can stem from:
   - An unfulfilled desire or "Yearning" that preexists our conscious recognition.
   - Innate feelings of inadequacy, dependence, and fear rooted in early life experiences.

2. **Character Classification Based on Lack:**
   - **Simple Characters:** Don’t possess intense feelings of Lack.
     * **Traveling Angels:** Characters who temporarily fix others' problems.
     * **Contented Characters:** Those content with their current status.
     * **Mature Characters:** Have undergone growth and now embody wisdom, often after enduring hardships.

   - **Complex Characters:** Exhibit their sense of Lack through behaviors and attitudes characterized by urgency, anxiety, or denial.

   - **Trauma-Afflicted Characters:** Have endured severe traumas, leading to an overwhelming sense of Lack, often overshadowing their core Yearnings.

   - **Characters Oblivious to Lack:** Fall under:
     * **Denial:** These characters can potentially be protagonists as their fierce denial might be a central plot point.
     * **No Insight:** Characters unaware of their Lack, making them unsuitable as protagonists due to their static nature.

3. **Symbolism and Habitual Behavior:** Effective storytelling techniques include symbolically representing a character's Lack or showcasing a recurring behavior pattern that highlights their way of coping with it.

The chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding and representing a character's internal void or Lack as a tool to deepen their characterization and advance the narrative.
## 3 The Heart of the Matter Itself--Yearning 

### I. THE PULSE OF STORY, THE SOURCE OF WILLFULNESS
#### Chapter Summary:

**Yearning: The Heartbeat of a Story**

1. **Introduction to Yearning:**
   - Yearning is central to dramatic portrayal. Understanding it can considerably enhance one's writing.
   - While "Lack" is the void in our lives, "Yearning" is the driving force to fill that void. It can be conceptualized as the aspiration to achieve one's dream or desired way of life.
   - It fuels a character's willfulness, determination, and perseverance.

2. **Nature of Yearning:**
   - It’s persistent and never truly satiated. It propels characters through their journeys and challenges, influencing their decisions to resist surrender or compromise.
   - Yearning outlines the stakes and significance of what a character desires, which gives meaning to their existence.

3. **Yearning as a "Secret":**
   - Robin Williams' perspective emphasizes that the heart of a character's portrayal is understanding their deepest secret or driving force.
   - This "secret" often remains hidden or unclear, even to the character themselves, especially at the start of a story.

4. **Broader Implications of Yearning:**
   - Yearning encompasses more than just seeking happiness. It relates to one's unique life purpose and how they align with it.
   - Yearning is not necessarily a force of good. It’s an impulse towards achieving a sense of self, combining various psychological elements. This journey can lead to both noble and savage paths.

5. **Origin and Continuity of Yearning:**
   - The source of Yearning is debated: Is it innate or developed through life experiences? Is it universal or unique to individuals?
   - Regardless of its origin, Yearning continuously influences us, pushing us towards a greater purpose. It's a consistent reminder of the incompleteness in our lives.

6. **Challenges with Yearning:**
   - Given its persistent and demanding nature, some might attempt to deny or ignore their Yearning. 
   - Yet, the echoes of unfulfilled Yearning can haunt one until the end of their days, leading either to acceptance or lingering regret.

In essence, Yearning is a crucial element in storytelling. It's the character’s internal drive, pushing them to face challenges and evolve. Recognizing and harnessing this element can provide depth and motivation to a character's journey.
### II. LACK AND YEARNING—CAUSE VS. EFFECT
#### Chapter Summary:

**Lack and Yearning – Cause vs. Effect**

- **Yearning's Unconscious Nature**: Yearning can be unconscious, similar to innate human needs like hunger or thirst. However, it becomes most influential when recognized.
- **Consciousness of Yearning**: Becoming aware of one's Yearning can happen suddenly, gradually, too late, or sometimes not at all. Those who never realize it typically aren't ideal protagonists unless the aim is comedy.
- **Lack and Yearning Interaction**: They can be seen as two aspects of a singular phenomenon – where Lack signifies a void, Yearning is the push to fill it. This relationship can be viewed in two ways:
    1. **Yearning as the Cause**: People feel incomplete because their lives are driven by a deeper destiny or truth they've yet to fulfill. Here, Lack is born from unfulfilled Yearning.
    2. **Lack as the Cause**: Incompleteness is our inherent nature, rooted in intrinsic feelings of inadequacy from early life. Here, Lack creates Yearning.
- **Countervailing Forces**: These two elements function as contrasting forces in our lives. Yearning as cause leans into life's promise, while Lack as cause is about evading life's pain.
- **Escape vs. Self-fulfillment**: Solely avoiding suffering may feel inadequate; therefore, deeper themes like identity, purpose, or connection should also be integrated.
- **Evolving Identity and Yearning**: Yearning nurtures an individual's identity, which is always evolving and seeking fulfillment. This sense of identity can be influenced by external factors, internal desires, and even disorders. However, it continually pushes towards achieving true happiness and self-realization.
### III. YEARNING AS A CALLING, SELF, SOUL, OR DESTINY
#### Chapter Summary:

**Yearning as an Innate Calling or Destiny**:

- Graham Greene's quote from "The Power and the Glory" suggests that there's a pivotal moment in childhood that sets the trajectory for one's future.
  
- **Yearning vs. Lack**: Lack can be seen as the outcome of an unfulfilled Yearning. Characters in stories often feel the weight of what's missing in their lives, realizing this absent piece is integral to their identity and life's purpose.

- **Yearning's Origins**: The object of a person's Yearning – their true identity and dream of life – might preexist the sense of Lack. This Yearning can be perceived as:
  1. A call to destiny.
  2. An innermost image of oneself.
  3. A "daimon" or guiding spirit.
  4. A soul waiting to be discovered.

- **Universal Notion**: This idea of Yearning is not just a Western concept. Native American initiation rituals, marking the transition from childhood to adulthood, included vision quests. Here, through hardship and sometimes hallucinogenic experiences, the individual would connect with a guardian spirit, or Manitou, representing their adult identity. This spirit guide, though socially affirmed, is reminiscent of the personal "daimon".

- **Strengths**:
  1. This view of Yearning provides a robust sense of self, purpose, and determination.
  2. Once recognized, this Yearning becomes undeniable. Ignoring it means neglecting one's true self and purpose.

- **Weaknesses**:
  1. This perspective might seem outdated, overly sentimental, or excessively mystical. But such criticisms often arise from poor presentation rather than the concept itself.
  2. Ideas of destiny and fate can appeal to autocratic mentalities. For instance, fascism supports a historical view where freedom means yielding individual will to an overpowering force like the state or nation.
#### YEARNING AS CALLING IN GENRE FICTION
##### Summary:

**Yearning as Calling in Genre Fiction**:

- **Foundations**: Yearning viewed as a calling or inherent destiny is often present in myths, heroic adventures, action tales, some romance stories, and even in satires as a mocked element. Examples include:
  1. A kind-hearted "traveling angel" who identifies and addresses the sadness in others.
  2. A dedicated detective who feels the endless cycle of crime and justice.
  3. A cyborg or android yearning to understand or gain humanity.
  4. A soldier-of-fortune who believes the true essence of humanity is revealed in battle.
  5. A lover seeking someone who truly understands and sees them.

- **Genre Fiction**: These character archetypes are typically found in genre fiction. Yet, it's important to note that genre fiction isn't strictly bound by this characterization of Yearning.

- **Depth and Execution**: The relationship between Yearning and Lack, when framed in this manner, isn't inherently shallow or clichéd. It depends on the execution in the narrative. 

- **Historical Context**: This notion of Yearning as a calling or innate identity echoes pre-Renaissance views on humanity's role in the world. This perspective experienced a resurgence after modern events like the world wars and the Holocaust highlighted the inadequacies of certain philosophical perspectives like materialism and relativism.

- **Modern Relevance**: The 20th century's events prompted a reevaluation of certain worldviews. Developments in areas like Jungian analysis, Positive Psychology, and a revived interest in ancient philosophy, underscore a shift back to the idea that life has inherent direction and meaning, pushing individuals to seek purpose and identity.
#### THE SENSE OF CALLING IN DISTINGUISHED INDIVIDUALS
##### Summary:

**The Sense of Calling in Distinguished Individuals**:

- The concept of Yearning as a calling or innate purpose, often realized early in one's life, is prominent in the life stories of several renowned figures.

- **R.C. Collingwood**: As a child, when he stumbled upon Kant’s Ethics, he felt a powerful pull towards its significance and a personal duty to engage with its content. This experience ignited his conviction to think and delve into philosophy.

- **Judy Garland (Frances “Baby” Gumm)**: Born in a theater environment, a very young Garland was enchanted by a performance she witnessed. Feeling an intrinsic draw to the stage, she asked her father if she could perform. Her early performance captured the audience's heart, indicating her undeniable talent and her unwavering direction towards stardom.

- These instances highlight not just a fleeting passion or a temporary aspiration but a profound sense of identity and purpose. These figures felt a deeply rooted sentiment akin to: "This is my essence. This is my destiny."

- This inherent calling isn't a transient emotion but instead shadows these individuals throughout their lives. It is evident in their drive, their unwavering commitment to their passion, and their resilience in facing challenges. This determination allows them to navigate obstacles, adapt, and remain dedicated to their true calling.
#### WHAT EXACTLY DO WE MEAN BY GREATNESS IN A CHARACTER?

##### Summary:

**Understanding Greatness in Characters**:

- While many exemplary character biographies focus on the famous or extraordinary, the concept of greatness isn't limited to such people. 

- Greatness isn't about fame, status, or elitism. Instead, it's about virtues like excellence, integrity, beauty, courage, and truth. These virtues resonate with everyone, irrespective of social or economic backgrounds.

- The portrayal of exceptional individuals in stories remains prevalent and inspiring. For instance:
  - Winston Churchill has been represented extensively in film and TV.
  - Historical dramas, like those about the Tudors, Borgias, and Queen Elizabeth II, continue to be popular.
  - Renowned fictional characters from epics and tragedies such as Achilles, Oedipus, Lear, and Macbeth exhibit a unique kind of greatness.
  
- Not all characters with greatness have royal lineage. Many embody a profound commitment to moral responsibility and the greater good. Examples include:
  - Detectives like Harry Bosch and Jane Tennison.
  - Characters from "The West Wing".
  - Runaway slaves in Colson Whitehead’s "The Underground Railroad".

- The portrayal of such characters aims to inspire, offer historical insights, or caution against overambition. Their greatness isn't derived from mere vanity, ambition, or greed but from a deep sense of identity, integrity, and responsibility. This is especially true when they face immense challenges or opposition.
#### DESTINY AS A CALLING TO CHARACTER OR VOCATION
##### Summary:

**Destiny as a Call to Character or Vocation**:

- The idea of destiny isn't necessarily tied to fame or significant achievements. Instead, it emphasizes a call to character – staying true to one's values and beliefs regardless of external rewards.

- A poignant illustration of this is found in Gustave Flaubert’s “A Simple Heart.” The protagonist, Félicité, leads an ordinary life. Her uniqueness emerges from her selfless love and unwavering religious devotion. Her story doesn't revolve around worldly recognition but staying true to her personal identity.

- Often, a sense of calling is linked to a commitment to others, springing from a deep-seated sense of duty. This devotion can be seen in various professions where individuals serve others selflessly, from military and religious vocations to teachers, police officers, and nurses.

- A personal vocation or calling is about recognizing and pursuing excellence in one's domain, whether socially driven or personally motivated. It's about dedicating oneself to a craft or cause.

- This sentiment is echoed in Peter Temple's Jack Irish novels. The main character, Jack, had his life upended by tragedy but finds solace and purpose in craftsmanship under the guidance of a cabinetmaker, Charlie Taub. Charlie’s unwavering commitment to perfection not only challenges Jack but also serves as a moral compass, helping him rediscover passion and direction in life.

In essence, the idea posited is that destiny's true calling lies in pursuing character, purpose, and integrity, rather than seeking fame or grandeur.

#### A CAUTIONARY WORD ON OVERSIMPLIFICATION
##### Summary:

**A Cautionary Word on Oversimplification**:

- While the concept of Yearning as a calling has its merits, it's crucial to avoid reducing characters' motivations to singular, straightforward reasons. Doing so can make the character feel shallow or unbelievable to the audience.
 
- Just attributing a character's actions to basic motivators like fame or revenge can make their pursuits seem insignificant or trivial. Similarly, if a character's Yearning or destiny is too neatly wrapped up, it can come across as forced or insincere.

- One solution to this oversimplification is to embed the sense of calling in complex symbols. Symbols are multifaceted and can have varying interpretations, which adds depth to the narrative. The intricate nature of symbols, combined with the demands they place on characters, can counteract the risk of making the character's motivation seem too simplistic.

- Ultimately, the central idea is that if a character identifies with Yearning as a significant part of their identity, it signifies an understanding of a core truth about themselves. Living contrary to this calling means living inauthentically. It's essential to represent this with depth and complexity to ensure the character's journey resonates authentically with the audience.
### IV. YEARNING AS A NATURAL OUTGROWTH OF LACK

#### Summary:

**Formation of Individual Identity and Character**:

1. **Skepticism About Abstract Concepts**: Many people are skeptical about ideas like the soul, destiny, and "psychic twins," preferring a more concrete, materialist explanation for human experience.

2. **Beginnings of Life**:
    - At birth, we are vulnerable and wholly reliant on others.
    - This early dependence makes us perceive caregivers either as benevolent protectors or potential threats.
  
3. **Emergence of Self-Identity**:
    - As children, we are given names, which initiates our basic sense of identity.
    - Much of our personalities take shape during childhood, where our yearnings stem from what we lack or desire: autonomy, understanding, romance, adventure, and identity.

4. **Adolescent Transformation**:
    - During adolescence, our unique sense of identity strengthens.
    - A sense of purpose or ambition starts to form, influenced by internal feelings and external guidance.

5. **Character Development**:
    - The non-literary concept of "character" refers to the durability and adaptability of an individual's identity, including their moral compass and emotional desires.
    - Character is not static; it evolves in response to life's challenges, successes, and the inevitability of mortality.

6. **The Evolution of Yearning and Lack**:
    - It is not an inherent Yearning but rather a Lack—a feeling of incompleteness—that serves as the foundation for our lives.
    - Yearning is cultivated progressively as we journey through life, guiding us towards what we aspire and away from past struggles.
    - Rather than being innate, Lack and Yearning are developed through life experiences, molded by the challenges of the world.

In essence, our sense of identity, character, and aspirations is a dynamic process, deeply influenced by the stages of our life and the experiences we undergo. These elements are not preordained but evolve as we engage with the world around us.

**Summary:**

**Fashioning Identity Through Experience:**

1. **The Self as Social Construct**: Our identity is shaped by our experiences and relationships. Throughout our lives, we are influenced by those around us, from our parents to mentors to friends. Our sense of self might be a compilation of the traits we admire in them. This concept echoes the idea that our destiny is crafted by the influences we select.

2. **Roots of Yearning**: Yearning, or our deep desires, can be grounded in our experiences of "Lack" or deficiency. We yearn for things when we sense something missing or inadequate in our lives.

3. **The Power and Limitations of Lack as a Cause of Yearning**: While identifying what we lack can provide motivation and direction, it doesn't always spark the willfulness required to pursue our desires. A materialistic view of yearning may not always summon the passion and drive needed for a compelling life journey.

4. **Willfulness**: For a protagonist to be compelling, they must have a strong sense of will. This determination can come from their nature, past experiences, or both. Understanding a character's backstory is crucial in determining why they persist in the face of adversity.

5. **Identity Formation Through Experience**: Some individuals might not have a pre-defined destiny or intrinsic sense of purpose. Instead, they are shaped by their experiences, as seen in the example of Juliet Armstrong from Kate Atkinson’s novel, *Transcription*. Juliet's identity evolves as she navigates through the challenges of war and espionage.

6. **Limitations of Backstory-driven Motivations**: Pinpointing a single past event or "backstory wound" as the sole cause of a character's motivations can be simplistic. Real-life motivations and identities are shaped by a culmination of experiences. The character's challenges shouldn't be reduced to a single defining moment but should encompass a more comprehensive experience.

In essence, while understanding what we lack can provide insight into our desires and motivations, a compelling sense of identity and purpose often emerges from a rich tapestry of experiences and relationships. It's not just about what we lack, but how our experiences shape our yearning for a better, more meaningful life.
### V. WEIGHING AND BALANCING THE TWO APPROACHES

**Summary and Clarification:**

This passage delves into the nature of **Yearning** and its origins, emphasizing the nuances between whether Yearning is a result of innate calling or developed through life experiences.

**Main Points**:

1. **Two Views on Yearning**: 
   - Some believe Yearning is innate, an inborn sense of calling.
   - Others argue it emerges from life's challenges and experiences.
   - Neither perspective is definitively correct; both have their merits.

2. **The Debate between Materialism and Idealism**: 
   - This debate, lasting over 2500 years, highlights the complexities of choosing one perspective over another. It's alright to lean one way, but writers should be open to exploring both in their characters.

3. **Reconciliation between the Two Views**:
   - There's a dynamic relationship between **Lack** (a sense of emptiness or what's missing in life) and **Yearning**.
   - Both influence each other and aren't static traits but evolve over a person's life.
   - Yearning might be shaped by life events or a tangible experience of death, emphasizing the importance and urgency of realizing one's desires or dreams.

4. **Yearning’s Influence on Actions and Decisions**: 
   - Whether Yearning is innately present or formed through life experiences, its impact is on how the individual perceives it and acts upon it.
   - Examples of historical figures, like Eleanor Roosevelt and Josephine Baker, illustrate how people's yearnings can be shaped by both innate feelings and life events.

5. **Nature vs. Nurture Debate in Yearning**: 
   - There are parallels between the debate on Yearning's origins and the nature versus nurture argument about human behavior.
   - Even if most behaviors are instinctual, the perception of choice is vital. People need to make decisions and face the consequences, regardless of whether their identity is predestined or formed through experiences.

6. **The Emergence of a Unique Sense of Self**:
   - As people grow, they cultivate a distinct sense of identity. This identity consists of both inherent elements and adaptability to life's circumstances. 
   - Over time, Yearning evolves from a mere possibility to an undeniable necessity driven by passion, urgency, and gravity.

In essence, the text posits that while there's a longstanding debate about the source of Yearning, it's critical to recognize its profound influence on human actions and decisions. Both innate senses of purpose and life experiences can shape Yearning, but its true significance lies in how individuals perceive and respond to it.

### VI. HOW YEARNING DEFINES THE STAKES

**Summary and Clarification**:

This passage delves into the concept of **Yearning** and how it establishes the stakes for a character in a story. Yearning is portrayed as the deepest desire or need of a character, giving them purpose and defining their journey.

**Main Points**:

1. **Yearning and Action**:
    - A character’s Yearning becomes evident through their actions and choices. This is especially true when they face challenges while trying to achieve their goals (referred to as Desire).

2. **Conflict and Yearning**:
    - As characters face obstacles, the intensity of their struggles can amplify. These difficulties, ranging from betrayals to outright disasters, lead the character to question why they continue despite adversity. The root cause for perseverance lies in their Yearning.

3. **Realization of the Depth of Yearning**: 
    - Through their challenges, a character may develop a deeper understanding of their core longing or Yearning. This realization establishes the stakes: the character must acknowledge this Yearning or face significant consequences in various forms (psychological, emotional, moral, etc.).

4. **True Stakes**: 
    - The highest stakes in a story aren’t necessarily physical dangers, but rather the deeper needs and desires of the character. If they don’t honor their Yearning, they face the internal shame of failure.

5. **Dante Alighieri's Example**: 
    - Dante found solace during trying times by reconnecting with his love for Beatrice, exemplifying how one's deep Yearning can guide them through hardships.

6. **Exterior Struggles and Inner Longings**: 
    - Even in genres focusing on external conflicts (e.g., thrillers or adventure tales), the core of the character's actions ties back to an internal Yearning. This could be a need for justice, survival, adventure, or freedom.

7. **Origin of Yearning**: 
    - It's crucial to understand why a character has certain Yearnings and how they shape their identity and life. These Yearnings might be inherent or could have been shaped by past experiences. Some might initially have a vague sense of their Yearning, which becomes clearer as they face challenges.

8. **Consequences of Failure**: 
    - Not all characters succeed in fulfilling their Yearnings. Such failures become life-defining moments, leaving them either in acceptance, anxiety, or denial.

In essence, the passage underscores the significance of Yearning in defining a character's stakes and journey. Understanding and crafting this deep desire can amplify the emotional depth and relatability of a character, making their struggles and achievements more resonant.

### VII. YEARNING’S INEFFABLE NATURE

**Summary and Clarification**:

This passage primarily delves into the idea of a character's "Yearning" in storytelling — a deep, inherent desire or longing that shapes a character's journey. It's not just about what the character wants on the surface but pertains more to their internal drive, how they perceive themselves, and what gives their life meaning.

**Main Points**:

1. **The Complex Nature of Yearning**:
   - Milan Kundera's quote establishes that the journey of self-discovery often ends in paradoxical dissatisfaction. Simplifying the profound nature of a character's yearning to mere phrases like "To come home" or "To find true love" diminishes its essence. As seen in Mary Fulton Holliday's journal entry, these desires are more intricate and tied deeply to identity.

2. **Symbols and Their Significance**: 
   - Certain symbols, like Dante's Beatrice or Gatsby's green light, serve as representative anchors of characters' deep-seated yearnings. These symbols often transcend their physical or literal representations, resonating with profound aspirations, memories, or longings.

3. **Contemporary Character Yearnings**:
   - The passage provides examples like Charlotte Roy from "November Road" and Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd from "News of the World". Charlotte's longing is to break free from her mundane life, driven by an undefined but palpable urge for something more. Captain Kidd's yearning revolves around his calling as a messenger, leading to his eventual role in helping a young girl find her rightful place.

4. **Existential Codes**: 
   - Milan Kundera introduces the idea of an "existential code" for characters, a set of keywords reflecting their fundamental dilemmas or desires. For instance, in "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", Tereza's existential code includes words like "body" and "Paradise", while Tomas's is "lightness" and "weight".

5. **Yearning's Open-endedness**: 
   - A character's core yearning is not fixed; it's influenced by formative experiences and can evolve over time. It's essential to avoid simplifying yearnings into cliched phrases or concepts as they often fail to capture the character's depth. Instead, symbols or even artworks can better represent these profound desires, providing multifaceted interpretations.

6. **Yearning's Dual Nature**:
   - While the abstract, symbolic representation of yearning offers a profound understanding of a character, there's a need to balance it with concrete elements to serve the narrative effectively.

In essence, the passage highlights that a character's yearning isn't just a mere want but a deeply rooted desire intertwined with identity, experiences, and perceptions. Utilizing symbols and existential codes can enrich storytelling by providing nuanced insights into characters, making them more relatable and compelling.


### VIII. BRINGING YEARNING DOWN TO STORY SIZE

**Summary and Clarification**:

The excerpt underscores the challenge writers face in presenting characters with deep, broad histories and internal lives within the confines of a narrative. It touches upon the idea of "Yearning" as an ever-present, evolving, and mostly unfulfilled desire within a character.

**Key Points**:

1. **Balancing Act**: Writers must balance understanding a character’s expansive life with the specific events of a story. A narrative only provides a glimpse into a character's life, but it needs to feel complete and convincing.

2. **The Ever-Evolving Yearning**: Every character has a deep-seated Yearning, a desire stemming from their incomplete nature. However, a character never fully satisfies this Yearning. As one goal is achieved, the Yearning evolves and shifts focus. 

3. **Yearning Horizon**: Within the story, a character might approach their Yearning, even if they don't fully realize it. This is called the "Yearning Horizon." It’s an interim destination where the character becomes slightly closer to their deeper desire. By the story's end, characters should show growth—be it in bravery, honesty, or love—even if it's imperfect.

4. **Example - "Chance" by Kem Nunn**: Eldon Chance, the protagonist, exemplifies a character with a Yearning rooted in his past failures. He yearns to be a healer, engage fully in life, and protect those he loves without fear of regressing into past obsessive behaviors. Through the events of the story and his relationship with Jaclyn Blackstone, Dr. Chance inches closer to his Yearning Horizon, becoming more decisive and active. However, by the story’s end, it's evident that his journey of self-realization has just begun.

5. **Creating Characters with Depth**: When developing characters, writers should heed the advice of Constantin Stanislavski, remembering that a story's events are but a fraction of a character's life. Characters should have complex Yearnings that resist neat categorizations, even if such categorizations help structure the narrative.

In essence, the passage emphasizes the depth of the human experience and the challenge of condensing it within a narrative. Characters should be multi-dimensional, with desires that evolve and journeys that, while progressing, might never fully conclude within the story's scope.


### IX. NO MAN IS AN ISLAND: THE ROLE OF OTHERS IN THE CHARACTER'S YEARNING
**Summary and Clarification**:

The excerpt discusses the innate human desire for connection and the inherent risks in imagining a character's yearning in isolation from others. The key points and ideas emphasized are:

1. **Human Desire for Connection**: Despite varied backgrounds, personalities, or circumstances, humans inherently seek connection. This drive is rooted in infancy, where dependency on others is paramount.

2. **Loners and Outcasts**: Characters who are seemingly isolated or prefer solitude are still defined concerning the society from which they distance themselves. Their isolation might be chosen or imposed upon them, but their yearning still revolves around connections in some way.

3. **Conflict of Personal Integrity vs. Social Desires**: Authenticity, integrity, and dignity are vital to personal fulfillment. But they might sometimes conflict with the needs or desires of loved ones or society at large. The tension between individual truth and the desires of others can be a powerful narrative tool.

4. **Examples of Loners and Outcasts**:
   - **Detective Harry Bosch**: Even though Bosch is depicted as an outsider, he carefully chooses his connections and deeply cares about his daughter.
   - **Thoreau**: While living in solitude, he maintained open connections, suggesting that solitude enhanced rather than restricted his sense of connection.
   - **Religious Solitaries**: They seek solitude not for its own sake but to foster a deeper connection with a higher power.
   - **Outcasts like Quasimodo and Hester Prynne**: Their stories emphasize their yearning for human connection despite being shunned by society.

5. **Connection Beyond Immediate Circle**: Many characters not only seek personal connections but also a broader bond with their community, nation, or even the world. Such characters display an expansive spirit and often take on roles of leadership or moral guidance.

6. **Inevitability of Connection**: Regardless of how much a character might try to distance themselves or how much they've been isolated by circumstances, there remains a yearning for connection. Whether it's hoping for love, camaraderie, or a sense of belonging, the majority of characters can't imagine a life devoid of meaningful relationships.

In essence, the text argues that understanding a character's Yearning requires acknowledging their need for connection, regardless of their circumstances or chosen paths. While some might stray far from society, their stories often revolve around the ties they've broken, the ones they maintain, and the new ones they forge.


### SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN THIS CHAPTER

**Summary and Clarification**:

This text discusses the concept of "Yearning" as a crucial component in storytelling, its relation to a character's sense of Lack, and the implications for shaping a compelling narrative.

1. **Yearning as the Dream of Life**: Yearning represents a character's core desire to achieve their ideal self and life. It's not just about external ambitions but their very identity and relationships.

2. **Relationship Between Yearning and Lack**: Yearning is often the opposite of what's missing in a character's life (Lack). This absence in their life is what makes them strive for something more.

3. **The Concept of Daimon**: The character's Yearning can be seen as a call to destiny, symbolized by a daimon - a motivating force that directs and informs their life.

4. **Yearning from Life's Struggles**: Yearning can also be seen as arising from life's challenges. It might be shaped by experiences of deprivation and might be based on people the character admires and wishes to emulate.

5. **Weighing Innate Yearning vs. Acquired Yearning**: While some believe Yearning is innate, others think it develops from life's hardships. But in any story, the character's guiding compass towards their better self must be evident.

6. **Yearning and the Stakes in a Story**: The character's Yearning is what keeps them going despite challenges. It defines why they don't give up and what's truly at stake for them.

7. **The Complex Nature of Yearning**: Reducing Yearning to a simple phrase or concept can belittle its depth. It's often better to represent it symbolically for a more profound understanding.

8. **Yearning in the Story's Context**: The story captures just a segment of a character's life and their Yearning. So, the climax of your narrative should touch upon the partial fulfillment of this Yearning.

9. **The Role of Relationships**: Yearning often involves connections with others. Even characters who are portrayed as loners have an intrinsic need for connection.

In essence, Yearning is a central theme that drives character development and plot progression. By understanding its nuances, writers can craft resonant and emotionally rich narratives.

## 4 Why the Character's Yearning Remains Unfulfilled-Resistance 
**Summary and Clarification**:

The chapter discusses the concept of Resistance in the journey of a character's self-definition and pursuit of their dream of life. It emphasizes the interconnected relationship between three forces: Lack, Yearning, and Resistance.

1. **The Forces at Play**:
   - **Yearning**: This represents a character's aspirations, their dream of life.
   - **Lack**: This reflects what's missing in the character's life, often created or intensified by their unfulfilled Yearnings.
   - **Resistance**: These are the challenges that stifle or prevent the character from achieving their Yearning.

2. **Relationship of Forces**:
   - Yearning and Resistance are in constant opposition, representing life's promises and pains, respectively. 
   - The conflict between these two often intensifies the feeling of Lack.
   - Resistance can often create an inner protective shield in characters, making them hesitate or avoid chasing their dreams due to fear of failure and its accompanying emotions.

3. **Forms of Resistance**:
   - **Weaknesses**: Traits like laziness, cynicism, cowardice, etc.
   - **Wounds**: Past traumas or losses that inhibit their abilities.
   - **Limitations**: Factors such as age, inexperience, health, or economic status.
   - **Opposition/Obligation**: External challenges, often personified in other characters or societal norms. These can also manifest as pressing responsibilities.
   - **Flaws**: Negative traits like greed, cruelty, manipulation, etc.

4. **Interconnectedness of Resistance Elements**: The different forms of Resistance aren't isolated. They often interplay and amplify one another.

5. **Character Development Caution**: Authors shouldn't overload characters with every type of Resistance. The suitability of each form of Resistance should emerge naturally from the character's backstory.

In essence, while characters are driven by their Yearnings and are aware of their Lacks, they also face various forms of Resistance. Recognizing and understanding these forces can help in crafting a more layered and compelling narrative.
### I. WEAKNESSES
**Summary and Clarification**:

**I. WEAKNESSES**

1. **Nature of Weaknesses**:
   - Ancient moralists viewed virtue as a habit needing consistent practice because of the natural, tempting vices or Weaknesses inherent in us.
   - These Weaknesses can be innate or developed over time due to experiences and personal development.
   - Weaknesses are predispositions towards specific behaviors, not actions themselves. If unchecked, they can weaken a character's conviction and belief in themselves.
   - Overcoming these Weaknesses often requires lifelong effort or a significant event.

2. **List of Weaknesses**:
   - The Seven Capital Vices: pride, greed, envy, rage, gluttony, lust, and sloth.
   - Other Weaknesses: Cowardice, Denial, Insecurity, Cynicism, Despair, Apathy, Indulgence (drink, sex, drugs), Irritability, Impulsiveness, and craving for constant stimulation.
   - Addictive behaviors, often rooted in deep-seated personal shame, are also seen as Weaknesses.

3. **From Weakness to Strength**:
   - Identifying a character's Weakness often demands understanding their backstory, especially where their shame originated.
   - Recognizing one's Weaknesses and converting them to strengths involves mindfulness and discipline. For instance:
     - Cowardice to Courage
     - Denial to Acceptance
     - Cynicism to Purposefulness
   - These transformations reflect mature self-awareness.

4. **Examples and Observations**:
   - The pursuit of a meaningful life can be hampered by Weaknesses. These can make people avoid challenges or situations that might bring pain.
   - Examples of characters exhibiting Weaknesses:
     - In *November Road*, Charlotte Roy's confidence wanes due to past traumas, leading her to avoid challenges.
     - In *A Doll's House*, Nora Helmer's dependence on her husband exemplifies a Weakness rooted in seeking security.
   - Notably, even seemingly positive traits can turn into Weaknesses. The quest for a utopian ideal, without the hard work of creating a just society, can be destructive, as seen in the tragic end of many historical social and religious movements.

In essence, while everyone possesses Weaknesses, recognizing and transforming them into strengths requires awareness, discipline, and sometimes external interventions. Characters in narratives reflect these human intricacies, making their journeys more relatable and compelling.
### II. WOUNDS
**Summary and Clarification**:

**II. WOUNDS AND THEIR IMPACT ON CHARACTERS**

Wounds, in a literary context, refer to traumatic events or experiences that significantly alter the course of a character's life, leading to deep emotional pain and existential questioning. Such wounds can arise from experiences like unexpected deaths, betrayals, or other significant losses.

**Key Points**:

1. **Depth of Wounds**: Experiencing a sudden loss or betrayal can send individuals into profound emotional turmoil, leading to questions about life's purpose, meaning, and fairness.

2. **Impact of Death**: Death, in particular, challenges our perceptions of existence and makes us question our roles, dreams, and the uncertainty of life.

3. **Effects of Lost Love and Betrayal**: Lost love, be it romantic or familial, can bring about self-doubt and feelings of worthlessness. Similarly, betrayal can severely dent one's ability to trust again, impacting relationships and aspirations.

4. **Wounds Distort Perception of Life**: Wounds can shatter an individual's established understanding of life. They disrupt one's sense of reality, leading to feelings of disorientation, despair, and a loss of faith in the future.

5. **Literary Examples**:
   - In *News of the World*, Johanna Leonberger suffers multiple traumas - first being taken by the Kiowa after they kill her family, and then being torn from the Kiowa by the U.S. cavalry. These experiences leave her struggling to find meaning and direction.
   - Jackson Brodie in Kate Atkinson's novels lives under the weight of guilt tied to his family tragedies, influencing his personal and professional life.
   - In *Atonement*, Briony Tallis tries to make amends for a grave mistake that had catastrophic consequences for those she loved.
   
6. **PTSD and Moral Injury**: These conditions, resultant from traumatic events, significantly alter an individual's perspective and reactions to life. In the film *Fearless*, two plane crash survivors showcase different coping mechanisms post-trauma: one with ecstatic denial (Max Klein) and another with profound grief and guilt (Carla Rodrigo).

In essence, wounds in literature symbolize deeply traumatic events that can reshape a character's outlook on life, sometimes leading them to question their very existence, purpose, and the nature of relationships. These wounds provide a rich vein for character development and conflict in storytelling.

### III. LIMITATIONS
**SUMMARY & CLARIFICATION:**

**Limitations** are external constraints that hinder an individual's ability to chase their desired life. However, these limitations can also stem from the individual's own beliefs or feelings about themselves.

**Types of Limitations:**

1. **Youth/Inexperience:** Due to being seen as "too young," individuals are often not taken seriously or given opportunities. For instance, in "Old Mortality," sisters Maria and Miranda face limitations due to their youth and gender. While in "To Kill a Mockingbird," Scout struggles with her young age and its associated expectations.

2. **Advanced Age:** As people age, they face new challenges. They might be battling against time or against their declining health. "Here on a Visit" presents three retirees battling societal perceptions of old age.

3. **Poor Health/Injury:** Health issues, both physical and psychological, can redefine one's aspirations and lifestyle. Tennessee Williams’s "The Glass Menagerie" showcases Laura Wingfield, whose physical disability hinders her from pursuing her life's dream.

4. **Physical Abnormality:** Characters like Tyrion Lannister from "Game of Thrones" face limitations due to visible physical differences, affecting their self-worth and interactions with others.

5. **Mental Illness:** Some characters face mental challenges that deter their pursuits. Carrie Mathison from "Homeland" grapples with her bipolar personality disorder, which impacts her career and personal life.

6. **Homeliness:** Physical appearance can impact self-esteem and opportunities. Characters like Jane Eyre and Midge from "Vertigo" contend with their perceived unattractiveness and the societal ramifications that come with it.

7. **Lack of Intelligence:** Some characters, despite their ambitions, lack the intelligence to realize them. Examples from crime genres often showcase characters whose aspirations exceed their capabilities.

In essence, these limitations shape characters' narratives, their self-worth, and their pursuit of their dreams. Whether these limitations are real or perceived, they present both challenges and opportunities for growth, making for compelling stories.
### IV. OPPOSITION/OBLIGATION
**SUMMARY & CLARIFICATION:**

**OPPOSITION/OBLIGATION**:
The excerpt delves into the external forces that hinder a character's yearning or dream. Unlike internal factors like weaknesses and limitations, opposition or obligation often emerges from external characters or societal constructs. This external resistance can sometimes be internalized, affecting the character's self-perception and behavior.

**1. PARENTAL INFLUENCE:**
Parental influence can sway an individual's dreams and aspirations. Parents can negatively influence through harsh criticism, cruelty, or cynicism or positively through overprotectiveness and excessive forgiveness. An example given is Charlotte Roy from "November Road", whose mother's anxiety after her husband's death shapes Charlotte's own fears and hesitations. Another example is Colin Craven from "The Secret Garden", who believes he's critically ill, mostly because of the isolation he feels after his mother's death and father's subsequent rejection.

**2. TEACHERS, CLERGY, AND OTHER AUTHORITY FIGURES:**
Teachers and religious figures can also play a pivotal role in shaping or stifling a young person's ambitions. An example is from "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie", where a teacher's fascination with fascism deeply impacts her students, especially Sandy, leading her to take drastic actions.

**3. PEER PRESSURE:**
Peers, friends, and other age-mates can exert pressure that distracts or pulls a character away from their dream. "Breaking Bad" showcases this where Jesse Pinkman's friends want him to remain in the drug business despite his personal conflicts.

**4. CARE FOR ANOTHER:**
Obligations towards family, whether children or elderly parents, can also inhibit one's dreams. For example, Julius Kane from "The Red Pyramid" suppresses his powers to keep his children safe.

**5. CLASS/SOCIAL STANDING:**
Social standing and class, often intertwined with financial circumstances, dictate opportunities and self-perception. Characters from literature like "The Grapes of Wrath" and "The House of Mirth" portray how poverty and societal perceptions can limit an individual's aspirations.

**6. MINORITY STATUS:**
Being part of a minority, whether based on race, sex, or immigrant status, can impose external pressures. The main concern is the majority's attempt to dictate a minority's identity and way of life. "Native Son" portrays racial pressures, while Jane Austen's novels and "House of Mirth" show societal expectations on women. The BBC series "Prime Suspect" demonstrates the obstacles women face in male-dominated professions.

In essence, while internal struggles can hinder a character's pursuit of their dreams, external pressures often pose equally challenging barriers, all of which can provide rich material for dramatic portrayals in storytelling.
### V. FLAWS
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Flaws as a Unique Force of Resistance**:
The section dives deep into the concept of "Flaws" as a form of Resistance in characters. Unlike other forms like Weaknesses, Wounds, and Limitations, Flaws stand out because:

1. **Moral Impact**: Flaws have a moral undertone. They represent the character's capacity to not only harm themselves but also to inflict pain on others. Examples of such flaws include selfishness, deceitfulness, and cruelty. These flaws often lead to repercussions for the character, resulting from the harm they cause to others.
  
2. **Origins of Flaws**: Many times, Flaws emerge from or are influenced by other forces of Resistance such as Weaknesses, Wounds, and Limitations. While some individuals might inherently possess malicious traits, most harmful behaviors can be traced back to the character's response to these other resistances.

**Examples**:
Several examples illustrate how other resistances can lead to Flaws:

- Miss Jean Brodie's arrogance leads her to manipulate others.
- Captain Ahab's obsession with revenge for his lost leg disregards the safety of his crew.
- Blanche Dubois’s past traumas fuel her predatory behavior on younger men.

**Creating Flaws in Characters**:
Writers can introduce moral flaws in characters by:
  
1. **Extremes of Virtues**: Pushing a virtue to its extreme, like an extreme love that can justify any action or an obsession with justice that disregards the rights of others.
  
2. **Derived from Other Resistances**: Examining how Weaknesses, Wounds, or Limitations can lead to bitterness, fear, or resentment, which in turn causes the character to harm others.

**Connection to Yearning**:
A crucial aspect of understanding Flaws is recognizing that they often stem from behaviors that seem self-harming, but these flaws are part of a bigger interconnected web. They hinder the character from achieving their deepest desires or "Yearning."

**Albert Camus' The Fall**:
The book is highlighted as a notable exploration of the concept of Flaws. Jean-Baptiste Clamence, the protagonist, transitions from appearing virtuous to revealing the hypocrisy of his actions, and ultimately falls from grace. Camus suggests that moral flaws are a testament to the innate guilt within human nature, which cannot be overcome, only acknowledged.

In essence, this section emphasizes the significance of understanding and crafting Flaws in characters, as these Flaws not only provide depth but also connect with other resistances, defining the character's journey and challenges.
### VI. THE INTERPLAY AMONG FACTORSAND THE OVERRIDING ISSUE
**Summary and Clarification**:

**The Interplay Among Factors and The Overriding Issue**:

1. **Forces of Resistance**:
   - These forces often work in tandem, influencing or enhancing one another. They aren't independent factors but are interconnected in shaping a character's behavior.
   - These forces emerge due to past events that affected the character deeply, prompting them to shield themselves from life's pains.

2. **Charlotte Roy's Example**:
   - Charlotte Roy's life provides a clear illustration of how these forces of Resistance interact:
     - She loses her young, healthy father to a sudden heart attack (Wound).
     - Her mother becomes emotionally unstable and overprotective, discouraging Charlotte from taking any risks (External Opposition).
     - Affected by her father’s death and her mother's behavior, Charlotte loses her self-assurance and can't adapt to university life, leading her to retreat (Weakness).
     - The impact of her father’s death spreads to other aspects of her life, causing her to prioritize self-protection over life's promises. It's only when she sees the negative impact on her daughters that she decides to break free from her past.

3. **Backstory's Importance**:
   - The backstory helps reveal protective impulses and their origins. In subsequent sections, there will be a deeper dive into how to explore a character's past to uncover these influences.

4. **Balancing Act - Yearning vs. Resistance**:
   - Every character is influenced by two core drives:
     - The aspiration to realize life's potential (Yearning).
     - The desire to shield oneself from life's pains (Resistance).
   - These two conflicting drives create tension, which often manifests as a character's perceived 'Lack'.
   - The story unfolds based on how these drives steer the character's decisions and actions.

In essence, this section underscores the interconnectedness of forces that mold a character's behavior, emphasizing the significance of backstory in understanding these forces. It also reiterates the importance of balancing the twin drives of Yearning and Resistance, which profoundly impact the narrative's progression.
### VII. GIVING THE RESISTANCE ITS OWN DAIMON
**Summary and Clarification**:

**VII. Personifying the Resistance with its Daimon**:

- **Concept of Daimon**:
  - From the previous discussions, a daimon serves as a guiding spirit for a character, often represented by an image, experience, or symbol. This spiritual guide influences the character's identity, path, and destiny, being visible through the character’s motivations, persistence, and reactions.
  - When not followed or resisted, the daimon can lead to negative effects such as depression, malaise, or physical illness.

- **Positive and Negative Daimons**:
  - Greeks believed in two types of daimons:
    - **Agathodaímōn** ("noble spirit"): A positive daimon promoting virtues, bravery, and good actions.
    - **Kakodaímōn** ("malevolent spirit"): A negative daimon emphasizing the detrimental and counterproductive aspects of character.

- **Role of Negative Daimon in Character Building**:
  - While the positive daimon encourages virtues, the negative daimon boosts the character's weaknesses, flaws, wounds, and other limiting factors.
  - In "The Art of Character," the author introduces the idea of a "Ghost" - an entity (either a character or experiences) that signifies the character's past issues, often stemming from influential figures or incidents that posed resistance or opposition.

- **Personifying Resistance**:
  - By giving the forces of resistance a face or persona, it allows both the writer and the reader to conceptualize the multiple forces acting against the character in a unified manner. This approach offers a clearer understanding of what the character is up against.

- **Examples**:
  - Laura Wingfield's glass menagerie represents her choice to escape into a delicate fantasy instead of confronting reality.
  - For Blanche Dubois, alcohol is her escape from the truth of her aging and declining allure. Alcohol both numbs her and adds to the allure of her dimly-lit world.

In essence, this section emphasizes the value of personifying or symbolizing the forces of resistance in storytelling. By doing so, it brings clarity to the character's internal struggles and provides a concrete element for readers to latch onto.
### SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN THIS CHAPTER
**Summary and Clarification**:

In this chapter, the intricate relationship between a character’s Yearning and Resistance is explored.

1. **Yearning vs. Resistance**:
   - While Lack and Yearning are interconnected, Yearning and Resistance are in opposition. Yearning is motivated by life's promise, while Resistance is driven by life's pains.

2. **Forms of Resistance**:
   - **Weaknesses**: Natural or learned traits like laziness, despair, or cynicism.
   - **Wounds**: Profound emotional or psychological injuries like the loss of a loved one or betrayal.
   - **Limitations**: Inherent or circumstantial barriers like youth, poor health, or lack of intelligence.
   - **Opposition/Obligation**: External pressures or responsibilities often personified in other characters, such as overprotective parents, societal expectations, or obligations like caregiving.
   - **Flaws**: Damaging behaviors that harm both the individual and others, often borne out of other forms of Resistance or extreme virtues.

3. **Key Characteristics**:
   - **Weaknesses**: They are ingrained dispositions, are difficult to overcome, and can either be positive (like idealism) or negative.
   - **Wounds**: They are dramatic impediments that deter the character from believing in or pursuing their dreams.
   - **Limitations**: These are beyond the character’s control and are devoid of personal blame.
   - **Opposition/Obligation**: These are primarily external but can be internalized, causing further internal Resistance.
   - **Flaws**: They harm both the individual and others around them.

4. **Interplay Among Resistance Factors**:
   - These elements of Resistance often amplify each other and are rooted in the character's past. They influence the character's behaviors and choices in the story.

5. **The Daimon of Resistance**:
   - The chapter suggests using symbolic representations, like a daimon, to illustrate a character's Resistance. This can be beneficial for understanding the character but must be done carefully to avoid oversimplifying or diminishing the character's depth.

In essence, the chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding and portraying the intricate dance between a character's desires and the myriad forces resisting them, whether internal or external.

## 5 Backstory as Behavior 
**Summary and Clarification**:

The chapter discusses the intricate relationship between a character's past (or backstory) and their present behaviors, focusing on how past experiences influence their current choices, especially concerning their aspirations and defenses against life's challenges.

1. **Role of Backstory**: 
   - The backstory provides insights into significant events or experiences in a character's life that shape their present motivations, hesitations, and behaviors.
   
2. **Quotes Context**: 
   - The quotes from John Larison and Ursula K. Le Guin underscore the themes of how past traumas can impact one's present and how avoiding suffering can also mean missing out on genuine joy.

3. **From Past to Present**:
   - While the previous chapter delved into the challenges and limitations a character faces, this chapter emphasizes understanding the origins of these challenges. It highlights the need to explore pivotal moments from the character's past that either hindered or encouraged their pursuits.

4. **Equilibrium Between Pursuit and Protection**:
   - Characters typically establish a balance between chasing their dreams (promise of life) and safeguarding themselves from hardships (pain of life). This balance is influenced by their past experiences and can range from being fulfilling and constructive to being precarious and self-destructive.

5. **Pathological Maneuvers vs. Persistent Virtues**: 
   - Characters' behaviors in response to their past can manifest in two primary ways:
     - **Pathological Maneuvers**: These are behaviors that are destructive or harmful, often resulting from past traumas or negative experiences.
     - **Persistent Virtues**: These are positive behaviors or strengths that a character consistently demonstrates, often derived from positive past experiences or inherent virtues.
     
In essence, the chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding a character's past to make sense of their present actions, choices, and behaviors. It introduces the idea that characters' behaviors can be categorized into two main types based on their past experiences: those that are destructive and those that are virtuous.
### I. EXPLORING BACKSTORY FOR THE CHARACTER’S KEY SEMINAL MOMENTS
#### A FEW WORDS ON METHODOLOGY

**Summary and Clarification:**

The text delves into how writers can effectively explore a character's backstory to create a more profound, multidimensional representation in their narratives.

**Key Points:**

1. **Backstory Importance**: Backstories are vital for understanding a character’s motivations, fears, and desires. They shape how a character interacts with the present narrative.

2. **Methodology**: Gill Dennis's approach involves pinpointing significant moments in an individual’s life. For Johnny Cash, for instance, these were the times of utmost sorrow, shame, and joy. Such events reveal deeper layers of a character, allowing for a richer story arc.

3. **Moments of Helplessness**: These moments show raw, uncontrolled reactions and can range from negative emotions like fear and guilt to positive ones like joy and courage. They provide insights into what motivates a character and what holds them back.

4. **Resistance vs. Yearning**: Exploring a character's past helps in understanding their yearnings (aspirations) and resistances (fears, traumas, limitations). By diving deep into their moments of helplessness, writers can craft a clear and compelling balance between a character's aspirations and their limitations.

5. **Focus on Specific Moments, Not General Traits**: Instead of broadly listing character traits, writers should focus on specific, powerful events from a character's past that have formed these traits. These moments can be more emotionally resonant for both the writer and the reader.

6. **Visualization**: Writers should imagine and visualize these critical moments in vivid detail, considering factors like environment, time of day, and other characters present. This aids in creating a more immersive experience.

7. **Interactions with Others**: Including other characters in these seminal moments can heighten their impact and significance, making the character's experiences more undeniable.

8. **Intensity of Experience**: It's essential for writers not to shy away from intense emotions or situations when crafting these moments. Often, the more emotionally charged a scene, the more powerful its impact on the narrative.

In essence, to create characters that resonate with readers, it's crucial for writers to delve deep into their backstories, unearthing both their moments of vulnerability and strength. This not only provides depth to the characters but also drives the narrative forward with compelling emotional force.

### **Summary**

**Fear vs. Courage:**
- Fear underpins all the forces of resistance in an individual's life. It takes various forms, from fear of failure to fear of death.
- To understand a character deeply, one should imagine a specific scene where the character faced overwhelming fear. The reaction in this moment starts forming their behavioral pattern for future similar situations.
- To understand their courage, imagine moments where they confronted and overcame fear.

**Guilt vs. Forgiveness:**
- Guilt arises when an individual does something wrong knowingly, often accentuated when there's another person harmed.
- For in-depth characterization, imagine a scene from the character’s past where they felt immense guilt. Also, imagine whether the character was ever forgiven for this act.
- If guilt remains unresolved, it might make the character long for redemption or self-atonement.

**Shame vs. Pride:**
- Shame arises when one’s actions lower their esteem in the eyes of others. It's an emotion that connects internal feelings with external perceptions.
- The counterpart, pride, may or may not involve others. One can be proud without external validation.
- Shame's intensity varies based on the individual's nature. For a complete character, imagine both their most shameful and proudest moments.

**Betrayal vs. Trust:**
- Trust, when broken, leads to feelings of betrayal, which can deeply wound an individual's psyche.
- To deeply understand a character's feelings of betrayal, explore how trust was built and then broken.
- Also, discover instances where the character’s trust was rewarded, as this might highlight their most loyal allies.

**Death or Sorrow vs. Love or Joy:**
- The pain of losing a loved one can cause an irrevocable shift in a person's life, affecting their worldview and ability to love again.
- Conversely, even in the most sorrowful lives, there's at least a fleeting moment of joy or love. Imagining these contrasting scenes for a character can help to create a fuller picture of their emotional landscape.

In essence, understanding these emotional dichotomies in a character's life can provide deeper insights into their motivations, behavior, and reactions, making them more multifaceted and relatable.


### II. FINDING THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE OR THEME AMONG BACKSTORY MOMENTS
**Summary & Clarification**:

The section discusses the idea of identifying a connecting theme or core problem within the backstory of a character, inspired by the methods of Gill Dennis.

**Key Points**:

1. **Central Idea**: Critical moments in a character's past often share a thematic element that points to the primary issue they're trying to solve in their life.
   
2. **Support for the Idea**: The concept parallels Freud's repetition compulsion theory, which posits that individuals repeatedly put themselves in situations that force them to relive past traumas in an attempt to understand and overcome them. This can highlight a character's main problem and thus the essence of their story.
   
3. **Caution Against Oversimplification**: It's essential not to boil down the complexities of a character's issues into a simple phrase or concept. This oversimplification can undermine the character's depth and richness.

4. **Characterization is an Art**: Discovering the theme within the various events of a character's backstory is more intuitive than methodical. The aim is to see how these events contribute to the character's journey towards fulfilling their desires (Yearning) while avoiding life's pains.

5. **Starting Point**: To determine the thematic core of a character, revisit their Yearning and the opposing forces (Resistance). This conflict can offer insights into the core problem they face in their life.

6. **Backstory's Evolution**: Sometimes, the overarching theme might become clear only after considerable writing and development, building upon the established backstory. There might also be missed events that could tie other moments together more coherently.

7. **Benefits of Identifying the Theme**:
   - Provides clarity on the character’s Yearning and Resistance, framing them as part of a lifelong journey.
   - Reveals the balance a character maintains between pursuing their dreams and avoiding life's pain.
   - Authenticates the character's quest for identity, making their Yearning more personal and realistic.
   - Helps in devising symbolic or concrete behaviors that best illustrate the struggle between their desires and obstacles.
   - Pinpoints the character’s central internal problem which they'll confront in the narrative. Resolving this problem shapes their "Yearning Horizon."

8. **Final Thoughts**: Writers might not always be conscious of the themes they're weaving into their stories until they've made significant progress. Letting intuition guide the initial stages of characterization can yield more genuine results than forcing a theme prematurely. Even if some themes seem clichéd, their execution can make them more nuanced and impactful.

### III. MOVING FROM MOMENTS TO HABITUAL BEHAVIOR—PATHOLOGICAL MANEUVERS AND PERSISTENT VIRTUES

**Summary & Clarification**:

The passage discusses how individuals often adopt certain patterns of behavior or "Pathological Maneuvers" in response to moments of stress, conflict, or past trauma. These behaviors, although meant as a coping mechanism, often serve as barriers that keep the individual from pursuing their true desires and aspirations.

**Key Points**:

1. **Understanding the Pathological Maneuver**: The term denotes behaviors people adopt to cope with challenging emotions. They are often maladaptive, meaning they might offer short-term relief but contribute to long-term problems.
 
2. **Origin of the Behavior**: Such behaviors can be traced back to specific moments in a person's life where they felt helpless or faced significant trauma. These moments can create forces of Resistance like Weaknesses, Wounds, or Flaws that manifest as behavior patterns.

3. **Examples**:
   - A woman, betrayed in love, avoids meaningful relationships to avoid rejection.
   - An individual passed over for promotion may avoid pursuing desired roles, settling instead for easy wins.
   - Loss of a loved one can make another avoid deep emotional connections.
   - Childhood poverty can lead to an obsession with success.
   - Being bullied can result in aggressive or defensive behaviors in adulthood.

4. **Nature of the Behavior**: The behaviors might include:
   - Avoidance or denial.
   - Acting out or self-injury.
   - Unconsciously mimicking maladaptive behavior witnessed in others.
   - Abusive behavior toward others.

5. **The Impact**: These patterns, although developed as protective mechanisms, end up hindering the individual's true growth and fulfillment. They prevent the character from achieving their Yearning – their deeper aspirations and desires.

6. **Yearning vs. Resistance**: The character's Yearning signifies their true desires in life, while Resistance represents the internal barriers preventing them from achieving it. The Pathological Maneuver is a manifestation of this resistance.

In essence, while these behavioral patterns might seem beneficial in the short term, they eventually lead to a life that is far removed from what the individual truly desires, thereby creating a "living death". The challenge is for characters (and people) to recognize these patterns and find ways to overcome them.

---

**Summary & Clarification**:

The passage delves into the concept of "Persistent Virtues" – these are positive behavioral traits that are born out of moments of bravery, forgiveness, pride, and other uplifting experiences. Unlike maladaptive behaviors, which often stem from negative experiences and become barriers, Persistent Virtues are beneficial habits that develop from positive experiences.

**Key Points**:

1. **Understanding Persistent Virtues**: Just as negative experiences can lead to damaging behavior, moments of bravery, forgiveness, and pride can result in positive habits. These are termed as Persistent Virtues.

2. **Examples of Persistent Virtues**:
   - A man's courageous act of saving a woman from a burning car instills in him confidence in his ability to act under pressure. However, his motivations for the rescue (the driver's attractiveness) makes him question the purity of his bravery.
   - A woman's act of stealing from her grandfather and the subsequent profound experience of his forgiveness instilled in her a strong sense of self-awareness and mindfulness that helps her resist temptations.
   - A boy's secret act of returning a lost sum of money gives him a hidden source of pride and validation. Even when he faces criticism, he holds onto this secret virtue as a testament to his character.

3. **Complexity of Persistent Virtues**: Positive moments are seldom pure. They often come intertwined with complexities, doubts, or secondary motives. Even though they instill positive traits, the nature of these experiences is nuanced.

4. **Life's Imperfections**: The author emphasizes that pure moments of positive experiences like joy or pride are rare. Over time, even moments of triumph become tainted or lose their shine. Just as losses deeply impact athletes more than wins, life's moments of joy or pride become weathered with time.

In essence, while negative experiences can lead to damaging behaviors, moments of bravery, forgiveness, pride, and love can foster Persistent Virtues. However, these positive experiences, like all aspects of life, are often complex and seldom untouched by secondary motives or doubts.

---
**Summary:**

The analysis presents a methodology for creating depth in fictional characters by tracing their behaviors back to key moments in their pasts. 

1. **Pathological Maneuvers**: Begin with a painful moment that shakes the character's self-belief. This moment fosters a resistance which can manifest as a psychological wound, weakness, or limitation. Over time, this results in a specific behavior, which can be avoidant, reckless, or even abusive towards others. 

2. **Persistent Virtues**: Start by identifying a positive moment in the character's past that reinforces their self-worth and life's purpose. Even though life's hardships might tarnish the memory, some positive residue remains, revealing itself in daily behaviors. These behaviors may manifest as acts of kindness, commitment, and resilience, demonstrating the character's belief in the goodness of life.

The analysis emphasizes the power of showing rather than explicitly detailing these moments in storytelling, creating intrigue in the narrative. With practice, this methodology becomes easier for writers to use, allowing them to craft multi-dimensional characters that resonate with audiences. It’s crucial for writers to gauge how much backstory to reveal to maintain suspense and intrigue.

Using the TV series "Bloodline" as an example, the analysis breaks down how the two main characters, Danny and John, exhibit behaviors shaped by their traumatic past. The story's slow revelation of the key event (Sarah's death) builds suspense and depth, showcasing the potential of this methodology in creating compelling narratives.
### SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN THIS CHAPTER
**Summary and Clarification**:

This chapter delves into the importance of a character's backstory, especially their seminal moments of vulnerability and strength, and how these moments influence their present behaviors and decisions. 

**Key Points**:

1. **Dual Levels of Character**: Every character has two layers – the public persona everyone sees and a deeper, subconscious emotional realm that influences their actions.
 
2. **Moments of Helplessness**: These are pivotal incidents in a character's past where their emotions or reactions were beyond their conscious control. Such moments provide insight into their internal struggles between their life aspirations (Yearning) and the challenges that hold them back (Resistance).

3. **Pathological Maneuvers & Persistent Virtues**:
   * **Pathological Maneuvers**: Negative behaviors stemming from painful past experiences. They manifest as attitudes like denial, avoidance, harmful behaviors (e.g., substance abuse), and potentially abusive behaviors towards others.
   * **Persistent Virtues**: Positive behaviors arising from moments of joy, courage, love, etc. These behaviors reflect the character's underlying belief in life's potential and provide them with the resilience to pursue their dreams.

4. **Ten Potential Areas of Helplessness**: The chapter provides a list of contrasting emotional experiences like Pain/Promise, Fear/Courage, and Guilt/Forgiveness, among others, as prompts to explore moments of vulnerability in the character's past. However, these are mere suggestions, not rigid directives.

5. **Thematic Connective Tissue**: All the moments of vulnerability in a character's history often share a theme. Recognizing this theme can point to the central issue the character is trying to resolve in their life and thus form the backbone of their story. This theme ties the character's Yearning with the forces of Resistance.

6. **Revealing Through Behavior**: The real utility of understanding a character's Pathological Maneuvers and Persistent Virtues for a writer is the ability to reveal the character's history through their behavior, instead of direct exposition. This approach engages readers by allowing them to deduce the character's past based on their actions and decisions.

7. **Limited Backstory Exposition**: While it's essential for the writer to understand the character's backstory, it isn't always necessary to detail it entirely in the story. Leaving some aspects unexplained can create intrigue and allow readers to engage their imagination.

In essence, this chapter underscores the significance of a well-crafted backstory. By understanding and integrating seminal moments from a character's past, writers can depict a more authentic and compelling character evolution, adding depth and relatability to their narrative.
## 6 Prime Mover, Desire—Not ConflictDrives Story

### I. DESIRE DRIVES STORY
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Key Points**:

1. **The Role of Desire**: Every character starts with a sense of Lack—something missing in their life. This Lack corresponds to an unfulfilled Yearning or life aspiration. This Yearning is hindered by various forms of Resistance, both internal and external. These battles manifest in daily behaviors called Pathological Maneuvers and Persistent Virtues.

2. **Triggering Action**: A particular event or shift in circumstances activates the character's Desire to act. This Desire can range from romantic pursuits (like Gatsby's chase for Daisy) to survival instincts (like Katniss in the Hunger Games). Essentially, the narrative gains momentum when the character acts upon their desire.

3. **Disturbance of Status Quo**: The choice to act typically arises when the character's daily life or balance (between Yearning and Resistance) is disrupted. This disruption can either be a positive opportunity (like a newfound love) or a negative occurrence (such as a tragedy). Moreover, it's possible for multiple motivators or changing desires to drive the character's actions as the story unfolds.

4. **Evolution of Desire**: As characters navigate their narrative landscapes, their desires may shift, reflecting their evolving Yearning. For instance, in the film "A Prophet," Malik starts with a basic desire to survive in prison but ends up with a heightened ambition of leading a gang, which wasn't apparent at the story's outset.

5. **Tension and Desire**: The onset of Desire also establishes tension by posing questions without immediate answers. Although many regard conflict as the heart of a narrative, it's the Desire that truly propels the story forward. Conflict, on its own, arrests movement and creates tension. But it's the obstructed Desire that generates this tension.

6. **Conflict vs. Desire**: Conflict arises when Desire meets opposition. Without conflict, there would be no true desire because anything easily attainable lacks tension or a narrative drive. However, conflict alone cannot drive a story; it needs Desire for movement and Yearning for depth and meaning.

**Summary**:

At the heart of every story lies a character's Desire, which emerges from a sense of something missing or unfulfilled in their life. When external or internal events disrupt a character's status quo, they are driven to act, sparking the narrative's motion. As they journey through the plot, their desires might evolve, reflecting deeper aspirations. While conflict creates necessary tension in the story, it is the thwarted Desire that produces this tension. Ultimately, while conflict can add layers to a narrative, Desire is the true engine that pushes the story forward, giving it purpose and momentum.
### II. DESIRE AND CHANGE
**Summary and Clarification**:

**1. Desire and Change**:
- Stories revolve around change. When something happens to a protagonist, it leads to change, either in circumstances or in the character's understanding.
- The term "character change" covers a broad spectrum, from drastic transformations to subtle shifts in awareness.
- While the protagonist might face a choice due to some event, their decision to act upon it or not defines the story's essence.

**2. External Struggles and Character Change**:
- Not all protagonists need to undergo change. Characters like Hercule Poirot or James Bond don't evolve much. They are admired for their unique abilities and consistency.
- However, protagonists who face primarily external challenges but lack special skills often grow by acquiring those skills.

**3. Inner Transformation Reflects Change**:
- When characters change, it is usually because their experiences have given them a new understanding of themselves or their world.
- This internal change is validated when tested against the external world. For instance, a reformed criminal might face challenges upon release that test their transformation.
- In tragic stories, the realization might come too late, but the newfound awareness signifies a change.

**4. Steadfast Characters**:
- These characters don't drastically change in terms of their beliefs or actions but might shift in emotions, insights, or attitudes.
- Their dramatic arcs are based on their refusal to change, either due to holding onto ideals or avoiding pain.
- Steadfast characters may still undergo shifts in their understanding or appreciation of situations, even if their core beliefs remain unaltered.

**5. Role of Failure in Character Change**:
- Disasters or setbacks prompt characters to reassess their beliefs, motivations, or actions.
- Characters face doubts, fears, and uncertainties as they confront challenges, and how they navigate these feelings leads to growth.
- The process of evaluating and reevaluating one's actions in response to challenges shapes the character's journey.

**6. Love and Change**:
- In modern love stories, the obstacles keeping lovers apart are typically internal.
- To win the love of another, characters often need to change something about themselves or their actions.

**7. Opponents and Secondary Characters**:
- While opponents in stories are often depicted as static, they can change, especially in tales where both sides have legitimate motivations.
- The "double reveal" technique allows both the protagonist and the opponent to gain insights from each other.
- Secondary characters might change depending on their roles and experiences throughout the story.

In essence, stories revolve around change, whether in circumstances or in the characters' perceptions and understandings. The journey of grappling with these changes, especially when faced with challenges, defines the narrative. While some characters remain steadfast, most evolve in some way, informed by their experiences and choices.
### III. LINKING DESIRE TO YEARNING
**SUMMARY AND CLARIFICATION:**

---

**III. Connecting Desire with Deeper Yearning**

Understanding a character's desires is just the starting point. Readers seek to delve deeper into the motivation behind these desires. They wish to comprehend:

- The reasons behind the desire.
- The intensity of this desire.
- The risks the character is willing to undertake.
- The consequences of failure.
- The ripple effect on other characters.

This ties the superficial 'Desire' to a profound 'Yearning'. 

Yearning manifests differently across individuals:

1. Some feel an early "calling", indicating their core identity or purpose.
2. For others, this Yearning becomes clear when they discern a personal mission or vocation.
3. There are those who only grasp their deep Yearning after confronting mortality or significant loss. Such events force introspection, leading to questions about identity, purpose, and the way they lead their lives.

The act of Desire compels the character to take action. This usually disrupts the balance the character had previously established between their deep-seated Yearning and the Resistance they faced. The old equilibrium, which was fitting for past situations, is no longer apt. If the character fails to realize this shift and clings to old habits, they might face dire consequences.

In essence, this segment emphasizes the importance of not just understanding a character's desires but also linking them to their deeper yearnings. The clash between old habits and new challenges enriches the narrative, making the character's journey more compelling for readers.

The text suggests that while superficial desires drive the character's immediate actions, it's their deeper yearnings that provide a richer, more layered understanding of their motivations and challenges.

---

**Summary:**

The text explores how a character's pursuit of their desires and dreams provides insights into their deeper yearnings and how they resist or embrace these yearnings. The journey a character takes in a story, based on their yearnings and resistances, can unfold in various ways:

1. **Yearning clearly understood and embraced:** Characters with a clear sense of purpose and mission. Their journey tests their abilities, not their purpose. Example: Mary Poppins.

2. **Yearning clearly understood but uncertainly embraced:** Characters aware of their dreams but held back by doubts. Their journey forces them to confront their hesitations. Example: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

3. **Yearning clearly understood but shunned:** Characters overwhelmed by their fears, avoiding their true desires. Their journey forces them out of their comfort zones. Example: Brick in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof".

4. **Yearning vaguely understood but clarity sought:** Characters know something is missing but aren't sure what. Their journey helps them discover their true purpose. Example: Patrick Sumner in "The North Water".

5. **Yearning vaguely understood and pursued haphazardly:** Lost characters without clear direction. Their journey is full of missteps but offers growth. Example: Holden Caulfield in "Catcher in the Rye".

6. **Yearning vaguely understood and clarity avoided:** Characters resistant to discovering their true desires. Their journey presents a massive wake-up call. Example: Brandon in the film "Shame".

7. **Yearning misunderstood or mistaken:** Characters misinterpreting their true desires, leading to unfulfilled lives. Their journey forces them to confront their misbeliefs. Example: Javert in "Les Misérables".

8. **Yearning unidentified and unpursued:** Passive characters needing a significant event to ignite their journey. Often, their journey might not lead to significant growth.

The relationship between a character's desire and yearning is highlighted as the "Mirror Effect". A character's pursuit of desire can clarify their yearning, either aligning them with their true self or leading them astray. The type of story - one sparked by opportunity or misfortune - can influence how this dynamic plays out.

In stories initiated by misfortunes, characters often face challenges that echo their internal resistances, pushing them to confront and overcome these barriers. These narratives can range from suspense genres to war stories, where characters are thrust into situations forcing them to adapt or redefine their yearnings.

The overarching theme emphasizes the significance of understanding and pursuing one's true desires and yearnings, as they shape the trajectory of the character's journey and personal growth within a story.

### IV. MOTIVATING THE CHARACTER WHO IS RELUCTANT TO ACT

**Summary & Clarification:**

**IV. Motivating a Reluctant Character to Act**

*Main Points*:
1. At the start of many stories, characters are given a compelling reason to act. However, not all characters feel compelled. Without a strong motivation, a character might remain passive.
2. This lack of motivation can arise throughout the story, particularly when challenges and doubts increase.
3. To motivate the character, one can encourage them to connect with their deep-seated desires or dreams, termed here as "Yearning."
4. Characters might feel stuck when faced with difficult situations or when they desire something but doubt their ability to achieve it. This reluctance can stem from past experiences of avoidance, fear, or trauma.
5. It's vital to distinguish between the character's reluctance and the author's hesitations. A writer's personal fears might inadvertently make the protagonist hesitant.
6. To motivate a reluctant character, one should:
   a. Understand the character's past and reasons for their hesitation.
   b. Push the character by introducing high stakes or presenting an irresistible opportunity.
   c. Emphasize the devastating consequences of inaction or the invaluable gains of action.

7. The motivation to act can also be tied to the character's sense of identity. If an action or decision directly impacts the character's self-concept or the welfare of loved ones, the stakes are even higher.
8. Characters might have to rely on their virtues to act, especially when faced with crises that challenge their weaknesses.
9. There's a distinction between "answering the call" and "rising to the occasion":
   - "Answering the call" relates to characters with a clear sense of purpose and identity. Their actions validate or challenge who they are.
   - "Rising to the occasion" concerns characters reacting more to external circumstances than internal conflicts.
10. The main difference between these two motivations is the source: external pressures vs. internal drives.

### SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN THIS CHAPTER
**Summary of the Chapter:**

1. **Desire as the Driving Force of Story:** Desire is sparked when the status quo of the story world is disturbed, either through the rise of an opportunity or the occurrence of a misfortune. Desire propels characters into action to achieve or avoid something, thus driving the narrative.
 
2. **Conflict and Tension:** Conflict occurs when desire meets opposition. It is essential for a story because it creates tension, leading to the question of whether the character will achieve their desires.

3. **Character Change:** Change is integral to a character's development. While certain genres like mysteries and action stories may not require the protagonist to evolve, many stories depict characters undergoing personal growth, driven by their experiences, challenges, or newfound realizations.

4. **Different Types of Change:** Characters might:
   - Realize their misconceptions too late (tragedy).
   - Be steadfast and refuse to change because of their ideals.
   - Gain a deeper understanding or emotional growth, even if their actions remain the same.

5. **Failure as a Catalyst for Change:** Experiencing failure pushes characters to introspect and reconsider their actions and motivations. It makes them question their limitations and what they need to modify to succeed, leading them closer to their Yearning.

6. **Linking Desire to Yearning:** For a character's motivation to resonate, their main goal (Desire) should reflect their deep-rooted aspirations or Yearning. The character's struggles and failures make them more aware of their true desires and what's preventing them from achieving them. The balance between Yearning (what they long for) and Resistance (what holds them back) dictates their actions and personal growth.

7. **Understanding Yearning:** Yearning is a character's underlying dream or vision of their ideal life. It may be clear or vague, but it serves as a guidepost for the character. The story often aids in clarifying this Yearning, especially through trials and tribulations.

8. **Desire & Yearning in Different Story Starters:** Opportunities in stories resonate with a character's existing longings, while misfortunes challenge a character's strategies to cope with pain. Sometimes, significant disasters forge a fresh horizon of hope for the character.

9. **Motivating Reluctant Characters:** Characters might hesitate to act due to fear or self-doubt. To overcome this, the story can tap into the character's Yearning. The stakes should be high enough to force the character into action, whether through looming danger or a golden opportunity. The action should often align with the character's identity or the welfare of their loved ones.

In essence, this chapter underscores the importance of Desire and Yearning in driving a story forward and facilitating character development. Through trials, failures, and opportunities, characters discover their true selves and what they truly want, creating a dynamic and engaging narrative.

## 7 Weaving a Life

### I. STORY’S THREE-TIER STRUCTURE

### Summary:

**1. Three-tier Structure of a Story:**
   - **Internal Questions:** These delve into the character's self-perception and tackle issues like self-worth, purpose, and integrity.
   - **External Challenges:** These tests reveal a character's abilities by pushing them to achieve a goal despite significant challenges.
   - **Interpersonal Relationships:** This tier focuses on the character's relationships with others. The dynamics can either strengthen or weaken these bonds, and they often straddle both internal perceptions and external interactions.

**2. Significance of Interpersonal Relationships:** 
   - They can elevate the importance of the story's outcome beyond the main character.
   - They can introduce rivalry by having multiple characters pursue the same goal.
   - They foster empathy, as readers tend to care about characters who demonstrate care for others.

**3. Choosing a Dramatic Focus:**
   - Storytellers need to decide which level of dramatic action to emphasize: external, internal, or interpersonal. 
   - **External challenges** usually center on a character's Desire, igniting curiosity about the character's abilities and determination.
   - **Internal and interpersonal challenges** generally stem from the character's Yearning, fostering empathy and evoking emotions in the reader.

**4. Integration of the Tiers:**
   - For a story to be genuinely engaging, all these levels of dramatic action should be interconnected and not isolated from one another.


### II. STORIES THAT CONTAIN ONLY ONE OR TWO STRUGGLE LEVELS

### Summary:

**Levels of Struggle in Stories:**

1. **Traveling Angel Stories**:
   - These are tales where the protagonist, referred to as a "traveling angel", goes from place to place (or situation to situation) to solve problems.
   - The primary changes or lessons are experienced by the characters the protagonist encounters, rather than the protagonist themselves.
   - For instance, the protagonist may assist a grieving family or a town overrun by criminals.
   - In some variations, like "Mary Poppins" or "Amélie", the story revolves around the protagonist’s concern for others. However, their relationships are typically fleeting because they're destined to move on after solving problems.
  
2. **Love Stories**:
   - Not limited to romantic narratives, these encompass profound connections between friends, family members, etc.
   - The main external challenge is to establish or maintain a bond with the loved one.
   - These stories focus primarily on internal and interpersonal struggles, especially when external challenges like rival suitors or societal disapproval are absent.
   - The plot often revolves around characters addressing internal shortcomings to win or preserve the affection of another.

**Hybrids**:
- There are stories like "The Intouchables" that blend elements from both the above categories. Here, a working-class caretaker (the traveling angel archetype) forms a bond of friendship with the man he cares for, leading to mutual growth and transformation.

**Important Point**:
- While "traveling angel" and "love stories" typically emphasize certain struggle levels, they can potentially encompass all three levels (external, internal, and interpersonal). The inclusion of these struggles isn't dictated by the genre but is up to the storyteller's discretion.

### III. INTERWEAVING STRUGGLE LEVELS
### Summary:

**Interweaving Struggle Levels in Stories**:

- **Concept**: When multiple levels of struggle are present in a story, it's vital to integrate them. A solution on one level should impact the others, leading to a cohesive conclusion.
  
- **Importance**: If these struggles run parallel without influencing each other, they can feel disconnected or redundant. For instance, adding unrelated personal problems to a detective's life or using a family member merely as a plot device (like a hostage) can come off as contrived.

- **Two Key Questions**:
   1. **Why Separate Struggles at All?**: Breaking down struggles helps in clearly understanding the different challenges a character faces. Though they are interwoven, distinguishing them initially ensures clarity in character development and conflict. While it's possible for skilled writers to envision these complexities holistically, separating them helps avoid confusion.
   2. **How to Interweave Struggles?**: As a character chases their external goal, they often discover more about themselves, their desires, and their relationships. This journey toward an objective sheds light on their identity, capabilities, and personal aspirations, including their relationships.

In essence, while characters may begin with distinct internal, external, and interpersonal struggles, these threads eventually come together, influencing and complementing each other to provide depth and cohesion to the story.
### IV. USING INTRINSIC LONGINGS TO INTERWEAVE STRUGGLE LEVELS
### Summary:

**Intrinsic Longings and Interweaving Struggle Levels**:

1. **Intrinsic Motivations by Struggle Levels**:
   - **Internal Questions**:
     - Desire for truth, significance, and purpose.
     - Need for personal identity, integrity, and dignity.
     - Craving for self-confidence and self-fulfillment.
   - **External Challenges**:
     - Desire for safety and survival.
     - Need for justice and peace.
     - Craving for adventure, freedom, and power.
   - **Interpersonal Relationships**:
     - Desire to love and be loved.
     - Need for belonging and acceptance.
     - Craving for revenge or retribution.
     - Desire for forgiveness and a second chance.

2. **Interrelation of Struggle Levels**:
   - External goals and interpersonal connections are deeply tied to underlying needs that resonate with the character’s sense of self.
   - These intrinsic desires aren't mutually exclusive; for instance, someone seeking adventure might also be striving for self-realization and identity.

3. **Example Storyline: Rural Fire Chief**:
   - **External Struggle**: Tackling a threatening wildfire and ensuring the safety of townspeople.
   - **Internal Struggle**: Battling self-doubt and redefining personal worth and competence.
   - **Interpersonal Struggle**: Seeking forgiveness and acceptance from the community, especially those affected by his past mistakes.
   - The character’s external actions, internal self-worth, and interpersonal dynamics continuously influence each other throughout the story.

4. **Concept of Yearning Horizon**:
   - The character's overarching desire or "Yearning" is vast and often unfulfillable in a lifetime. However, for storytelling, a "Yearning Horizon" is introduced. It represents a specific, attainable goal within the story that symbolizes a part of the broader Yearning.
   - The Yearning Horizon can manifest in symbolic forms, like literary symbols such as Ahab’s white whale or Gatsby’s green light. But it's always understood that beyond this symbolic horizon lies the larger, unending desire prompting the individual to seek personal growth and a richer life experience.

In essence, memorable characters are shaped by intertwined levels of struggles, driven by deep-seated intrinsic longings. Recognizing and weaving these aspects together can provide a comprehensive narrative tapestry.
### V. INTERWEAVING STRUGGLE LEVELS TWO EXAMPLES

### Summary:

**Interweaving Levels of Struggle in Storytelling: Two Examples**

1. **“THE DEAD” by James Joyce**:
    * **Setting**: An annual Christmas party in Dublin hosted by Kate and Julia Morkan.
    * **Main Characters**: Gabriel Conroy and his wife, Gretta.
    * **External Struggle**: Gabriel needs to deliver a successful speech at the party.
    * **Interpersonal Struggle**: Differences between Gabriel and Gretta regarding their roots and loyalties. Gabriel's urban alignment versus Gretta’s love for the rural west.
    * **Internal Struggle**: Gabriel’s self-doubt, issues of national authenticity, and personal self-worth.
    * **Climax**: Gretta reveals a profound past love, causing Gabriel to confront his insecurities and redefine his life's priorities.
  
2. **Breaking Bad (TV Series)**:
    * **Main Character**: Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned meth manufacturer.
    * **External Struggle**: Walter's endeavor to produce and sell methamphetamine to secure his family’s future.
    * **Interpersonal Struggle**: The impact of Walter’s decisions on his relationships, especially given the secrecy of his activities.
    * **Internal Struggle**: Walter’s evolving identity from a resigned teacher to a dominant criminal mastermind seeking respect and fear.
  
**Analysis**:
    * The external struggle usually drives the plot and is the most evident.
    * Interpersonal conflicts often motivate or influence the external struggle and bring depth to the characters' interactions.
    * The internal struggle gives the story its depth, as it focuses on the character's self-reflection, evolution, and transformative journey.
    * All these levels of struggles are interconnected; each impacts and influences the other. Successful narratives skillfully interweave these levels to create a holistic and emotionally resonant story.

In essence, storytelling becomes profound when the character’s external actions, rooted in interpersonal relationships, lead to internal transformations. It's the harmony of these struggles that shapes the narrative, with each influencing and being influenced by the others.
### SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN THIS CHAPTER

In essence, this chapter underscores the intricate tapestry of narratives, woven through external actions, internal dilemmas, and interpersonal dynamics. Recognizing and balancing these threads can lead to rich, resonant storytelling.

# Part Two - Developing a Deeper Understanding 

## 8 Folly's Footsteps 
### I. INTRODUCTION 
#### Summary:

**Folly’s Footsteps: Misguided Desires and Misbegotten Yearnings**:

1. **Quotes Highlighting the Theme**:
   - Eudora Welty describes the unintentional pull towards desires, which might not align with one's true self.
   - James Baldwin warns about the consequences of yearning too strongly for something.

2. **Introduction**:
   - The interplay between **Yearning** (a character’s deepest wish or dream) and **Resistance** (challenges preventing the realization of that dream) has been previously discussed. 
   - While characters may seem to have clarity about their yearnings, it's not always the case. Many are misguided.

3. **Misguided Desires**:
   - People often misunderstand their own desires. Some are confident yet misguided in their pursuits.
   - Characters may desire something for the wrong reasons or have noble intentions but pursue unsuitable goals.
   - This confusion might result in characters seeking false promises or suffering consequences due to mistaken pursuits.

4. **Revelation & Consequences**:
   - Recognizing one's mistakes can lead to deeper understanding and clearer desires.
   - Conversely, realization might lead to further misjudgments or even complete mistrust in one's instincts. Extreme examples include drastic actions like Oedipus blinding himself.

5. **Role of Resistance**:
   - Resistance intensifies pain (physical or emotional), and this can sometimes distort a character's understanding of their true desires.
   - The pain can make genuine desires seem unrealistic, leading characters to either curb their ambitions or question their own desires.

6. **Limitless Possibilities**:
   - There are countless ways a character might deviate from their true desires. This vast spectrum makes it challenging to list all potential missteps.
   - Examples from various mediums will be provided later in the chapter to demonstrate this concept.

7. **Character Arc Analysis**:
   - The chapter aims to evaluate a prevalent understanding of the character arc in fiction, juxtaposing it with the tension between Yearning and Resistance.
   - The goal is to understand how the character’s journey, faced with internal and external challenges, aligns with core writing concepts.

In essence, this chapter examines the frequent misalignment between what characters believe they desire and their true, deeper yearnings. It explores the factors that contribute to this confusion and how characters navigate these misperceptions within the broader context of storytelling.
### II. A COMMON VIEW OF CHARACTER ARCANALYSIS AND CRITIQUE

### Summary:

**Character Arc Analysis and Critique: A Deeper Dive into Protagonist Evolution**

1. **Character Arc Basics**:
   - The Protagonist starts with a **state of Lack** which is a combination of their desires, frustrations, joys, and pains. This is shaped by the clash between their Yearning (deep desire) and Resistance (fear of change).
   - A triggering event creates a problem they need to address.
   - Due to the state of Lack, the protagonist misunderstands the problem. This error often stems from past wounds or resistance to change.
   - Their flawed understanding leads to missteps, setbacks, and partial successes without solving the core issue.
   - A significant setback forces the protagonist into deep introspection ("dark night of the soul").
   - An insight emerges, revealing their initial misjudgment. Understanding their personal stake in this misconception, they decide on a new approach to tackle the problem.
   - The narrative then pivots from "What needs to be done?" to "Will they succeed?", culminating in the story's climax.

2. **Transformative Insights**:
   - While the protagonist may have several moments of realization, the most pivotal one usually occurs two-thirds or three-quarters into the story.
   - If the protagonist seems to understand the solution but delays action, the narrative tension could drop. Challenges faced by the character should not be repetitive; diversity in obstacles maintains reader engagement.

3. **Behavior vs. Perception**:
   - The standard character arc tends to focus on a character's misconceptions, implying their issues are belief-based.
   - However, characters are multidimensional. Their struggles aren't just about perception; they're deeply rooted in their behaviors and reactions to various situations.
   - A character's issue shouldn't be attributed to just one factor. It should emerge from their entire personality.

4. **Behavioral Evolution**:
   - Misperception should encompass not just how a character thinks but how they act.
   - Changes in behavior—like an introvert offering kindness, a lone wolf joining a group, or an arrogant individual stepping aside for another—can vividly illustrate character development.
   - When constructing character arcs, writers should consider not just their thoughts and feelings but also tangible behavioral shifts. If behavior remains unchanged, understanding why is crucial.
   
5. **The Power of Behavior in Storytelling**:
   - Grounding a character's dilemma in actions, rather than just inner thoughts, offers a broader canvas to depict their journey and transformation.
   - Inner reflections are essential, especially in novels. However, for scripts or drama-centric novels, behavior should be the focal point. This focus not only makes the narrative more engaging but leverages the strengths of the medium.

In essence, while traditional character arcs focus on misconceptions, a comprehensive understanding should encapsulate a character's behavior. It's the interplay of thought, feeling, and action that crafts a compelling, believable character journey.

### III. ILLUMINATIVE EXAMPLES

#### BURIED YEARNING AND MISGUIDED DESIRE LEADING TO TRANSFORMATION
**Summary:**
In this section, the narrative explores the pitfalls of personal desires and the potential consequences of misjudgment. Using various fictional examples, it aims to guide writers on how to incorporate such dilemmas in their works. A detailed analysis of the story of Michael Clayton, a film written and directed by Tony Gilroy, serves as the primary example. 

Michael Clayton, once a respectable litigator, now works as a “fixer” at a leading law firm, assisting in covering up morally questionable acts for the firm and its wealthy clients. He struggles with his own moral compass and a gambling addiction, symbolizing his deeper desire for genuine self-respect and a better identity. The story showcases a series of events, beginning with Clayton dealing with his personal and professional life, notably with a case involving a company called U/North. As the narrative unfolds, Arthur Edens, a colleague of Clayton, uncovers a condemning memo implicating U/North in producing a lethal herbicide to save on retooling expenses. This revelation triggers a series of actions, including Arthur's murder disguised as a suicide, to cover up the company's misdeeds. 

Throughout the story, Michael's identity and morality are consistently questioned, especially as he faces his own personal demons. The climax occurs when Michael almost gets killed in a car explosion, an attempt by U/North to silence him permanently. This near-death experience catalyzes a transformation in Michael, forcing him to reassess his values, priorities, and the path he's been walking on. The narrative questions whether Michael will finally confront the corruption around him and strive for righteousness.

#### WHEN CRISIS FORGES A NEW DREAM OF LIFE
**Summary:**

Crisis, such as illness or injury, can drastically change an individual's life perspective. Sometimes, these seemingly devastating events pave the way for personal growth and a newfound appreciation for life. Real-life examples like athlete Wilma Rudolph highlight the resilience some individuals display despite facing health challenges and societal barriers. Cinema, too, portrays this narrative. In "The Doctor," a surgeon's life is turned upside down when he is diagnosed with cancer, forcing him to confront his past behaviors and grow as a person. "Regarding Henry" follows a similar theme, where a lawyer experiences a dramatic shift in his worldviews after suffering serious injuries during a robbery. Both characters undergo significant transformations in their personalities and values due to the shocking events they face. However, not every story ends positively. For instance, "Good Morning, Midnight" depicts a woman's spiral into despair following traumatic events in her life. While crises can lead to profound self-reflection and change, they can also engulf individuals in overwhelming grief and sorrow.

#### THE TRUE YEARNING BURIED, REPLACED BY A FALSE, SELF-CREATED ONE
**Summary:**

"Midnight Cowboy" is a story that explores the complexities of self-worth, identity, and human connection. Joe Buck grows up with a distorted view of love and value, due to being abandoned by three women in his life and being raised by a superficial grandmother, Sally Buck, who taught him that appearances are everything. As a result, Joe has issues with abandonment and seeks affection to validate his worth. After his grandmother's death and several disappointments in life, Joe, desperate for control and validation, becomes a hustler in New York, reimagining himself as the "Midnight Cowboy," a symbol of revenge against those who used him in the past. In the city, he meets Ratso, a street-savvy individual with health problems, and the two form a unique bond. Their relationship becomes the center of the story, showcasing the interplay between their respective weaknesses and flaws. Joe's journey towards self-realization involves recognizing the emptiness of his hustler identity and yearning for genuine human connection. However, just as he embraces this truth, he faces the ultimate loss when Ratso dies, leaving him to grapple with the raw pain of abandonment and the pursuit of authenticity.
#### YEARNING RECOGNIZED, BUT IT EVOLVES THROUGH THE CHARACTER'S STRUGGLES
**Summary and Clarification:**

The discussion revolves around how the progression of a character's journey in a narrative can lead to an evolving understanding of their deepest desires and yearnings, which is often a result of external challenges and shifting circumstances. This process helps ground characters more realistically, as opposed to conforming them to a pre-determined mold.

Two examples are cited:

1. **A Prophet**: This film showcases the protagonist's changing goals and understanding of identity based on his growing confidence and capabilities.

2. **The Hunger Games Trilogy**:
    - **Background**: The story is set in the dystopian nation of Panem, where the government organizes an annual event called the Hunger Games. This event is a fight to the death among children, and serves both as a reminder of the government's power and as entertainment for the Capitol.
    - **Katniss Everdeen**: The protagonist, initially described as a skilled huntress who volunteers for the games to save her younger sister. Her identity evolves throughout the story, influenced by her experiences and the actions she takes.
    - **Plot Overview**:
        - Katniss and Peeta, another participant, form an alliance in the games. The government frequently changes rules, aiming to create a more engaging show and to manipulate outcomes.
        - Katniss's actions in the games inadvertently spark a rebellion against the oppressive government. Post-games, she becomes a symbol for the rebellion.
        - As the story progresses, Katniss grapples with her public image, interpersonal relationships, and the true nature of leadership within the rebellion.
        - The climax sees a devastating attack that results in the death of Katniss's sister. Katniss learns that the attack was orchestrated by the rebel leader, leading her to kill both the leader and the tyrannical President Snow.
        - The story concludes with Katniss returning to her home district, now scarred and disillusioned but finding solace and love with Peeta.
    - **Character Evolution**: Katniss's journey is complex. Her external goals shift frequently, from saving her sister, to surviving the games, to supporting and later opposing the rebellion. Her internal yearnings similarly evolve, from a fierce independence to a deeper understanding of collective and personal responsibilities. Unlike many protagonists, her choices are based on her evolving understanding of what is right, not on internal misperceptions.

In conclusion, both narratives demonstrate how characters' external struggles and experiences can redefine their internal desires, beliefs, and identities, leading to rich and dynamic storytelling.
#### YEARNING APPREHENDED, BUT WITH NO CLEAR IDEA HOW TO FULFILL IT
**Summary and Clarification**:

The narrative centers around characters who become aware of a deep yearning or longing early on in the story. While they recognize this desire, the path to fulfilling it remains unclear. The complexity lies in understanding the steps to take, recognizing the obstacles, gauging the difficulty of the journey, and determining what success would even look like.

**The Man Who Gave Up His Name by Jim Harrison**:

- **Protagonist**: The story revolves around Nordstrom (nicknamed “North Storm”), a former corporate employee, who is awakened to the idea that he needs to change after being called a “cold fish” by his daughter.
  
- **Journey**: The narrative chronicles Nordstrom's attempts to reshape his life and mindset. These efforts are not straightforward and involve deep introspection. Major life events, such as a divorce, leaving his job, and the death of his father, compel him to reflect on his past and how he became the man he is.

- **Resolution**: After various experiences, Nordstrom finds himself working as a short-order cook in Florida. A seemingly mundane moment of dancing joyously after work hours, first with colleagues and then alone, symbolizes his realization. He understands that personal fulfillment isn't necessarily about ambition, but about acceptance, finding contentment in life's simple moments, and having the courage to find happiness, even in solitude.

In essence, the narrative encapsulates the journey of a man who, upon recognizing a void in his life, embarks on a path of self-discovery and transformation, ultimately realizing that true contentment can be found in acceptance and cherishing solitary moments of joy.
#### THE DREAM UNREALIZED, FOLLOWED BY A DESCENT INTO NIGHTMARE 
**Summary and Clarification**:

David Hare’s work, "Plenty," revolves around the life of Susan Traherne, a young British woman who, during her teenage years, ardently served as a courier for the French Resistance during World War II. The play and its subsequent film adaptation delve into Susan's post-war life and the disillusionment that ensues.

**Main Points**:

- **Backdrop**: At 17, Susan Traherne is fervently working behind enemy lines. Her wartime experiences provide her with a strong sense of purpose and self-worth.

- **Post-War Expectations**: Once the war concludes, Susan is filled with optimism for the future. She anticipates a world renewed with vigor and promise after the Allies' victory.

- **Sense of Entitlement**: Susan's wartime contributions make her feel deserving of this promising future. This entitlement becomes her weakness as she adopts a superior attitude and fails to take personal responsibility in creating the world she envisioned.

- **Downward Spiral**: Susan's post-war reality doesn't align with her expectations. The colorless monotony of peace contrasts sharply with the vibrancy of her wartime memories. Her life becomes a series of unfulfilling jobs and relationships. This drift into meaninglessness, coupled with her existing flaws, leads her into depression and bitterness.

- **Attempts to Rekindle the Past**: Susan marries a diplomat, not out of love, but for the potential opportunities his job might offer. She hopes to rekindle some sense of purpose through a brief encounter with a former wartime colleague, but he too falls short of her expectations.

- **Conclusion**: The radiant promise Susan felt during the war fades, replaced by a gnawing sense of entitlement and deep-rooted disillusionment. This resentment becomes so overwhelming that it ultimately consumes not only her relationships but also her very essence.

In essence, "Plenty" is a poignant narrative about the challenges of transitioning from a life of intense purpose and clarity during wartime to the often bleak and undefined landscape of post-war existence. Susan's journey, marked by hope, disillusionment, and self-destruction, underscores the complexities of human emotions and expectations.

#### INCOMPATIBLE YEARNINGS 
**Summary and Clarification**:

In the Showtime TV series "Homeland", the central character, Carrie Mathison, grapples with a profound internal conflict: her inherent passion and talent for espionage versus her responsibilities and aspirations as a mother.

**Main Points**:

- **Character Profile**: Carrie Mathison is a dedicated CIA case officer, described as a "born spy." Her childhood courage earns her the nickname "Little Daredevil," and as an adult, she excels in her challenging career due to her persistent virtues and inherent yearning for the role. However, her assertiveness occasionally borders on arrogance and defiance, which, along with her bipolar personality disorder, sometimes jeopardizes her professional endeavors.

- **Bipolar Disorder**: At 22, Carrie is diagnosed with this mental illness. The demanding nature of her job, with its immense pressures and stresses, often exacerbates her symptoms, particularly during her manic episodes. Here, she becomes obsessive and tends to draw connections that others miss. While this intuition can be an asset when she's right, it also threatens her credibility when she's wrong.

- **Professional and Personal Tug-of-War**: Carrie's mentor, Saul Berenson, sees her value but is also deeply concerned about her well-being. Carrie's family, aware of her aptitude for espionage, fears the job may be worsening her condition. This concern intensifies when Carrie becomes pregnant and decides to prioritize motherhood, finding new purpose and meaning in this role. Yet, the world of espionage keeps pulling her back.

- **Parenting Struggles**: Carrie's obsession with her intelligence work often results in her neglecting her daughter, Frannie. This recurring negligence leads her sister, Maggie, to file for sole custody. The series highlights Carrie's moral struggle in acknowledging the harm she's causing Frannie and understanding her motivations for wanting to raise her – a mix of maternal instinct, vanity, and guilt.

- **Resolution**: Maggie eventually urges Carrie to follow her true calling in the world of espionage, assuring her that she will take care of Frannie. This duality in Carrie's yearning – her love and responsibility towards her daughter versus her innate drive for espionage – introduces continuous tension throughout the series.

- **Audience Feedback**: While this internal conflict added depth to Carrie's character, some critics and viewers felt it detracted from the primary appeal of the series: Carrie's espionage work compounded by her mental health issues. The repeated scenes depicting her lapses as a parent became somewhat redundant over time.

In essence, "Homeland" intricately portrays a character torn between two incompatible yearnings, illustrating the complexities and challenges of balancing personal desires with societal and familial expectations.
#### THE DREAM OF VENGEANCE
**Summary and Clarification**:

"The Limey" is a tale of revenge that delves into the complexities of moral codes, regret, and self-discovery. 

**Main Points**:

- **Revenge's Futility**: Although the aphorism about digging two graves before seeking revenge is misattributed to Confucius, it encapsulates the theme of the movie — that vengeance often consumes the seeker, and its attainment doesn't necessarily lead to satisfaction or redemption.

- **Plot Overview**: The protagonist, Wilson, an ex-convict from England, travels to LA to investigate his daughter Jenny's mysterious death, initially ruled as an automobile accident. Wilson zeroes in on Terry Valentine, Jenny's boyfriend and a former music producer turned drug trafficker. Valentine becomes Wilson's primary suspect, leading to a violent confrontation between the two parties.

- **Wilson's Backstory**: As Wilson delves deeper into the investigation, he reveals his past criminal activities, which strained his relationship with Jenny. She often tried to prevent him from committing crimes, fearing his incarceration. Her attempts to save her father culminated in an eventual separation when he was jailed.

- **Truth Unveiled**: When Wilson confronts Valentine, he learns that Valentine accidentally killed Jenny during a heated argument about Valentine's drug dealings. She threatened to expose him, a parallel to her interactions with her father. To hide Valentine's role in Jenny's death, Avery, Valentine's security chief, staged it as a car accident.

- **Self-Realization**: Wilson's desire for revenge fades as he realizes the uncanny similarities between his past actions with Jenny and her fatal confrontation with Valentine. He recognizes that Jenny's attempts to save Valentine mirrored her past efforts to save him. Wilson decides not to kill Valentine, instead returning to England, consumed with regret.

- **Dream of Life**: The movie suggests that the pursuit of revenge can sometimes be a quest for identity and meaning. While Wilson seeks to avenge his daughter's death (Desire), his actions reflect a moral code he identifies with (Yearning). His journey forces him to confront the balance between his virtues, such as loyalty and courage, and his flaws, including his criminal past and indifference to others' suffering. Ultimately, the hunt for his daughter's killer becomes a profound journey of self-discovery, culminating in his realization of the futility of vengeance and his role in the tragic events.

In essence, "The Limey" portrays the convoluted path of revenge, where the lines between right and wrong blur, and the seeker often discovers more about themselves than about the object of their vengeance.
#### FORSAKING A DREAM IMPOSED BY ANOTHER FOR ONE'S OWN
**Summary and Clarification**:

"The Fighter" by Craig Davidson tells the intertwined stories of two young men, Paul Harris and Rob Tully, who grapple with identities imposed upon them by family expectations. Their journeys are marked by violence and self-destruction as they search for self-definition.

**Main Points**:

- **Paul Harris' Background**: Born to affluent vineyard owners, Paul lives a life of comfort. His privileged existence makes him aimless, symbolizing his lack of self-direction (Weakness). After a brutal beating from a man he insulted, he undergoes a metamorphosis. Opting to work in the fields rather than the plush comforts of the wine company, he also takes up boxing. Inspired by tales of itinerant fighters, he decides to define himself as a "fighter" rather than a "boxer" (Yearning).

- **Rob Tully's Background**: A naturally gifted young boxer, Rob trains under the guidance of his father, Reuben, and uncle Tommy. Both men, former boxers themselves, have high hopes for Rob's future, aiming for the Olympics and a professional boxing career. Rob's intrinsic lack of a "killer instinct" in the ring is evident, but he continues to box to fulfill his family's dream rather than his own (Misguided Yearning/Mistaken Desire).

- **Catalyst**: Paul, in his pursuit of becoming a wandering brawler, faces off with Tommy in an underground fight. A fortuitous punch from Paul gravely injures Tommy, leading him into a coma he never awakens from. Out of revenge, Rob challenges Paul to a match, which culminates in a brutal display of violence. Paul accepts this punishment, enduring Rob's relentless assault until he's rendered unconscious and critically wounded.

- **Self-Destruction**: Unable to cope with the ferocity he displayed, Rob violently shatters his own hands against a fence post, ensuring he can never box again. His father later expresses deep regret for pushing Rob towards boxing. Paul, recovering from the injuries sustained during his fight with Rob, heads to Thailand to participate in even more dangerous underground matches, signaling his acceptance of a path that will eventually lead to his death.

- **Thematic Exploration**: Both young men strive for authenticity and self-definition (Yearning). Paul, previously adrift in luxury, now seeks purpose through physical pain and fighting. Rob, bound by family expectations, ultimately rebels against his imposed destiny. For both, violent physical harm serves as a means to break free from their preordained paths. 

In essence, "The Fighter" delves deep into the challenges of self-identity, familial expectations, and the drastic lengths individuals might go to define or redefine themselves.
#### THE ECSTATIC YEARNING GIVING WAY TO MADNESS
**Summary and Clarification**:

The excerpt explores the thin line between ecstatic religious experiences and madness, as depicted in Peter Shaffer’s play "Equus" and Ingmar Bergman’s film "Through a Glass Darkly". These works highlight how profound yearnings for divine connection, when mixed with internal anxieties, can lead to horrifying results.

**Main Points**:

1. **Background**: In the Middle Ages, determining the nature of an individual’s divine visions or voices was vital. The divine encounters often involved terror, but such moments were followed by a clear mission. Characters who acted upon such divinely-inspired missions often faced extreme challenges but remained resolute. However, what happens when the vision is overwhelmingly terrifying and offers no clear path?

2. **Equus**: 
   - Alan Strang, a patient of therapist Martin Dysart, has an erotic fascination with horses. 
   - After a failed sexual encounter near the stables, he believes the horses, perceived as godlike beings, are watching him. 
   - Overwhelmed by fear, he blinds the horses.

3. **Through a Glass Darkly**: 
   - Karin, diagnosed with schizophrenia, grapples with her perceived reality versus the real world.
   - Various triggers like the sound of a foghorn and reading her father's notes about her condition cause her to act out erratically, including seducing her younger brother.
   - She believes she will witness God when she sees a spider emerging from a wall crack. She is later consumed by her visions and believes she's seen the face of God, represented by the spider.

4. **Underlying Theme**: Both Alan and Karin have intense desires to connect with a greater power, but their yearnings mask deeper anxieties, particularly related to sexuality. When these yearnings are not properly understood or misdirected, they can lead to horrifying outcomes.

5. **Comparison to Joe Buck**: Unlike Alan and Karin, Joe Buck from "Midnight Cowboy" has the strength to confront his true desires, demonstrating how a misperception of one's needs can be harmful.

6. **Purpose of the Chapter**: The examples in the chapter illustrate the various ways characters can be misled by their desires or deeper yearnings, emphasizing that these misconceptions manifest through tangible actions.

In summary, the exploration revolves around the idea that intense spiritual or divine yearnings, when intermixed with personal anxieties and misperceptions, can lead to tragic and devastating outcomes. The characters' misguided desires and profound longings drive them to actions that can be both dangerous and self-destructive.
### IV. MORAL DILEMMAS AND DREAM-KILLING CHOICES
**Summary and Clarification**:

The passage delves deep into the concept of moral dilemmas in storytelling, emphasizing on how they force characters to confront excruciating decisions and thus revealing their true nature.

**Key Concepts**:

1. **Moral Dilemmas & Choices**:
    - Moral dilemmas compel characters to decide between two or more conflicting choices, both of which can have dire consequences. These choices can reveal unexpected facets of a character's nature.

4. **Types of Dilemmas**:
    - **Lesser of Two Evils**: The choice is between two bad options, but one is noticeably less terrible.
    - **Necessary Evil**: The choices are morally compromising, potentially leaving permanent scars on the character's conscience.
    - **Between a Rock and a Hard Place**: The character faces two equally devastating options.
    - **Cornelian Dilemma**: The character must choose between personal honor and another deeply held value or desire.
    - **Double Bind**: A long-term situation where a character receives conflicting messages, often leading to paralysis or severe emotional distress.

5. **The Four Steps of Dilemma**:
    - **Presentation of Options**: Unveiling the choices.
    - **Deliberation**: The character's internal struggle over which choice to make.
    - **The Choice**: The character's decision.
    - **Consequences**: The aftermath of the decision.

6. **Impact Levels**:
    - Decisions impact a character **internally** (identity and morals), **interpersonally** (relationships), and **externally** (situational consequences).

7. **Maximizing the Effect of Dilemmas**:
    - To heighten the narrative tension:
        - Make options clear but devastating.
        - Shorten the decision-making time.
        - Highlight profound consequences.
        - Amplify the impact on the character's core beliefs and relationships.

In essence, the passage explores the narrative power of moral dilemmas in literature. By forcing characters to make near-impossible choices, authors can delve deep into the character's psyche, providing readers with a gripping and emotionally-charged experience.
### SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN THIS CHAPTER
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Chapter's Main Points**:

1. **Character’s Yearning**:
   - In some stories, characters have a clear, defined goal or yearning.
   - In others, the character is uncertain or confused about what they desire.
   - This confusion might lead them to pursue false objectives, only to realize their mistake later, which can then lead to deeper understanding, another misguided pursuit, or a loss of trust in their own instincts.

2. **Influence of Resistance**:
   - Forces of resistance may distort an individual's belief in a promising life. They could be internal conflicts, external factors, or past traumas that prevent a character from achieving their yearning.

3. **Standard Character Arc Analysis**:
   - The character begins with a "Lack," a combination of ambitions and frustrations.
   - An event causes the character to act, often based on their initial misunderstanding.
   - The protagonist then makes multiple errors before a major failure pushes them to a revelation.
   - This revelation prompts a change in strategy, allies, or personal growth, leading up to the climax.

4. **Misunderstanding in Character Arc**:
   - Standard arcs tend to focus on conceptual errors.
   - But real problems stem from behavior, not just thinking.
   - The character's issues often arise from past traumas, forming Persistent Virtues and Pathological Maneuvers.
   - This isn't just a simple misperception; it's a complex pattern of behavior.
   - Behavioral change is crucial in character arcs as it's more observable and impactful.

5. **Moral Dilemmas**:
   - Characters face situations where they must make devastating choices.
   - These dilemmas follow four stages: Presentation of Options, Deliberation, Choice, and Consequences.
   - Characters grapple with challenges on three planes: Internal (personal emotions and morals), Interpersonal (relationships), and External (worldly consequences).
   - The potential consequences should be maximized for impact.

6. **Types of Dilemmas**:
   - **Lesser of Two Evils**: Choosing between two bad options.
   - **Necessary Evil**: Making a morally compromising decision for a perceived greater good.
   - **Caught Between a Rock and a Hard Place**: Choosing between two equally distressing choices.
   - **Cornelian Dilemma**: A choice between personal values and a treasured relationship.
   - **Double Bind**: Being in a situation with conflicting obligations.

7. **Maximizing the Impact**:
   - Dilemmas should have clear, demanding options.
   - Consequences should be grave, potentially harming those the character loves.
   - Shorten decision-making time for increased tension.
   - Every choice made should have a significant impact, changing the character's moral compass or personal value.

**In Essence**: 
This chapter discusses the intricacies of character development, focusing on their desires, influences from past traumas, and the moral dilemmas they face. Through these challenges, characters undergo transformations, making decisions that shape their futures and the narrative's direction. By effectively designing and presenting these dilemmas, writers can significantly enhance the depth and impact of their stories.
## 9 Force of Evil 
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**: 
**Death Wishes, Malignant Hearts, and Summoning the Apocalypse**

**Main Points**:

1. **Yearning's Misinterpretation**:
   - It's a misconception that every character's Yearning or inner desire always stems from a positive or virtuous place. This might be an oversimplified take on the psychoanalytic concept of 'individuation', which implies a natural inclination towards integration, completeness, and overall well-being.
   - However, the reality is more multifaceted, and not everyone pursues universally positive or altruistic goals.

2. **Misunderstood Yearning**:
   - The previous chapter tackled characters who misinterpret their Yearning. They might be misled about what truly matters or have been forced away from their genuine desires. While they might choose an alternate path due to these misconceptions or pressures, their basic hope or determination for a positive outcome still exists, albeit in a misguided form.

3. **Characters Desiring Pain and Chaos**:
   - This chapter shifts its focus to a more extreme type of character—those who genuinely desire pain, destruction, chaos, or harm, either for themselves or for others. Such desires might arise from a need to escape deep-seated personal afflictions or from a yearning for power that seems truly meaningful.
   - These characters are not merely oppositional figures; they actively understand and willingly choose their transgressive actions and intentions.

4. **Terminology Preference**:
   - The author prefers the terms “protagonist” and “opponent” over “hero” and “villain.” However, given this chapter's focus on characters with malevolent intentions, the term "villain" is deemed fitting.

**In Essence**:
This segment delves into the darker side of character motivations. Not all characters are driven by positive or virtuous aspirations. Some genuinely desire harm, chaos, or destruction. The chapter aims to explore the psychology and motivations of such characters, aptly termed "villains", who willingly choose paths of transgression.
### I. ARE VILLAINS BORN OR MADE?
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**:
**Villains: Nature vs. Nurture and the Psychology Behind Their Actions**

**Main Points**:

1. **Dark Triad of Personality Disorders**:
   - Many writers are tempted to label villains with the "Dark Triad" of personality disorders: 
     * **Narcissism**: Defined by grandiosity, egotism, and a lack of empathy.
     * **Machiavellianism**: Defined by manipulation, a disregard for morality, and self-interest.
     * **Psychopathy**: Defined by antisocial behavior, impulsivity, selfishness, and remorselessness.

2. **Danger of Labeling**:
   - Simply labeling a character can be detrimental, leading to a lack of depth and complexity. Instead of understanding the character, it becomes a judgment, confining them to a restrictive mold.
   - Such labeling risks making characters seem like mere automatons driven by a predefined condition rather than conscious beings with their own motivations.

3. **Yearning and Justification**:
   - To give characters depth, they must have an internal narrative or Yearning that justifies their actions. They should be seen as conscious entities with desires, dreams, and reasons, rather than simply being products of their conditions.

4. **Affliction and Despair**:
   - Simone Weil's term "affliction" describes the devastating experiences of prolonged and severe suffering, such as abuse, torture, and war.
   - Such intense suffering can destroy an individual’s capacity for love and hope, thrusting them into darkness and despair, making them perceive escape as impossible.
   - This profound suffering has been observed in the histories of many violent offenders, manifesting not just as inherent evil but as the result of unimaginable victimization.

5. **Loss of Humanity**:
   - The memoir “A Place to Stand” illustrates how continuous punishment and incarceration can turn hopes of freedom into desires for vengeance and dominance. Such experiences can replace an individual's original Yearning or "dream of life" with a more malicious one.

6. **Dystopian Villains and Apocalyptic Visions**:
   - Some villains desire not just the destruction of individuals but the complete annihilation of the current world order.
   - Such characters might believe that only through total devastation can goodness be reborn.
   - The motivation behind these actions is often a deep-seated feeling of impotence, hopelessness, and vulnerability. They feel that, in order to restore hope, everything must be razed to the ground.

**In Essence**:
Villains are complex characters driven by more than mere malevolence. Labeling them under specific disorders limits their depth and richness. Instead, their motivations, often rooted in trauma, suffering, or a deep-seated Yearning, need to be understood. Some villains, shaped by unbearable experiences, even seek the annihilation of the entire world as a form of purification.
### II. MORAL ARGUMENT: MORALITY—AND IMMORALITY—AS MOTIVE
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**:
**Exploring the Motive Behind Morality and Immorality in Characters**

**Main Points**:

1. **Yearning & Morality**:
    - An individual's yearning suggests a moral code. However, what one person considers worth living might not be beneficial for everyone, leading to self-interest merging with immorality.
  
2. **Degrees of Immorality**:
    - There's a difference between believing one matters more than others and believing others don’t matter at all.
  
3. **Moral Justifications by Notorious Villains**:
    - **Harry Lime in The Third Man**: Argues that strife and calamity forge greatness, using this to justify his unethical actions.
    - **Noah Cross in Chinatown**: Believes that great men focus on grand achievements without getting caught up in the consequences.
    - **The Joker in The Dark Knight**: Presents two arguments: one, that most people are self-interested and would betray others; and two, that his actions result in chaos, which he views as "fair."

4. **Counterarguments**:
    - **Against Harry Lime**: Greatness arising during upheavals doesn't necessarily mean calamities cause greatness. Deliberately harming children for profit lacks nobility.
    - **Against Noah Cross**: The future doesn't necessitate cruelty. Objectifying human life is inherently wrong as no one sees themselves as mere objects.
    - **Against The Joker**: Life isn't just a joke; its meaning is something we craft throughout our lives. Believing all humans are corrupt is a flawed generalization. Chaos being "fair" overlooks that it benefits those with power.

5. **Importance of a Strong Moral Argument for Villains**:
    - Giving villains strong, logical justifications for their actions makes them more believable and, paradoxically, more frightening.

6. **Battle of Moral Visions**:
    - A battle between characters over differing moral arguments elevates the narrative, turning it into a larger clash between contrasting worldviews and the potential consequences for their respective societies.

**In Essence**:
While villains may have their moral justifications, these can be countered with strong opposing views. The inclusion of such philosophical battles enriches the narrative, making characters more layered and the story's stakes higher.
### III. DIABOLICAL DISTINCTIONS

#### OPAQUE VS. TRANSPARENT
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**: **Diabolical Distinctions: Opaque vs. Transparent Villainous Motivations**

**Key Points**:

1. **Opaque vs. Transparent Motivations**:
   - The distinction revolves around how much of the villain's motivations are revealed to the audience. Opaque villains have unclear motivations while transparent villains have their motivations explicitly detailed.

2. **Examples of Opaque Villains - Shakespeare's Characters**:
   - *Iago* from "Othello": His deep malevolence is only superficially tied to being overlooked for a promotion. His further deceit and manipulation indicate a profound malevolence.
   - *Richard III*: Despite being disfigured (historically diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis), Richard's deep-seated villainy isn't justified by this physical ailment. He is inherently evil and admits to wanting to prove himself as a villain.
   - These characters often engage the audience by breaking the fourth wall or speaking directly to them.

3. **Modern Opaque Example**:
   - *Frank Underwood* from the TV series "House of Cards" uses direct engagement with the audience, similar to Richard III.

4. **Transparent Villains - Clearly Defined Motivations**:
   - *Francis Dolarhyde* in "Red Dragon": His backstory includes severe childhood abuse, which evolves into sadistic tendencies in adulthood. He also identifies with the "Red Dragon" from a William Blake painting, taking his monstrous identity to a profound level.

5. **Victim Selection in Transparent Villains**:
   - Transparent villains might select victims as symbolic representations of their past tormentors or as a means to erase memories of their own victimhood.

6. **Choosing Between Opaque and Transparent**:
   - The choice between opaque and transparent villainy should be based on the desired impact on the narrative and the audience's experience.

In essence, the distinction between opaque and transparent villain motivations offers writers two unique paths: keeping motivations mysterious to deepen audience engagement or revealing backstories to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the character's wickedness.
#### EVIL INCARNATE VS. FATALLY HUMAN
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**: **Evil Incarnate vs. Fatally Human: The Nature of Villains**

**Key Points**:

1. **Deciding on the Villain's Nature**:
   - Deciding whether to humanize a villain or not largely depends on how one wishes the audience to perceive the character. A purely evil villain can provide a more satisfying, cathartic climax, while a humanized villain might evoke unsettling empathy.

2. **Evil Incarnate Villains**:
   - These villains embody pure malevolence and cruelty. They aim not just for their own gain, but to ensure others suffer devastating losses.
   - Their actions often contrast sharply with the goodness and merit of their victims.

3. **Humanized Villains**:
   - This approach blurs the line between the hero and the villain. 
   - By seeing the negative qualities in the villain that she might need to overcome him, the hero often recognizes those same qualities within herself. This recognition challenges the hero to harness those qualities without becoming immoral.
   
4. **Case Study - 'Heat' (1995)**:
   - Neil McCauley, a sophisticated thief, and Lt. Vincent Hanna, a detective, showcase a balance between hero and villain. Their differences lie in their values and relationships, with Hanna valuing human connection more than McCauley.
   - As the story unfolds, both characters revert to their true nature, with Hanna showcasing commitment and McCauley choosing solitude.

5. **Traits to Counteract the Villain**:
   - The hero might need to employ virtues like honesty, integrity, courage, and intelligence to rally support, which then becomes a source of strength against the villain.

6. **Humanized Villains - Insight and Change**:
   - Humanizing a villain can pose questions about the villain's self-awareness and potential for change. 
   - Even if a villain has the capacity for change, they might not necessarily choose to act on it. A story that captures this moral complexity suggests that the evil in the world is a human trait.

In essence, the portrayal of villains as either embodiments of pure evil or complex, human characters with moral dilemmas, adds depth and dimension to a story. The choice between the two largely determines the audience's emotional journey and engagement with the narrative.
#### DEVIL VS MONSTER
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**: **Devil vs. Monster: Distinct Types of Villains**

**Key Points**:

1. **The Satanic Villain**:
    - Originates from the portrayal of Lucifer in *Paradise Lost*. Iconic villains following this archetype display cunning, cruelty, and magnificence.
    - Often depicted with aristocratic backgrounds, wealth, and a sense of Old World decadence. Examples include Count Dracula and Hannibal Lecter.
    - Characterized by profound self-awareness, a sense of superiority, and a desire to dominate rather than destroy. Their motives stem from pride and ambition, echoing the sentiment, "Better to reign in Hell than serve in heaven."
    - While they often possess an alluring sensuality, this is not a strict rule.

2. **The Beast-like Villain**:
    - Driven more by uncontrollable impulses than by a grand scheme. They often lack the insight and self-awareness of their satanic counterparts.
    - Historically, such villains have been depicted as lower-class, tying into negative stereotypes of these classes being 'bestial' or 'uncivilized'. Examples include Bill Sykes from *Oliver Twist* and Henry Drax from *The North Water*.
    - Their power lies in their unwavering commitment to their purpose due to their inability to consciously control their actions.

3. **Pairings of Satanic and Beast-like Villains**:
    - Fiction frequently pairs these two types of villains, creating a dynamic duo where one serves as the mastermind (satanic villain) and the other as the muscle (beast-like villain).
    - Bond films often utilize this pairing, like Auric Goldfinger with Oddjob, or Karl Stromberg with Jaws.
    - Fantasy genres employ similar dynamics, such as Sauron and the Orcs in *The Lord of the Rings* or Cersei Lannister and Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane in *A Game of Thrones*.

4. **Avoiding Simplification**:
    - While this pairing offers writers the flexibility to showcase a wide spectrum of villainy, it's crucial to avoid making the characters one-dimensional or cartoonish. Intelligence shouldn't be exclusive to the leader, nor should physical strength be confined to the henchman.

In essence, the distinctions between the devil-like mastermind and the monstrous brute in literature provide diverse dynamics and layers to narratives. However, care should be taken to avoid falling into stereotypical traps, ensuring that each character retains depth and nuance.
#### PSYCHOPATH (PATHOLOGICALINDIVIDUALISM) VS. SOCIOPATH (DEFIANT INDIVIDUALISM)
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**: **Psychopath vs. Sociopath: Individualism in Context**

**Key Points**:

1. **Psychopath (Pathological Individualism)**:
    - Psychopaths have an organic personality disorder rooted in a distorted sense of self-interest.
    - Their actions stem from "pathological individualism." They are solely self-directed, acting without remorse and showing no concern for others' well-being. Their primary aim is to serve their interests, regardless of the consequences.

2. **Sociopath (Defiant Individualism)**:
    - Sociopaths, while displaying traits of callousness and lack of remorse similar to psychopaths, differ in that their actions are driven by allegiance to a specific group.
    - This type of behavior is termed "defiant individualism." Members of criminal gangs, terrorist cells, and organized crime exemplify this, acting in the interests of their group rather than just themselves.
    - An illustration is the Chechenskaya bratva in Russia. Rooted in the image of the "Caucasus Robin Hood," they view their criminal activities as a form of vengeance against oppressive forces, especially against the Russian regime. Their actions, while violent, are seen as a means to aid the less fortunate or target rivals.
    - For sociopaths, there's a dual perspective: they view the external world as hostile, but believe that being part of a group enhances their chances of success. This leads to an internal moral code for members that emphasizes loyalty, courage, and some degree of selflessness. Their actions toward those outside the group are only curtailed if it might harm the group's interests.
    - Actions, like killing police officers, might be prohibited not because of the inherent wrong but because of the potential backlash from law enforcement.

3. **Contrast**:
    - While psychopaths are utterly self-centered, sociopaths blend a sense of general injustice with group loyalty, using this combination to justify any harm they inflict on others.

In essence, both psychopaths and sociopaths exhibit a lack of remorse in their actions, but the key difference lies in their motivations. Psychopaths are driven by pure self-interest, whereas sociopaths' actions are influenced by a commitment to a group and a sense of broader injustice. It's vital for portrayals in fiction to capture this distinction to provide an accurate representation.
### IV. THE VILLAIN IN SECRET SEARCH OF PUNISHMENT
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**: **The Villain Seeking Subconscious Punishment**

**Key Points**:

1. **Concept Introduction**:
    - While most villains actively seek success in their malevolent actions, some subconsciously desire to be caught or punished. This internal tug-of-war is characterized by a conscious yearning to commit criminal activities and an underlying desire for justice or punishment.

2. **Underlying Motivations**:
    - This contradictory behavior stems from an inner longing for authenticity or a redemption journey. Characters, plagued by self-contempt, may engage in wrongdoings, believing that a long path of self-destruction will purify them and potentially lead to change.

3. **Examples**:
    - **Raskolnikov in "Crime and Punishment"**: Initially aloof due to a nihilistic worldview, he is slowly consumed by guilt from his actions, leading him to confess and seek redemption.
    - **Frank Friedmaier in "Dirty Snow"**: A criminal during WWII in occupied Belgium, Frank commits numerous heinous acts but deep down desires purification. Despite his external disdain for affection and morality, his interactions with characters like Sissy reveal an underlying struggle with self-worth and redemption.

4. **Nature of Such Characters**:
    - These villains often perceive their actions as a justified response to the perceived falseness, hypocrisy, or corruption in their environment. Their destructive path is both an act of rebellion and a cry for purification.
    - Their actions, rooted in intense cynicism, may be viewed as rebellion against insincerity or as a response to life's perceived meaninglessness. An undercurrent of self-hatred and defiance propels their actions.
    - At their core, these villains believe that a complete breakdown, including their own downfall, is needed for a new beginning.

**Essence**: 
Certain villains, amidst their wrongdoings, are driven by a complex interplay of conscious malevolence and subconscious desire for punishment or redemption. Through a series of harmful acts, they yearn, perhaps unknowingly, for a cathartic release and a path toward authenticity.
### SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN CHAPTER
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Title**: **Understanding Villains: Nature, Nurture, and Morality**

**1. The Nature vs. Nurture Debate**:
- Not all individuals crave goodness; some truly yearn for harm and destruction.
- While some might be labeled as born with a "malignant heart", it's essential not to simply judge them based on a clinical diagnosis.
- The environment, especially a traumatic past (e.g., child abuse, torture), can shape a villain's disposition. Such traumatic experiences can obliterate their capacity to love or trust.

**2. The Moral Argument**:
- Every character has an inherent moral code that reflects their balance between personal desires and societal norms.
- Villains often provide moral justifications for their actions, sometimes presenting them as part of a grander benevolent purpose. This makes the character more credible and intimidating.

**3. Characterization Techniques**:
   - **Opaque vs. Transparent**: Opaque characters like Shakespeare’s Iago don't reveal clear motivations, allowing audiences to form their own interpretations. Transparent characters, on the other hand, have explicit backstories that provide context for their actions.
   - **Evil Incarnate vs. Fatally Human**: While an evil incarnate villain embodies pure malice, a humanized villain blurs the moral lines and can be more complex.
   - **Devil vs. Monster**: The devil-like villain is cunning, cruel, and self-aware, seeking dominance. In contrast, the monster-like villain acts on impulse and lacks self-awareness.
   - **Psychopath vs. Sociopath**: Psychopaths are entirely self-focused, while sociopaths possess a group loyalty, targeting those outside their group.

**4. The Villain's Inner Struggle**:
- Some villains may secretly wish for punishment or redemption.
- This internal conflict between wanting to continue their wrongdoing and seeking punishment can stem from deep-rooted self-loathing or a distorted path to self-redemption.

**Essence**:
Villains in literature are multi-dimensional characters, shaped by both inherent traits and environmental factors. Understanding their internal moral compass, the justifications they provide for their actions, and their deep-seated yearnings can offer a richer insight into their complexities. This comprehensive understanding can be achieved by avoiding simplistic judgments and exploring the intricate interplay of nature, nurture, and morality.

## 10 Divided Desire 
**Summary:**

In the excerpt from "Under Western Eyes" by Joseph Conrad, the complexity of human morality is emphasized, suggesting that humans, with their myriad motivations and errors, shouldn't be strictly labeled as purely good or evil. Conrad hints at a more nuanced understanding of morality, especially when compared to the traditionally one-dimensional view of "the Evil One."

Drawing a parallel, the passage brings up the final episode of "Breaking Bad," where Walter White's desperate plea for escape is likened to the ancient Greek hero Odysseus's yearning to return home. Both figures, despite their vastly different backgrounds and timelines, embody psychological intricacies and moral dilemmas, representing a broader class of characters known as "anti-heroes."

The term "anti-hero" denotes characters who don't fit the typical mold of heroism, characterized by qualities like altruism, honesty, and idealism. Instead, these figures possess traits that often clash with societal norms or ideals. Their allure to audiences is vast and timeless, with a range of popular characters from modern TV shows like Tony Soprano, Dexter Morgan, and Walter White, exemplifying this archetype.

This popularity of the anti-hero archetype tends to surge during periods when society begins to question or rebel against established ideals that may appear outdated or misguided. The core of the anti-hero's existence is underlined by their resistance to conformity and an innate defiance against the status quo.

**Summary:**

Thersites from the Iliad is sometimes considered the first anti-hero due to his audacity to criticize Agamemnon openly, a viewpoint shared silently by many warriors. However, his minor presence in the narrative makes him less of a prototype for the anti-hero archetype. In contrast, Odysseus stands out, especially when juxtaposed with other warriors like Achilles and Ajax. The Iliad portrays the shift from a period valuing purely heroic attributes to one that values the skills of rhetoric and cunning. Both Achilles and Ajax symbolize the traditional heroic ideal, but their deaths mark the decline of this age.

From this point, Odysseus becomes central, embodying both the characteristics of a great warrior and a master manipulator. His lineage traces back to the crafty Hermes and the thief Autolycus. Notably, Odysseus is renowned for his intelligence and strategic deceptions as much as for his valor. He engages in various acts that reveal his multifaceted personality—both as an unparalleled warrior and as an individual willing to exploit any situation for his benefit. This unpredictable nature of Odysseus adds an element of suspense and intrigue, making him a unique figure in ancient Western literature. His internal conflicts and dualities are more profound than other characters like Moses, Oedipus, and David, highlighting the difference between a mere heroic flaw and a deeply conflicted psyche.

**Summary:**

For many centuries after the era of Odysseus, characters resembling him were absent in Western literature. This gap was largely because the Romans looked down on Odysseus, believing he contradicted their values of duty and honor. The Romans admired the hero Aeneas and the defeated Trojans over the Greeks, viewing the latter as immoral. Virgil, a Roman poet, often described Ulysses (the Roman counterpart to Odysseus) with negative terms. While traces of Odysseus-like characters could be found in works by Menander, Plautus, Terence, Apuleius, and Petronius, these depictions were more satirical and lacked the grandeur and depth of the original warrior, Odysseus.

**Summary:**

As the Middle Ages transitioned into the Renaissance, the tales of noble knights began to lose their allure, giving way to a novel genre influenced by Arabic maqamat and Slavic folktales. One of the earliest and most influential works in this genre was "The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes," released in 1554. Instead of showcasing noble heroes, these novels revolved around charming rogues, known as picaros, navigating through corrupt societies with both virtue and vice in their characters. This duality echoed the characteristics of Odysseus. These tales, while critiquing the clergy and societal norms, often hinted at redemption. This new genre, the picaresque novel, gained popularity across Europe, especially in England. Famous characters like Tom Jones, Moll Flanders, and Barry Lyndon all embody this mix of good and bad qualities, shaped by the challenges they face in unjust societies.

CLARIFY AND SUMMARIZE 
As the popularity of the English picaresque novel was cresting in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, another type of hero was taking shape. Like the picaro and the wanderer, he was a social outsider, but it was temperament rather than class that defined his iconoclasm. A kind of orphan child of Romanticism, he possessed a brooding intelligence that defied the coal-stoked ambition and pompous vulgarity of the Industrial Revolution. With Hamlet as forebear and Lord Byron as mastermind, this hero gave us the Gothic novel and found himself incarnated in characters as diverse as the Brontë sisters’ Heathcliff and Rochester, Victor Hugo’s Quasimodo, Alexandre Dumas’s Count of Monte Cristo, and the original vampire, Lord Ruthven. Byron, describing the pirate hero of his verse tale The Corsair, provided a kind of template: He knew himself a villain—but he deem’d The rest no better than the thing he seem’d; And scorn’d the best as hypocrites Or, as Lady Caroline Lamb said of Byron himself, this new breed of icon was “mad, bad, and dangerous to know.” Again, the theme of defining a new, more authentic morality in a society rotten with falsity found voice in a hero neither evil nor virtuous, but revealing instead an uneasy marriage of both.

**Summary:**

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, while the English picaresque novel was at its peak, a different kind of hero emerged. This hero, deeply rooted in Romanticism, was characterized more by his brooding temperament than his societal class. Influenced by figures like Hamlet and greatly popularized by Lord Byron, this new hero led to the Gothic novel. Characters such as Heathcliff, Rochester, Quasimodo, Count of Monte Cristo, and the original vampire, Lord Ruthven, embody this archetype. Byron's own description of the pirate hero from "The Corsair" and Lady Caroline Lamb's statement about Byron depict this new kind of character as complex and unpredictable – a blend of virtue and vice, challenging the societal norms of their time.

**Summary:**

During the era of the American West, Europe was also re-evaluating its definition of heroism. Amid sensationalized stories from newspapers and novels, a distinct American archetype emerged known as the "Good Bad Man." This character, shaped by the brutality of the Civil War, confrontations with Native Americans, and the vast, wild frontier, had to possess not just valor but also cunning and a capacity for violence. Among these figures, John Henry "Doc" Holliday stands out. Despite being described as loyal and brave by Wyatt Earp, many others saw him as temperamental and dangerous, especially when under the influence of alcohol. However, his complexity – a well-educated dentist turned gambler and feared gunman – made him a captivating figure in the lore of the American West.

**Summary:**

The evolution of the anti-hero in literature mirrors the transformation of the traditional hero. Initially, heroes were depicted as flawless champions of virtue, but over time, they were portrayed as more complex, possessing inherent flaws. This idea of the flawed hero traces back to Greek tragedies, where Aristotle suggested that heroes make errors due to lapses in judgment rather than intrinsic character flaws. However, this error eventually came to be understood as the hero's "tragic flaw." By the 19th century, as novels focused on self-improvement became popular, heroes were portrayed as characters capable of recognizing and overcoming their flaws through introspection and self-transformation. Still, some narratives remained skeptical of the possibility or even the desirability of such transformative change. Despite Freud's exploration of the human psyche suggesting the potential for healing through insight, his depiction of the Unconscious often seemed so dark that it felt like the best one could hope for was a delicate balance with inner conflicts, especially when it came to creativity.

**Summary:**

The image of a conflicted hero, torn between nobility and infamy, became increasingly dominant in Western narratives, especially during the tumultuous events of the 20th century. The grim realities of World Wars I and II, as well as events like the Holocaust and Hiroshima, shook traditional notions of heroism and nobility. Post these traumatic events, the concept of moral uncertainty was deeply embedded in the Western psyche. Noir, a genre characterized by its morally ambiguous protagonists, became popular post-WWII. However, there were periodic cultural attempts to restore optimism and idealism, as seen in the rise of Technicolor movies and Ronald Reagan's era. Yet, as the 1990s approached, with its economic disparities and apparent prosperity, noir experienced a resurgence. Writers during this period portrayed characters that challenged societal hypocrisy and resisted conformity.

**Summary:**

The proliferation of anti-heroes in television since "The Sopranos" in 1999 can be seen as a reflection of societal anxieties and distrust in traditional institutions. The economic turmoil and political dysfunction of the time created a ripe environment for such characters, who embody the complex nature of human morality. These anti-heroes, like Tony Soprano and Walter White, navigate through layers of personal and societal conflict, providing a rich dramatic canvas for storytelling. Their unpredictable nature, a result of their inner moral conflicts, adds suspense and depth to long-format narratives, making them attractive characters in the era of binge-watching.

However, there's a growing sentiment that amidst the dominant portrayal of anti-heroes, there's a need to bring back virtuous characters. As expressed by actor Brendan Gleeson, portraying genuinely good characters without them seeming sentimental or unrealistic is essential. The constant portrayal of the anti-hero might have numbed our perception of genuine goodness. There's a call for characters who, despite their flaws, strive for righteousness and provide inspiration in times of disillusionment.

   - Readers are urged to recall vivid memories or "scenes" from their past, enhancing emotional understanding.

3. **Personalization in Acting and Storytelling**:
   - Drawing from personal experiences provides a foundation for understanding characters. This method, known as “personalization” in acting, uses real-life experiences as a stepping stone to imagine characters' lives.

4. **Self-awareness and Storytelling**:
   - Recognizing one's emotions, strengths, and weaknesses aids in understanding characters. But it's just a start. A storyteller must then imagine “What if” scenarios for their characters.
