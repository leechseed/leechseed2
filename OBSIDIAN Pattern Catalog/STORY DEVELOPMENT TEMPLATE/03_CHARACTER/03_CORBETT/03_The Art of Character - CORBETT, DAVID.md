## INTRODUCTION
**Summary:**

The art of storytelling is a profound exploration of questions about our existence, like who we are, where we come from, and where we're going. The essence of a story lies in its characters rather than its ideas. These characters mirror our own experiences, reflecting our desires, vulnerabilities, and contradictions. While ideas provide a framework for our narrative, characters ground these ideas in the real, messy details of daily life. They help us grapple with the ultimate uncertainties of life and death.

The author has written a book that delves into characterization, presenting a method rooted in years of writing stories and novels. Central to this method is the belief that character is shaped through interactions with others and the world. To truly understand and depict characters, a writer must first know themselves deeply. This understanding aids in creating scenes where characters face conflicts, revealing their desires, vulnerabilities, and reactions. Relying on intuition is crucial, as it allows for a genuine portrayal of characters and helps avoid reducing them to mere plot devices.

Character development is multifaceted, involving their desires, how they handle frustration, and their inner growth or transformation. Characters should resonate with readers, presenting questions about their identity and desires. Despite the vast content in this book, writers should see it as a toolkit, using only what is necessary for their story, and avoiding overburdening the narrative with excessive details. Finally, the goal of every writer should be to create characters that feel alive and real, acting as companions in their storytelling journey.

## Part I - Conceiving the Character 
### Chapter One - Fingering Smoke: Are Characters Created or Discovered?
**Summary:**

The text delves into the complexities of artistic creation, particularly in the domain of character creation in literature. Several great artists' methods are examined:

1. **Michelangelo** saw himself as freeing sculptures from their marble confines, believing the true creator was God.
2. **Martin McDonagh** felt his characters as real, demanding presences, speaking to him, waiting to be transcribed.
3. **Jackson Pollock** intuitively painted until he felt an internal signal to stop, reminiscent of a fiction writer refining an idea.

The discourse emphasizes two approaches to character development: **discovery**, as if the characters exist and must be found, and **creation**, where characters are meticulously crafted. Both methods have their challenges, and the question becomes knowing when a character or piece feels complete, akin to how John Coltrane struggled with ending his solos.

The writer's relationship with characters is complex. Some may come easily and vividly, while others require meticulous development. Characters might be imagined as entirely new or inspired by real people. Regardless of the method, the process demands a balance between conscious intentionality and organic development.

In the writer's personal experience, character creation is an iterative process, switching between acts of discovery and creation. He leans on William James' idea that conscious effort combined with stepping away allows for the unconscious to shape and refine our work. He likens characterization to the tale of Geppetto and Pinocchio: writers start with raw material, and through passion and effort, give it life.

Lastly, while archetypes can be helpful, merely naming a character after a familiar archetype doesn't guarantee depth or resonance. Genuine characterization requires delving deep into one's imagination and emotions. The real essence of a character is determined not by labels but by their desires, actions, and the writer's intimate engagement with them.

### Chapter Two - Summoning Ghosts: Source Materials for Characters
**Summary:**

Characters in writing typically emerge from five primary sources: 
1. The story itself 
2. The writer's unconscious 
3. Inspiration from various art forms and nature 
4. Actual people 
5. Composite (mixture) of various sources. 

Each of these origins offers its strengths and weaknesses, but they can be combined to complement each other. However, using a source merely as an initial spark is crucial. Relying too heavily on the initial emotional or psychological impact of a character's inspiration can stifle its evolution. Effective characterization demands growth and change, allowing characters to evolve in unexpected yet believable ways.

While these techniques can provide valuable insights for writers, they should be seen as tools rather than strict guidelines. Writers should be adaptable, venturing beyond their comfort zones, as true creativity often flourishes in the face of the unknown.
#### The Story as the Source for One's Characters
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters often emerge from the story's premise. However, relying solely on the story can lead to characters that feel two-dimensional or like mere "plot puppets." Instead of just functioning as tools to advance the plot, characters should be imagined as real people impacted by the events of the story.

Three examples are given to elucidate this:

1. **Bel Canto by Ann Patchett:** This novel is based on a real-life hostage standoff at the Japanese embassy in Lima, Peru. Instead of sticking only to the plot's requirements, Patchett develops characters deeply, like the opera-loving businessman, the soprano, and others. Each character is painted with specificity, making them feel real and not confined to the original event.
 
2. **City of Thieves by David Benioff:** This novel, set during the German siege of Leningrad, describes the adventures of two young men. While the backdrop is historical, the depth and complexity of characters like Lev and Kolya come from Benioff's exploration of human nature, not just the wartime setting.

3. **Chinatown (Film):** The film's plot was inspired by real events in Los Angeles. However, the creation of the detective Jake Gittes requires imagination beyond just the plot's constraints. The world-building around Jake - his associates, past, and connections - serves to develop a multifaceted character rather than a mere plot device.

The crux of the discussion revolves around genre and formula. Every story fits into a genre, which has its conventions. The challenge for writers is to respect these conventions while innovating. The problem arises when writers adhere too rigidly to formulas, which can restrict character development. Characters should have the freedom to surprise and develop outside of the story's confines. The goal is to ensure characters embody the story's themes and navigate the plot authentically, but not be limited by them.
#### Characters Derived from the Unconscious
**Summary:**

Alexandra Sokoloff encourages writers to maintain a dream journal as it can provide inspiration and material for their work. The writer recalls an anecdote by Maurice Sendak, where, during his illness as a child, he imagined seeing an angel after his father's encouragement. The writer typically relies on their unconscious mind to refine and develop characters, rather than relying on dreams. However, if dreams offer valuable content, they shouldn't be disregarded. Dreams can provide rich character details, while story ideas often demand expansion beyond just the characters. The challenge is integrating dream-inspired characters into a cohesive narrative. French novelist Nathalie Sarraute wrote "Tropisms" based on "movements" or subconscious interactions she observed, which had dream-like qualities. These insights acted as raw material for her future works.
#### Characters Derived from Art or Nature
**Summary:**

Writers often find inspiration for characters from elements in art and nature, such as the enduring nature of a tree or the elegance of a hawk. While these initial inspirations might be static and unchanging, for richer characterization, they should be considered starting points and evolved from there. Art forms like paintings, sculptures, and photographs can spark character ideas. Engaging with these artworks by imagining their stories or interactions can add depth to characters. For example, photographs can provide powerful immediacy, and the author mentions specific photographers like Robert Frank and Susan Meiselas who inspire them. Music is also a potent tool for character inspiration, as it encompasses various moods and has the dynamism akin to a person's ability to change. The author cites an example from their own novel where music captured the gentler side of a character. Ultimately, while various non-human sources, such as art, nature, or even tarot cards and astrology, can inspire character creation, it's crucial to keep their potential open-ended, ensuring their actions remain unpredictable and engaging.
#### Characters Based on Real People
**Summary and Clarification**:

Characters inspired by real people provide a rich source of material for writers, given that our lives are filled with multifaceted individuals. However, even though these real-life inspirations may seem thoroughly familiar to us, it's essential to remember that we only perceive an external facet of their existence. We don't have complete access to their inner thoughts, emotions, and motivations. Our best reference point for understanding the internal world is ourselves, but even that is fraught with challenges. Often, our self-perceptions are influenced by biases, and a significant portion of our behaviors stem from unconscious processes.

This idea is encapsulated by the metaphor of a child on an elephant or a stowaway on a ship, suggesting that we have limited control and understanding of the vast forces that drive us. In contrast, when crafting fictional characters, writers may feel they understand these creations better than real people because they dedicate focused time and energy to developing and exploring their depths. However, this doesn't mean characters are more comprehensible than real individuals; it's just that writers are more invested in their fictional creations.

A significant point to remember is that absolute knowledge of a character can be limiting. Just as real people can surprise us with unexpected behaviors, so should fictional characters remain somewhat unpredictable. This unpredictability keeps characters dynamic and prevents them from being overly defined or "trapped."

**Summary and Clarification**:

This passage provides an in-depth exercise for aspiring writers or individuals looking to deepen their self-awareness by reflecting on significant people from their past and present. By listing various individuals based on distinct relationships or emotional connections (e.g., a close family member, a childhood nemesis, a person you admire, etc.), one is encouraged to remember their physical appearance, emotional impact, and significant shared experiences.

- **a.** A family member to whom you feel particularly close
- **b.** A family member from whom you’re estranged or whom you particularly dislike
- **c.** A stranger whose path crossed yours this past week
- **d.** A person you know personally and admire
- **e.** A person you know personally and fear
- **f.** The love who got away
- **g.** The love you wish had gotten away
- **h.** First love
- **i.** Greatest love
- **j.** Greatest childhood nemesis
- **k.** Greatest adulthood nemesis
- **l.** Person from childhood who annoyed you the most
- **m.** Person in your present-day life who annoys you the most
- **n.** Favorite neighbor
- **o.** Least favorite neighbor
- **p.** Favorite coworker
- **q.** Least favorite coworker
- **r.** Your mail carrier or someone else you deal with on a “business” level daily
- **s.** An older person who has inspired you
- **t.** A child who fascinates you
- **u.** Someone on whom you have a secret crush
- **v.** Someone you believe has a crush on you
- **w.** A person who believed in you
- **x.** A person who thought you’d never amount to anything
- **y.** A person you envy
- **z.** A person whose life you would never trade for your own

The main objective of this exercise is to foster a profound emotional connection to one's memories and the people within them. Over time, daily life can cloud or overshadow these emotional ties, but such exercises can bring them back to the forefront. Reflecting on different life periods can also offer a more extensive array of characters and emotional experiences. Recognizing patterns or connections between different individuals in one's life can provide insight into personal biases, emotional tendencies, and areas of growth. 

Moreover, while this exercise focuses on familiar figures, inspiration can also stem from strangers. Observing and eavesdropping can fuel imagination, as seen with the actress Sarah Jones, who draws inspiration from her observations in New York. Everyone has unique characters in their life, regardless of how "ordinary" their experiences might seem. The passage ends with a reminder of the value of everyday individuals, using George Eliot's words as a testament to the importance and impact of those who lead quiet, uncelebrated lives. Everyone, regardless of their outward significance, has a story to tell and can offer insights and inspirations for character creation.

#### Composite Characters
**Summary:**

Creating characters for fiction often involves merging elements from various sources, like real people, photographs, music, or imagination. This composite approach can result in unique characters that are richer than their individual parts, especially when the author wishes to avoid directly portraying real individuals. However, pitfalls arise when combining traits that don't naturally fit together. For instance, action movies might inaccurately depict women in traditionally male roles without understanding the nuances of women's experiences in those professions. Similarly, blending character traits without acknowledging their formative experiences, such as a priest and a war veteran, can lead to inauthentic portrayals. Successfully crafting composite characters requires an understanding of their history and formative experiences, ensuring they remain lifelike and believable.



### Chapter Three - The Examined Life: Using Personal Experience as an Intuitive Link to the Character
**Summary:**

Writers should not merely "write what they know," but delve deeper into unfamiliar terrains by bridging the gap between the known and unknown using research, empathy, and imagination. This chapter highlights the importance of understanding oneself to better engage with fictional characters. Mere factual knowledge doesn’t offer the depth and nuance required; writers need to connect emotionally, leveraging their own personal experiences and memories to infuse authenticity into characters, even if their backgrounds differ significantly.

Personal emotional experiences and memories, even if challenging or painful, serve as valuable tools for writers. The chapter provides a comprehensive list of moments and emotions that writers can introspect on — from moments of pride, shame, joy, sadness, love to confrontations, regrets, and more. Exploring these moments deeply can help writers connect with their characters, especially in terms of emotional experiences, reactions, and growth. It emphasizes that these personal experiences, when understood in depth, can lead to more authentic storytelling, helping writers relate to characters and narratives that might be far removed from their own lived experiences.

## PART II - Developing the Character

### Chapter Four - Five Cornerstones of Dramatic Characterization 

### Chapter Five - Desire as Purpose: A Driving Need, Want, Ambition, or Goal
**Summary:**

The author provides a detailed scenario involving a woman in a grocery store, dressed incongruously in evening wear, struggling to get a can of peaches. This scene evokes a vivid mental image of the woman, even without describing her physical appearance. The author suggests that there are five essential elements that make this depiction compelling:

1. **Desire:** The character has a clear want or need.
2. **Obstacle & Plan:** The character faces difficulty and devises a strategy to overcome it.
3. **Contradiction:** The character's behavior or appearance contrasts with the setting or situation.
4. **Unexpected Events & Vulnerability:** Unforeseen events make the character vulnerable, enhancing empathy from the reader.
5. **Secrets:** The character's actions hint at underlying secrets, inviting curiosity.

These elements are crucial for crafting a compelling character, but they aren't a magic formula. The development of characters requires deep understanding, insight, and continuous refinement. While it's essential to think about these elements when creating or refining characters, the author stresses the importance of patience, solitude, and deep thinking. The subsequent chapters of the book will delve deeper into these elements, emphasizing the nuances of character-building and how to make characters and their worlds feel genuine. The ultimate message is that great artists take time to deeply contemplate even the simplest elements, leading to richer and more engaging characters and stories.
#### The Centrality of Desire
**Summary:**

Constantin Stanislavski highlighted the pivotal role of desire in shaping characters and narratives. He believed that the essence of characterization revolves around characters having desires, with deeper desires leading to more captivating drama. This is because desire inherently brings about conflict; if a character has no wants, then there's no adversity, making the story uneventful. Intense desires can make characters act in ways they wouldn't typically, pushing them to confront challenges and evolve. In Stanislavski's view, where Aristotle believed man's primary objective was to fulfill a basic purpose, Stanislavski saw man's main drive as fulfilling deep-seated ambitions and needs. Peter Brooks echoed this sentiment, stating that without desires, stories lack life and movement. A fundamental query for any character should be determining what they desire at various levels of the narrative and, on a broader scale, in their life. Evaluating whether they've achieved these desires and the implications of such achievements is crucial for deep characterization.
#### The Complexity of Desire-and thus the Need for Clarity
**Summary:**

Desire, in storytelling, is a complex aspect that often embodies layered, sometimes contradictory, emotions and aspirations. While we might not always comprehend our own desires or may even suppress them, these feelings are dramatically intriguing. However, the intricacy of desire can lead to confusion, making clarity essential in storytelling.

In narratives, it's beneficial to provide characters with an explicit, tangible goal or desire, even if this goal is just a symbol for deeper, more profound yearnings. For example, in Junot Díaz’s "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao", the character Belicia wishes to escape, a clear ambition that encompasses her numerous, more intricate desires. Similarly, characters like Ahab in "Moby-Dick" and Gatsby in "The Great Gatsby" possess clear goals (the whale and Daisy, respectively), yet these goals are mere representations of profound, possibly unidentifiable desires. Beginning writers often mistake vagueness for subtlety, but clear, obsessive desires in characters enhance the narrative's depth and engagement.

This is demonstrated in the HBO series "Luck", where Chester “Ace” Bernstein, after exiting prison, has a clear goal to reclaim his stature in the gambling world. Yet, as he engages with characters like Gus, Claire, and the horse, Pint of Plain, his deeper desires for trust, companionship, and a search for his own soul become evident. These internal longings are illuminated by the external goal of purchasing the racetrack. In essence, the concrete desires or goals in storytelling are crucial as they pave the way for deeper character exploration and complexities.
#### Variety in the Depiction of Desire
**Summary:**

The pursuit of desires, ambitions, or needs in literature can be portrayed in a multitude of ways, ensuring a rich narrative that delves deep into the complexity of human nature. Examples include:

1. **When Conflict Clarifies or Transforms Desire:** Like in "The Godfather", where Michael Corleone's initial aversion to his family's crime empire evolves into an intimate relationship with it after personal loss and revenge. Similarly, "Thelma and Louise" chronicles the shift of two women's yearning for a fun-filled weekend to a desperate escape from their imprisoning lives.

2. **Character Suffers Two Irreconcilable Desires:** Classic tragedies like those of Orestes, Antigone, and Coriolanus showcase characters grappling with two impossible choices, leading to intense drama. The issue, however, is when a character like Zoe Kruller in "Little Bird of Heaven" is presented with a dilemma but lacks a strong desire or direction, making the narrative stagnant.

3. **The Power of Desire and Failure:** Despite facing repeated failures, characters like Edward Casaubon in "Middlemarch" prove that it's the striving that matters, even if it leads to failure. This idea gets extended when characters have a conscious desire conflicting with an unconscious one, as seen in "Midnight Cowboy" with Joe Buck's journey from seeking superficial connections to a deeper intimacy.

4. **Discovering the True Value of Desire:** Some narratives show characters realizing that their primary desire is not what they genuinely need or want. Examples include "Frozen River", where the protagonist's pursuit of a material object (a trailer) makes her realize the deeper value of family. Another variant is seen in "About a Boy" and "Roger Dodger", where the protagonists seek relationships but end up gaining a deeper understanding of themselves through unexpected bonds.

In essence, literature effectively uses the multifaceted nature of desires and ambitions to delve into the depths of human character, revealing that the journey to fulfilling these desires can often be more significant than the end goal.

---
**Summary:**

The passage discusses the intricacy of character desires in creative writing. While characters might have explicit wants like love, fame, or power, they often harbor deeper, unspoken desires. To truly understand a character's motivation, writers must delve deep into these underlying wants, which drive the character's actions, sometimes even contradicting their overt goals. A character's "core desire" is central to their identity and can reveal what they truly seek in life. For impactful storytelling, it's vital to recognize and explore these desires. Notably, this isn't limited to fictional characters. Writers must introspect and understand their own desires to better grasp those of their characters. The text provides various examples of classic characters from literature and TV, like Macbeth, Willy Loman, and Walter White, to illustrate the influence of these core desires on a storyline.
### Chapter Six - Desire Denied: Adaptations, Defense Mechanisms, and Pathological Maneuvers

#### The Normality at the Heart of the Pathological Maneuver
**Summary:**

The passage discusses the significance of reactions to conflict in determining an individual's success and well-being. Research from Harvard, which studied 268 men over 72 years, found that the most pivotal factor in leading a fulfilled life was one's reaction to stress, failure, and setbacks. Drawing from Anna Freud's work on "adaptations" or "defense mechanisms", the research highlights how people unconsciously react to adversities. These mechanisms evolve over time, but some individuals might hold onto less mature adaptations, affecting their interactions and ability to handle life's challenges. 

George Vaillant, who analyzed this study, established a four-tier hierarchy of these adaptations, from least adaptive to most:
1. Psychotic adaptations like paranoia and hallucination.
2. Immature adaptations such as passive aggression and fantasy.
3. Neurotic adaptations like intellectualization and repression.
4. Mature adaptations, which include humor, anticipation, and sublimation.

While this analytical framework provides insights for character development in writing, the author cautions against relying solely on it as it might lead to overintellectualization. Instead, writers should envision dramatic scenes to effectively capture a character's response to conflicts.
#### Dramatizing Growth from One Level of Adaptation to Another - The Ghost and the Revenant
**Summary and Clarification**:

Stories often revolve around a central character's journey from unhealthy coping mechanisms or behaviors to healthier ones. This transformation often doesn't follow a straightforward path but is marked by growth, setbacks, and personal revelations.

* In **"Crazy Heart,"** Bad Blake, an alcoholic country singer, tries to change his ways after falling for Jean Craddock and experiencing the repercussions of his drinking habits. The story highlights the difficulties of change and how past actions, like neglecting his son, can haunt a person's present.

* **"Breaking Bad"** presents Jesse Pinkman, a drug addict who grapples with his negative self-perception and the consequences of his choices, like the overdose death of his girlfriend Jane. His struggle with addiction is depicted as a turbulent journey influenced by his past actions and present triggers.

* The movie **"Secretary"** focuses on Lee Holloway, a young woman who copes with her tumultuous family life by self-harming. Through a unique relationship with her employer, Mr. Grey, she finds a way to externalize and understand her pain, transforming from a secret self-harmer to openly sharing her emotions.

* In **"Michael Clayton,"** the titular character is a "fixer" who's good at solving others' problems but struggles with his own gambling addiction. Faced with a moral dilemma, he's forced to confront his past decisions, personified by his relationships with his son and a bipolar attorney, Arthur.

These narratives demonstrate a recurring theme: Characters confront their maladaptive behaviors and seek growth, often influenced by two pivotal characters. One represents their past failures (the "ghost"), while the other presents an opportunity for change in the present (the "revenant"). Through interactions with these characters, protagonists face their inner conflicts and, in many cases, move towards a healthier state of mind or behavior.
#### Core Versus Secondary Desire and Adaptations
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters in stories often have two types of desires: core desires and secondary desires. 

**Core Desires**: These are deep-seated desires that define the very essence of the character's life. How a character responds to the frustration of this core desire provides insight into their deeper emotional makeup and psychological state. For instance, a man whose core desire is romantic love might react in various ways when love remains elusive. He could become bitter, resigned, or seek solace in alcohol, familial bonds, or platonic relationships. The truest way to understand a character's response to thwarted core desires is to put them in situations (like heartbreak) that challenge those desires. By watching their reactions, writers can unveil the character's internal processes.

**Secondary Desires**: These are more situational or minor desires. How a character reacts to these frustrations might differ from their core ones. For instance, a man heartbroken in love might still exhibit proficiency in fixing things around the house. He could maturely handle these minor frustrations, contrasting with his neurotic reactions to romantic setbacks.

Adding layers of reactions, both mature and neurotic, across different situations can provide depth to a character, making them more complex and relatable. This concept, called contradiction, will be explored further in subsequent chapters.

The text also provides examples from literature and pop culture:

1. **Lady Macbeth and Macbeth**: Lady Macbeth suffers from paranoid hallucinations, while Macbeth, due to guilt, misinterprets prophecies leading him to false confidence and indecision.
  
2. **Willy Loman (Death of a Salesman)**: He responds to failures by clinging more tightly to the American Dream (denial) while secretly contemplating suicide.
  
3. **Kathy Nicolo (House of Sand and Fog)**: Kathy blames others for her mistakes, spirals into depression, manipulates using sexuality, and abuses substances when faced with stress.
  
4. **Blanche DuBois**: Blanche uses alcohol, blames others, manipulates her sister, and escapes into fantasies to deny her role in her own downfall.
  
5. **Beth (Citizen Vince)**: When confronted with disappointment, she opts for delusion and escapism.
  
6. **Walter White (Breaking Bad)**: Whenever faced with threats, Walter leverages his intelligence to think his way out of problems.

In essence, characters' reactions to both core and secondary frustrations can provide significant insights into their depth and intricacies.
### Chapter Seven - The Power of Wounds: Vulnerability 
**Summary and Clarification:**

In fiction, vulnerability in characters elicits a powerful human reaction, drawing readers closer to the character. This pull is not necessarily driven by the character being "likable" but by them being involved in a consequential struggle. Vulnerability can be portrayed in various forms:

1. **Existential Vulnerability:** Physical wounds, severe illness, or immediate danger. These elevate the stakes in a story, but they must feel genuine and not contrived for mere effect.
  
2. **Situational Vulnerability:** Examples include being jobless, stranded, or navigating unfamiliar situations.
  
3. **Moral Vulnerability:** Actions of the character place her in a position to be judged, reflecting a threat to the character's values or reputation.

The essence of vulnerability lies in the concept of threat — be it physical, emotional, spiritual, or psychological. Showcasing vulnerability amplifies the drama and stakes in a story.

A special mention is made of shame, an emotion related to vulnerability. Shame emerges from the fear of disconnection when one believes that their actions or revelations will lead to rejection or disgust from others. Overcoming this shame, especially in the face of vulnerability, often forms a key aspect of a character's arc.

A series of questions and considerations are provided to help writers understand their characters' vulnerabilities better. These include understanding the sources of their vulnerabilities, any secrets they hold, their past experiences with vulnerability, and their fundamental beliefs about their self-worth and love.

Returning to literature examples: Characters like Macbeth, Willy Loman, Kathy from "House of Sand and Fog," Blanche DuBois, Beth from "Citizen Vince," and Walt from "Breaking Bad" all showcase varied forms of vulnerabilities that engage the readers and contribute to the depth and drama of their respective stories.

### Chapter Eight - The Gravity of the Hidden: Secrets 
**Summary:**

Subtext, as described by Leslie Schwerin, is the underlying meaning or theme in a work of art, often driven by what's hidden or concealed—the "thing beneath the thing." Secrets, whether they are big or small, create a tension between what is revealed and what is withheld. The allure of a secret is so powerful that it draws the attention of audiences, much like the curiosity of legendary figures such as Pandora or Psyche. This powerful pull towards the unknown is termed by Christopher Vogler as the "Law of the Secret Door". 

Secrets shape how people perceive us and, at times, dictate our actions based on the fear of exposure. Such revelations can change our standing in our communities and amongst our loved ones. The ego, which often masks our vulnerabilities, operates on the basis of concealing these secrets to avoid potential ostracization. Modern drama frequently revolves around the theme of uncovering secrets, revealing our hidden selves, and confronting the consequences.

While secrets are intentionally hidden, there are also repressed traits or behaviors which, from a storytelling perspective, are just secrets buried deeper due to prolonged deceit. The exposure of both secrets and repressed traits can result in significant dramatic tension as they challenge our public identities.

The story of Tom Ripley, as illustrated in Patricia Highsmith's "The Talented Mr. Ripley," exemplifies the enigmatic allure of a character whose every action conceals a secret, with layers of deceit even in his own self-conception. Similarly, Freddie Clegg in John Fowles’s "The Collector" represents another facet of this theme. 

Even secondary characters in stories, like Dan in the film "Tumbleweeds", can have profound secrets that when revealed, reshape the audience's understanding of them. For writers, the timing of revealing a secret is crucial, often best saved until a key dramatic moment in the narrative.

Various famous stories, such as Macbeth, House of Sand and Fog, A Streetcar Named Desire, Citizen Vince, and Breaking Bad, leverage secrets to amplify the narrative's tension and depth. Secrets aren't essential in every story, but they provide a potent tool to showcase a character’s vulnerability and the repercussions of their past actions.
### Chapter Nine - The Paradox of This but That: Contradictions
**Summary:**

Jean Cocteau suggests that the essence of creation lies in contradictions. Contradictions in characters are intriguing because they defy our expectations. Such contradictions can be physical, dispositional, behavioral, or related to nicknames. They provide depth and make characters seem more complex, leading us to believe that there's more to a person than what meets the eye. Dramatically, contradictions serve to surprise the audience, add layers of complexity, hint at hidden thoughts or emotions (subtext), reflect social nuances, show a clash between conscious and unconscious actions, and create suspense. They can even be used to hint at future events (foreshadowing).

Using Raymond Chandler's "The Long Goodbye" as an example, the character Terry Lennox is full of contradictions that captivate the reader's curiosity. However, there are limits. If a contradiction feels too out of place, it might seem unbelievable. In comedic settings, extreme contradictions can be funny, but in drama, they might feel forced. For a contradiction to be believable, the writer must ground it in the character's backstory. If a contradiction feels more like an idea than a genuine trait, it might distance readers from the character.

Lastly, while some might see contradictions as inappropriate, writers shouldn't be constrained by rigid norms. Instead, they should focus on creating characters with depth, even if this means exploring contradictions. However, merging two opposing traits requires careful crafting. The article suggests that contradictions can be ranked from superficial to substantial, indicating that deeper exploration of these aspects is necessary.

---
**Summary:**

The text discusses various forms of contradictions that manifest in characters and situations, making them more intriguing and relatable. These contradictions reflect the multi-faceted nature of human beings and situations.

1. **Contradictions from Physical, Ironic, or Comic Juxtaposition**: These are evident when an individual's appearance or nickname contradicts their personality or actions. For instance, a large person named "Tiny" or an attractive person concealing an ailment.

2. **Contradictions Due to Social Roles**: Every individual plays multiple roles in society, and the mask we wear for one role might not fit another. This dynamic creates an interesting interplay, especially when unexpected situations arise. A mother might act differently in the presence of a love interest than she would around her children.

3. **Contradictions from Competing Morals or Goals**: These arise when characters are torn between two conflicting moral imperatives or goals. Historic dramas like those of Antigone or Achilles highlight such core conflicts. These conflicts enhance characterization and deepen the narrative.

4. **Contradictions from Secrets or Deceit**: Characters hiding something can act in ways that seem contradictory until their secret is revealed. This builds tension and curiosity.

5. **Contradictions between Conscious and Unconscious Traits**: Everyone has traits they show to the world and those they hide. Sometimes, the hidden traits overpower and manifest in unpredictable ways, leading to drama.

6. **Dispositional Contradictions**: Characters might inherently possess traits that seem at odds with their overall personality, making them more multifaceted. For example, a brave individual might also be vain, or a young girl might be astoundingly business-savvy.

These contradictions are captivating because they signal us to be alert. They tap into our evolutionary instinct to detect anomalies, making them both compelling and relatable. Contradictions highlight the complexity of human nature and situations, rendering depth to stories and characters.
### Chapter Ten - Serving and Defying the Tyranny of Motive
**Summary:**

The essence of character creation lies in capturing the complexities and unpredictabilities of human nature. Sophocles described his heroes as "wondrous and strange," indicating characters who are dynamic and multifaceted. Crafting a compelling character requires balancing expected behavior with surprising elements. To truly engage the reader, an initial impression of a character must be provided, followed by a series of events that challenge and transform that character.

The core of a character is driven by their desires, which the author dubs the "Tyranny of Motive." It's essential to understand that we can't know everything about a character, much like we can't know everything about another person or even ourselves. The intrigue lies in the mystery, and it's the unknown elements that make characters compelling.

Writers should aim for a balance, understanding their characters enough to portray them authentically, but leaving room for spontaneity and surprise. Over-relying on logic and intellectual understanding can lead to flat, predictable characters. Instead, writers should harness intuition, engaging with their characters in emotionally charged scenarios.

While motivations drive characters, they should not be overly simplistic or overly defined. A well-crafted character's actions arise from their entire personality and history, not just a single motive. Over-explaining characters reduces their appeal. The best characters resonate because they encapsulate the complexities and contradictions inherent in human nature, defying easy explanations and keeping readers engaged and intrigued.
### Chapter Eleven - Dynamic Versus Static: Creating a Biography from Scenes
**Summary**:

Henry James's statement suggests that incidents reveal character, and vice versa. Building upon this concept, Lajos Egri in "The Art of Dramatic Writing" emphasizes the importance of detailed character biographies in three core areas: Physical, Psychological, and Sociological. The author agrees with Egri, but rather than creating a list of character traits, they prefer to visualize these traits through scenes. They believe it's more effective to consider how a character’s physical, psychological, and sociological attributes affect their interactions. The following chapters discuss this method further.

The static facts about a character, like height and eye color, are not as valuable in describing how they act or react. Frank Pierson, a screenwriter, suggested writing scenes outside the main story to explore characters in moments of discomfort or conflict. The author's approach expands on this idea, stressing the importance of envisioning relevant scenes even if they don’t end up in the final piece. This method of exploring characters through scenes is vital because characters are better understood through their actions and words rather than their inner thoughts and feelings.

This understanding aligns with 20th-century philosophy, which posits that a person's identity is constructed more through interaction than through introspection. Actions are binding, they have consequences, and hence, they reveal much about a character. Characters are tested in scenes, and this testing reveals their true nature. While it's essential to know a character’s thoughts and feelings, showing these feelings through their actions is more effective. Ultimately, scenes challenge characters, and it's through these challenges that we see their real desires, decisions, and the depth of their character.
### Chapter Twelve Flesh and Blood and Shoes: The Character's Physical Nature

#### Is Physical Description Necessary? 
**Summary**:

In the past, before the rise of film and TV, detailed physical descriptions in literature were highly valued as they often hinted at a character's inner world. Renowned authors like Joseph Conrad skillfully portrayed a character's soul through their physical descriptions, while Katherine Anne Porter beautifully captured the relationship between a character's inner life and their outward appearance. On the other hand, writers like Elmore Leonard focused more on action and dialog for characterization, believing in the power of readers' imagination. Some writers even purposely limit physical descriptions to allow readers to engage more with the story using their imagination. In screenwriting, physical characterizations can be left to actors and costume designers. Ultimately, what’s more important than precise physical details is how a character's appearance reflects their inner self, influences their behavior, and affects how others perceive and react to them.

**Summary**:

The piece examines how a character's physicality and experiences provide insight into their personality, background, and motivations in a story. 

1. **Senses**: How characters perceive the world through their senses is crucial. Using both external sensations and internal thoughts, writers anchor characters in the real world, making them relatable and deep. Examples include depictions in "Hard Rain Falling" and "The Maltese Falcon."

2. **Sex vs. Gender**: The gender of a character brings up questions of gender roles, expectations, and stereotypes. Characters should be more than just cultural clichés; real people often defy gender norms. This offers rich sources of conflict.

3. **Sexual Attractiveness**: This aspect deals with a character's own perception of their attractiveness and how others perceive them. The characters' feelings about their own appearance can lead to a myriad of emotions and reactions, creating depth and vulnerability. Sexual encounters or experiences shed light on their insecurities and complexities.

4. **Race**: Writers must be cautious and well-informed when portraying characters of different racial backgrounds. Assumptions can lead to stereotypes. The goal is to provide genuine, nuanced depictions.

5. **Age**: A character's age influences how they engage with others and the world. Different ages bring different life experiences, worldviews, regrets, and wisdom.

6. **Health**: Past or current health conditions or injuries can provide significant insights into a character's personality, resilience, and relationships with others. Health can affect a character's emotional landscape.

7. **Deportment and Fashion Sense**: How a character dresses, or their fashion sense, reveals their socio-economic status, personal style, or insecurities. It also reflects how they want to be perceived by others.

In essence, a character's physical attributes, experiences, and personal choices, provide a window into their inner life. Effective characterization involves creating multifaceted beings, rooted in both their internal and external worlds.
#### Physical Description in Screenwriting
**Summary:**

Physical descriptions in screenwriting aren't just about casting. They give insight into a character's personality and how they interact with the world. Effective descriptions are concise but impactful. For instance, in the film "Michael Clayton," the character Marty Bach is described in just a few words, capturing his essence. Similarly, in the "Breaking Bad" pilot, Walter White's description establishes his current state of desperation and danger. Not every screenwriter uses this concise technique, but those who do, like novelists who've dabbled in screenwriting, bring this economical style to their written work. This approach effectively conveys both a character’s exterior and their deeper nature.
### Chapter Thirteen - The Tempest Within: The Character's Psychological Nature

**Summary:**

The psychological understanding of a character is crucial, encompassing their emotions, feelings, fears, passions, and inner conflicts. It's essential to visualize these aspects in specific scenarios, thinking about what events triggered these emotions and how they influence the character's interactions. While the concept of "desire" was discussed earlier, it's emphasized again as central to storytelling. Most stories revolve around a character's pursuit of something they deeply want or need, and the drama emerges from the challenges they face in this quest. Using desire as a central theme doesn't diminish a story's literary or artistic value, as evident in classic works like "The Odyssey," "The Great Gatsby," and many others.

#### Desire
**Summary:**

The essence of many stories lies in the central character's desire and the journey to achieve, possess, or lose it. This theme is foundational and can be seen in countless literary masterpieces like "The Odyssey," "The Great Gatsby," and many more. Such stories are not any "less artistic" because of this recurring theme. While some characters might be unclear about their desires or may have hidden motives, it's vital for the author to maintain clarity about this driving force. Every scene should either move the character closer to or further from their ultimate goal. As the story progresses, understanding the reason behind the character's denial or acknowledgement of their desires becomes crucial. If the author loses sight of this, the story can lose its direction, becoming unfocused and weakening its overall impact.
#### Fear
**Summary:**

Fear encompasses a vast spectrum of emotions, from sheer panic to mild uneasiness. It's an essential element of characterization as it often dictates a character's actions and reactions, often without their conscious awareness. In the face of conflict, characters grapple with both external challenges and their internal fears, be it fear of loss, humiliation, or death. Notably, other emotions, like anger and resentment, can be disguises for underlying fears. For instance, Mickey Scarpato's perceived control over his gambling habit hides his real fear of weakness and impending doom. Similarly, Brian Remy fears what his memory gaps might conceal. To effectively characterize, writers should deeply explore their character's fears, both past and present, and understand how these fears shape their relationships, actions, and avoidances in the narrative.
#### Courage
**Summary:**

Courage, in storytelling, is often depicted as the ability of a character to confront and overcome their fears or challenges. This can manifest in numerous ways, from overt bravery to quieter acts of endurance and patience. Notably, one profound form of courage is the willingness to love, as explored in works like "The Shipping News" and "Brokeback Mountain." Acts of heroism, as demonstrated by Ham in "David Copperfield," show that redemption can be tied to bravery. However, it's essential to recognize and value subtler demonstrations of courage, such as enduring disappointment or practicing restraint in tense situations. Ultimately, the true gauge of courage is the extent of fear it overcomes. To effectively depict a character's courage, writers should first understand the fear they're confronting and craft the narrative from that foundation.
#### Love
**Summary:**

Love, in storytelling, is closely tied to a character's desires. Whether a character possesses, lost, or is still seeking what they love greatly impacts their narrative journey. This is exemplified in "21 Grams," where Cristina Peck's ordinary life is shattered by the sudden loss of her family. Contrary to popular belief, villains too should be portrayed with a depth of emotion, including love, to make them multifaceted and relatable, as seen with characters like Tony Soprano. This duality, where love coexists with other dark emotions or actions, provides depth and contradiction. It's essential not to idealize love, as reality shows that merely possessing love doesn't solve all problems. Both novels like Willa Cather's "My Mortal Enemy" and films like "Love and Other Drugs" explore the complexities of love, where fears and misconceptions often become barriers to genuine connection. In storytelling, it's important to avoid sentimentality and dive into love's genuine challenges, as it enriches the narrative and resonates more profoundly with audiences.
#### Hate
**Summary:**

Hatred in storytelling can provide depth to both antagonists and protagonists. While villains are often characterized by their love, even morally upright individuals can harbor intense resentment. Such emotions can be driven by personal pain or righteousness, as seen in characters like Ruth Fowler in “Killings,” who desires revenge for her son's murder. On the other hand, characters like J. J. Hunsecker in "The Sweet Smell of Success" use disdain as a driving force. Hatred can stem from irrational or unconscious reasons, often rooted in deep-seated fears or personal shame. Characters like Roy Cohn from "Angels in America" or Chauvelin from "The Scarlet Pimpernel" display intense aversion towards those who embody qualities they secretly admire or fear within themselves. This intricate portrayal of hatred enriches a story by highlighting the complexities within characters.
#### Shame
**Summary:**

Shame is a profound emotion that arises when an individual's actions lead to a perceived loss of status or approval within a significant group. It isn't necessarily linked to immoral acts but is more about the fear of loss of love, approval, or esteem. The magnitude of shame can range from minor embarrassments, like an undone zipper at a social gathering, to severe public humiliation. This emotion can drive storylines as it often demands character development or a confrontation with the past. Sports stories, like "The Hustler", and tales of small-town dynamics, as seen in "The Last Picture Show", frequently delve into the concept of shame. For writers, exploring a character's moments of profound shame can be instrumental in understanding their motivations and fears, especially as these moments are deeply intertwined with interpersonal relationships and are therefore compelling in a narrative context.
#### Guilt
**Summary:**

Guilt arises from an individual's perception that they've transgressed their own moral principles, creating a conflict within their conscience. Unlike shame, which is related to external judgments, guilt is a personal, internalized feeling linked to one's own understanding of right and wrong. It can manifest in response to actual wrongdoings, such as acts of cruelty, deceit, or betrayal, or even perceived wrongs where no objective fault exists. Many stories, particularly redemption tales, leverage guilt as a motivator, showcasing characters' struggles with their past actions and their attempts to find atonement. Examples include sports tales like "The Color of Money," where Eddie Felson grapples with betraying his own code of honor, and novels like Kate Atkinson’s "Case Histories", where Jackson Brodie is haunted by a guilt he doesn't logically deserve. For writers, diving deep into a character's guilt, its origins, and consequences provides fertile ground for character development and dynamic storytelling.
#### Forgiveness
**Summary:**

Forgiveness is a complex and multi-faceted aspect of human relationships. Understanding if and when a character has forgiven or been forgiven can provide deep insights into their psyche. While linked to guilt, forgiveness goes beyond it. Movies like "Ordinary People" explore the difficulty of forgiveness, where a mother cannot forgive her surviving son after the death of her favorite child. Similarly, Frederick Busch's "Girls" delves into the tragic irony of forgiveness and self-deception. While contrition is noble, it doesn't always lead to forgiveness, because pain, fear, or self-righteous indignation can inhibit letting go. Genuine forgiveness is hard to portray in drama because it involves balancing sincere remorse from the offender and the genuine release of pain and resentment by the aggrieved. Often, stories depict incomplete or partial forgiveness to maintain believability, as seen in Guy de Maupassant’s “Forgiveness.” Successfully portraying forgiveness in drama requires showing the journey of both the wrongdoer and the wronged, culminating in a moment of mercy, even if it feels a tad unearned or obligated.
#### Failure
**Summary:**

Failure is an integral part of character development. How a character responds to setbacks determines much about their personality and trajectory. Such challenges can either be catalysts for growth and resilience or anchors that lead to bitterness, fear, and diminished ambition. In "Slumdog Millionaire," Jamal's separation from Latika reinforces his determination to find her again, while in "Bringing Out the Dead," Frank Pierce's inability to save Rose drives his obsessive need to rescue others. Characters like Willy Loman and Sidney Falco are haunted by missed opportunities and the overwhelming pressure of success. For storytellers, it's crucial to explore the broader ramifications of a character's failures: who else was affected by their setbacks, and how has the experience shaped their subsequent choices and relationships?

#### Success/Pride
**Summary:**

Understanding a character's moments of success is as important as comprehending their failures. Knowing when a character achieved something and felt pride can provide insight into their resilience and confidence in the story's challenges. It's important to consider if a character could openly celebrate their achievements or if they had to downplay them due to societal or situational factors. The balance between pride from success and past shame can be complex. While achievements can mask previous humiliations, the tension between pride and shame might make a character anxious about their reputation, potentially leading to vanity or an inflated sense of self-worth. Legendary basketball coach John Wooden advised valuing character over reputation. Some characters might feel indifferent or even ashamed of successes that are undeserved. This is seen in stories warning against envy or the dangers of unthoughtful wishes. Characters like Helmholtz Watson in "Brave New World" don't take pride in their gifts, causing confusion in those less talented. Additionally, success can be a downfall for some, as shown by characters like Dick Diver in "Tender Is the Night" and Macbeth.
#### Religion/Spirituality
**Summary and Clarification:**

Religion and spirituality play a pivotal role in many people's lives, shaping their beliefs, actions, and how they interact with the world. Despite the significant influence of religion, many writers overlook its depiction in their characters. However, this overlook doesn't always relate to personal beliefs, as even atheists like James Joyce have skillfully portrayed the spiritual practices of their characters. For instance, in *God’s Pocket*, the devout Minnie Devine Edwards seeks solace and guidance from her Bible during a troubling time. Canadian author Brian Moore, deeply rooted in his Catholic beliefs, often writes about faith as an enduring search for unwavering love, yet doesn't shy away from showcasing its potential for narrow-mindedness.

When crafting a character, understanding their spiritual journey can provide depth. Essential questions to consider include the character's upbringing and its religious influences, their current practice or deviation from it, moments of lost or newfound faith, and the influences behind any shifts. Some renowned figures like Augustine, T. S. Eliot, and Mary Karr have turned to faith during adulthood, often as a remedy for personal struggles or voids. Determining a character's ethical compass, the sins they might commit, or those they'd avoid, their perceptions of life's purpose, beliefs in an afterlife or supernatural entities, and their overall worldview can offer insight into their actions and decisions.

For characters who lean more towards agnosticism or atheism, understanding what molded their moral framework, such as family or education, is equally crucial. Their beliefs, whether grounded in science, materialism, cynicism, or nihilism, shape how they perceive and interact with the world. Regardless of one's personal stance on faith, any serious writer should recognize the importance of these spiritual questions, given their profound impact on human life and society.
#### Food
**Summary and Clarification:**

The role of food in a character’s life can offer profound insights into their psyche, representing deeper desires and unfulfilled needs, as well as serving as symbols of love, comfort, memory, and culture. For instance, Charlie Resnick from John Harvey’s works exhibits his loneliness and yearning for pleasure through his meticulous sandwich-making rituals. Minnie Devine from *God’s Pocket* uses food preparation as a form of prayer and relief, revealing her deep-seated anxieties. James Joyce portrays a character, Lenehan, whose hunger and eventual satisfaction with a plate of peas become emblematic of his broader yearnings. Similarly, Jim Harrison's writings often delve into the pure pleasure of cooking and eating.

Food, however, is more than just sustenance. Its cultural and emotional ties can recall memories from one’s childhood, signify love, camaraderie, and provide solace. Preparing and enjoying a meal can be as therapeutic as the act of eating itself. The senses of smell and taste, evoked by food, can be challenging to depict in writing but are powerful in character development. Food can define a sense of home or belonging, as seen with characters like Resnick and Minnie Devine, or emphasize the absence of such feelings, like Lenehan’s portrayal. For many, including Jim Harrison's characters, food is a momentary reprieve from life's challenges.

For writers, envisioning their character's relationship with food—what they eat, how they cook, and who they share meals with—can be a defining tool in bringing depth and authenticity to their stories.
#### Death
**Summary and Clarification:**

Death, as a theme, is crucial in storytelling and offers deep insights into a character's psyche. As per Christopher Vogler, every hero must confront mortality, whether metaphorically or through the actual demise of a close relationship, to make their story meaningful. This confrontation often demands a personal transformation, reshaping one's identity in the face of such profound loss.

Cheryl Strayed's memoir, "Wild," exemplifies this transformation. Strayed's 1100-mile journey on the Pacific Coast Trail was her way to confront the profound grief and suffering she felt due to her mother's death, her family falling apart, and a challenging divorce. Her isolation allowed her to accept the raw pain of these experiences, redefine her self-worth, and shed the coping mechanisms she'd previously relied on.

Death forces individuals to confront the ultimate truth of existence: its impermanence. The complexity of life often dissolves when faced with this inevitable end. The sense that life always continues gets disrupted by death, making its occurrence feel unnatural and disturbing. Death underscores the inexorable march of time and the inevitable loss of everything.

Many commercial stories fail to satisfy because they either trivialize death or avoid its true implications, aiming for happy endings. This is highlighted in Syd Field's advice on avoiding "downer endings" for Hollywood's financial gains, a tactic that eventually erodes the cultural and emotional depth of storytelling. A deep and genuine portrayal of death in fiction resonates more with audiences because it's an unavoidable truth in human life. As a writer, it's crucial to ensure that characters feel the weight and mystery of death as profoundly as real people do.
### Chapter Fourteen - The Teeming World: The Character's Sociological Nature
**Summary and Clarification:**

A person's psychology determines their internal world, while sociology dictates how they interact and navigate the external world, filled with other individuals. The chapter's scope on sociology is as vast as the previous one on psychology. To understand this, one should break it down rather than try to grasp everything at once. When examining the relationship between two people, you can probe many of the same inquiries you'd pose to a singular character: their highest moments of joy, fear, shame, guilt, success, and forgiveness. This perspective is essential to understand and apply the following suggestions.
#### Family
**Summary and Clarification:**

Family dynamics play a crucial role in determining a character's identity, motivations, and struggles. Different family members can impact a character's psychological development and self-perception.

- **Parents**: A character's relationship with their parents, especially during their early years, lays the foundation for their core values, fears, and aspirations. The presence or absence of a parent can lead to pivotal life moments that deeply influence the character's growth. For instance, interactions with a father can range from memories of fondness to moments of neglect or even abuse. A mother's influence can be even more profound, given her emotional and sensual connection to a child. Mothers can be nurturing, indifferent, or even oppressive.

- **Grandparents**: They can serve as secondary caretakers, sources of wisdom, or reminders of family legacy. Their involvement (or lack thereof) can shape a character's understanding of family history and traditions.

- **Siblings**: Siblings often play a significant role in a character's life, serving as allies, rivals, or both. They can shape one's perspective on competition, love, loyalty, and betrayal. A character's position within the sibling hierarchy (oldest, middle, youngest) can also impact their worldview and responsibilities.

Several classic and contemporary literary works and films explore the depths of these relationships, showcasing their influence on a character's journey. For instance:

- **Orphans in literature**: Orphans like those in Charles Dickens' works often navigate the world without the baggage of family ties, making them versatile protagonists.
  
- **Influential mothers**: Some works highlight the overpowering influence of mothers, with stories such as Junot Díaz’s "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao" and Janet Fitch’s "White Oleander" underscoring their lasting impact.

- **Sibling dynamics**: Stories from "The Godfather" to "The Fighter" delve into the complexities of sibling relationships, with love, rivalry, and betrayal interwoven into the narrative.

In summary, a character's family background, whether it's the bond with parents, grandparents, or siblings, offers a rich tapestry of emotions and events that can be mined for compelling storytelling. Exploring these relationships can lend depth, conflict, and authenticity to a character's journey.
#### Spouse
**Summary & Clarification**:

*Marriage in Fiction and Reality:*

Marriage is a complex and profound relationship that presents both intimacy and conflicts. It is a bond that begins with romantic fervor and then evolves into a familial connection, bringing with it both the highs and lows of friendship, family, and sexual passion. Marriage can create a tug-of-war between commitment and desire, loyalty and freedom, stability and adventure.

Literature is abundant with depictions of marriages, ranging from ones filled with conflict to those defined by love and compromise. Examples include troubled marriages like George and Martha in "Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" to more affectionate ones like Tom and Gerri in "Another Year". Despite the richness of literary examples, writers are also encouraged to seek inspiration from real-life marriages.

Tolstoy's statement about happy families doesn't necessarily apply to marriages, as each marriage is unique. Within every marital bond lies the central question of the sacrifices made to keep the relationship intact and whether these sacrifices are worth the resulting gains.

The story "The Room" by William Trevor illustrates the nuances of love and marriage. Katherine remains with her husband Phair, even after he's accused of a crime related to an affair. Despite her profound love for him, she finds solace in another man. While her lover might return to his spouse, Katherine acknowledges that her marriage has reached its end. She recognizes that sometimes, even profound love isn't sufficient to sustain a relationship.

In essence, the depiction of marriage, either in fiction or reality, revolves around the qualities of love, commitment, sacrifice, and personal desires.
#### Friends
**Summary & Clarification**:

**Friendship in Literature and Reality**:

- **Philosophical Basis**: Plato saw friendship as a bond unique to all others. It is freely chosen, maintained by mutual consent, and often exists without the complications of family ties or sexual attraction.
  
- **Function**: Friendships often provide support when relationships with families or lovers become strained.

- **Literary Representations**: There are numerous depictions of friendships in literature:
    - *Bouvard et Pecuchet* by Flaubert showcases the bond between two clerks who, despite numerous farcical adventures due to their prejudices and limitations, remain friends.
    - *Deliverance* by James Dickey delves into the competitive insecurities intrinsic to male friendships. The trials the characters face expose underlying tensions and their lack of preparedness.
    - Friendships in TV shows, from *Laverne and Shirley* to *The Big Bang Theory*, underscore the balance of affection, competition, and antagonism.
    
- **Cross-Gender Friendships**:
    - There's a stereotype suggesting that men and women can't truly be platonic friends without underlying romantic or sexual tension. However, such relationships can be rich and multifaceted, making them ripe for storytelling.
    - Jane Austen often delved into this, though many of her friendships evolved into romantic relationships, like Elinor Dashwood and Colonel Brandon in *Sense and Sensibility*.
    - Sometimes, these friendships might be tinted with sexual tension, like in *The African Queen* or *Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison*. At times, only one party may harbor romantic feelings, as seen in Alfred Hitchcock’s *Vertigo*.
    - The novel *The Chess Player* explores the intricate relationship between Hélène, a Corsican maid, and her American widower chess tutor. Their bond is cerebrally intimate with sexual tension, yet remains Platonic.
    
- **Workplace Friendships**:
    - The workplace is a common setting for cross-gender friendships. While some result in romance, others manage to maintain their platonic nature. Series like *The X-Files* and *Moonlighting* showcase male-female detective duos.
    - Tana French’s *In the Woods* captures the evolution of the friendship between two detectives, Rob Ryan and Cassie Maddox. Their bond deepens throughout the story, but a single night alters their dynamic forever.
    
In essence, friendships, whether same-gender or cross-gender, are rich tapestries of human emotion and experience. Their complexities provide ample ground for storytelling across various mediums.
#### Name
**Summary & Clarification**:

**The Power of Names in Character Creation**:

- **Role of Names**: A name, just like a body, persists over time and offers a character a sense of coherence and identity. But unlike a body, a name is given to you by others and is a reflection of how you fit into the societal framework. 

- **Character Identity**: A character's name is a pivotal decision for writers as it establishes a consistent identity. When a name perfectly aligns with the essence of a character, it can bring the character's personality and nature to the forefront, often substituting for lengthy descriptions.
  
- **Examples**:
    - TV Series *The Wire* has characters like Jimmy McNulty, Stringer Bell, and “Proposition Joe” Stewart. Their names are often evocative and paint a picture.
    - Novelist Richard Price offers characters like Rocco Klein and Strike Dunham, which are suggestive.
    - Memorable names from various works include Chili Palmer from *Get Shorty*, Nurse Ratched from *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest*, and Rooster Cogburn from *True Grit*. 
    - Contrarily, Hemingway often chose simple names like Robert Jordan or Jake Barnes, which were straightforward but conveyed his intended message.
    
- **Purpose**: Writers should aim for a name that creates a distinct mental or emotional imprint of the character. This aids in ensuring continuity and consistency throughout the narrative.

- **Challenge of Common Names**: Ordinary names, like Jim Williams or Jane Smith, can pose an interesting challenge for writers. These names don't immediately provide a distinct image, thus pushing the writer to ensure the character transcends the simplicity of their name. Such characters might evolve, but their names remain constant, emphasizing that there's more depth to them than their name suggests.
#### Class
**Summary & Clarification**:

**The Role of Class in Storytelling**:

- **Perception of Class in the U.S.**: Despite Americans' belief in a largely classless society, class divisions are very much evident. People are always aware of their standings on the socio-economic ladder, aspiring to climb higher or fearing the fall.

- **Importance in Character Development**: Knowing a character’s socio-economic status can impact how they navigate their world. Questions arise like:
    - What doors open or close based on their class?
    - How do they perceive and interact with those of different classes?
    - Are they stable, improving, or declining in their socio-economic status?
    - Do they experience feelings of resentment, judgment, or discomfort based on their class?

- **Scenic Illustration**: Class disparities and tensions can lead to compelling scenes. Examples might include conflicts with colleagues from different social backgrounds, the disintegration of friendships due to economic opportunities, or moments of embarrassment when trying to impress someone of a higher class.

- **Case Study - The Town**: The 2010 film adaptation of Chuck Hogan’s *Prince of Thieves* demonstrates class dynamics. The movie showcases the tension between the blue-collar Charlestown natives (Townies) and the more affluent newcomers (Toonies). The protagonist, Doug MacRay, yearns for an escape from crime and his community's suffocating old allegiances. This desire drives conflict with his accomplices who remain deeply rooted in their criminal ways.

- **Crime Stories & Class Tension**: Crime narratives have long been a medium for exploring class tensions. From early films like *Little Caesar* and *The Public Enemy* to pulp stories by writers like Dashiell Hammett and Horace McCoy, class conflict is a recurring theme. In the 1940s, crime films by European expatriates, 1950s noir tales, and contemporary crime stories from writers like Don Winslow and Laura Lippmann have continued to illustrate the harsh realities of economic disparities, class envy, and the pitfalls of unchecked capitalism.
#### Work
**Summary & Clarification**:

**The Significance of a Character's Occupation**:

- **Work Defines a Character**: Stella Adler emphasized that understanding a character's profession is vital. Occupations not only provide context for their daily activities but also offer insights into their personalities, relationships, aspirations, and challenges.

- **Profession-Driven Challenges**: A character's job role can bring with it specific struggles, such as dealing with superiors, coworkers, clients, or competitors. Questions arise: 
    - How competent is the character in their role?
    - How secure do they feel in their job?
    - Is this job their passion or just a means to an end?
    - What challenges or confrontations arise from their job?

- **Case Studies**:
    - *Up in the Air*: Ryan Bingham’s role as a corporate layoff specialist highlights his aversion to personal commitment. He is always the one letting others go, emphasizing his control and detachment.
    
    - *Bringing Out the Dead*: Frank Pierce is a paramedic haunted by his perceived failures. While he possesses technical expertise, he grapples with guilt over a patient he couldn't save, showcasing the emotional toll of his profession.
    
    - *The 25th Hour*: Frank Slattery, a bond trader, is defined by his competitive nature, fears, and ambitions, all driven by his Wall Street profession. On the other hand, Jakob Elinsky is an English teacher, whose interactions at his school hint at his insecurities and unspoken desires.

**Clarification**: A character’s job can profoundly influence their actions, relationships, and self-perception. It becomes a window to their soul, revealing not just what they do, but who they are and what drives them. By exploring characters in their professional settings and understanding the dynamics of their workplace, we get a more profound insight into their psyche and motivations.
#### Education
**Summary & Clarification**:

**The Influence of Education on Character**:

- **Beyond Formal Education**: Rather than just knowing the educational level of a character (like if they graduated high school), it’s essential to understand the impact of individual educators and peers on the character. Did any of them inspire, encourage, or conversely, discourage or belittle the character?

- **Significance of Educators**: From childhood to young adulthood, teachers play pivotal roles in shaping our views, ambitions, and self-esteem. Novels and films such as *Goodbye, Mr. Chips*, *The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie*, and *Dead Poets Society*, highlight the profound influence educators can have, both positively and negatively.

- **Education's Social and Economic Impact**: A character's level of education can determine their socioeconomic standing and how they navigate social dynamics. Key considerations include:
    - How they relate to individuals with varying educational backgrounds.
    - The kind of jokes they make and the understanding of their peer group.
    - Their perceived intellectual status in relation to others.
    - The potential they believe they've reached or can reach in their careers based on their education. 

**Clarification**: The character's education is not just about the degrees or qualifications they possess. It's deeply tied to their personal experiences, the mentors and peers they encountered, and the resultant beliefs and perceptions they hold about themselves and the world. This understanding can shape their ambitions, relationships, and self-worth.
#### Geography
**Summary & Clarification**:

**The Role of Geography in Character Development**:

- **Significance of Place**: A character's upbringing and choice of residence deeply influence their identity, social norms, and values. The community they grow up in or choose to live in can mold their inner beliefs, moral stance, and sense of belonging.

- **Impact on Storytelling**: Many stories are intrinsically tied to their geographical settings, serving as crucial elements to the narrative. For example:
    - *Slumdog Millionaire* is rooted in the slums of Mumbai.
    - *Up in the Air* revolves around transient locations like airports and hotels, illustrating Ryan's aversion to permanence.
    - *The Ice Harvest* is anchored in Wichita, Kansas.
    - Other novels like *Bag Men* and works by Colin Harrison are deeply connected to their respective cities, Boston and New York.

- **Researching the Place**: If a story is heavily dependent on a specific location, it's vital for a writer to delve into firsthand accounts or consult individuals familiar with that place. This helps in authentically representing the nuances, cultural references, and idiosyncrasies of that location.

- **Cultural Markers**: Food and music are vital cultural elements that can help establish a sense of place. For instance, the TV series *Treme*, set in New Orleans, prominently features regional cuisine and music to capture the city's essence. The kind of music a character grew up with, be it Patsy Cline, Tito Puente, or Beethoven, can provide insights into their emotional responses, cultural bearings, and even their internal rhythm.

**Clarification**: Geography is not just about the physical setting but encapsulates the cultural, social, and emotional aspects tied to that place. It shapes a character's experiences, memories, and worldview, making it essential for writers to represent it authentically.
#### Home
**Summary & Clarification**:

**The Concept of "Home" in Character Development**:

- **Definition of Home**: The concept of "home" in storytelling isn't just about a physical location. It delves deeper into where a character feels they belong, emotionally and spiritually.

- **Character Exploration Questions**:
    - Does the character reside in their perceived "home" or feel alienated in their current location?
    - How do others perceive them based on where they come from?
    - How have their origins influenced their beliefs, speech patterns, aspirations, and biases?
    - If their true "home" is elsewhere, do they yearn for it? Is returning an option, or is it obstructed by events like scandals or tragedies?
    - Have they embraced their new environment, or do they find it unsatisfying?
    - What sacrifices or journeys did they undergo to reach their current place?

- **Examples in Narratives**:
    - In *Up in the Air*, Ryan's unease with staying in one place reveals his character's essence. His evolving desire for a genuine home becomes central to his story.
    - In *Samaritan*, Ray Mitchell returns to his hometown in New Jersey, only to confront hidden secrets when he gets brutally attacked.
    - Quoyle in *The Shipping News* is a man without a sense of belonging until he relocates to Newfoundland with his daughters after his wife's death, gradually feeling more at home due to the influence of the local community.
    - Frodo's return to the Shire after the War of the Ring demonstrates that even familiar places can feel alien after traumatic experiences. His eventual departure with Gandalf showcases his inability to find solace in his original home.

**Clarification**: The concept of "home" goes beyond mere geography. It's an intricate blend of emotional connections, past experiences, and personal identities. For characters in storytelling, their relationship with "home" can reveal a lot about their past, present desires, and future trajectories.
#### To What 'Tribe' Does My Character Belong?
**Summary & Clarification**:

**The Concept of a Character's "Tribe"**:

- **Definition of Tribe**: A "tribe" in character development refers to a specific group or community with which a character identifies. It encompasses the collective cultural, moral, social, political, and other norms the character has absorbed and practiced.

- **Character Exploration Questions**:
    - With whom does the character identify or feel a deep connection?
    - How has the tribe's influence molded the character's behaviors, beliefs, and principles?
    - What are the character's boundaries within this tribe? What would push them to rebel against or leave the tribe?
    - How are the character's affiliations with the tribe challenged during the story's progression?

- **Examples in Various Settings**:
    - **Work**: Places of employment often form tribes, such as corporate cultures, country clubs, and college campuses.
    - **Emergency Services**: Police forces operate as individuals within a collective, with distinct individuality but united defense against external threats. Firefighters, conversely, act and respond collectively.
    - **Combat**: Soldiers form deep bonds due to shared intense experiences in battle.
    - **Society**: Mothers in playgrounds or members of political parties can be examples of tribes in social contexts. Tom Perrotta's "Little Children" showcases the unique dynamics of motherhood, while political parties signify a broader sense of belonging despite potential internal disagreements.

**Clarification**: The idea of a character's "tribe" delves deep into the affiliations and communities that shape a character's identity, behavior, and worldview. It's not about gathering trivial information, but about understanding and visualizing the significant events and influences that define the character within the story's context. Not every character needs an exhaustive breakdown of their "tribal" affiliations, but recognizing these can offer richer depth and potentially guide the story in novel directions. The extent of this exploration is at the discretion of the storyteller.
### Chapter Fifteen - Picking a Fight: Politics
**Summary & Clarification**:

**Politics in Character Development**:

1. **Introduction**:
    - Politics is as pivotal as psychology and sociology in character development.
    - Avoiding political discourse in writing can be a missed opportunity, as politics deeply intertwines with core values and vulnerabilities.

2. **Significance of Political Beliefs**:
    - Political convictions express our core values, vulnerabilities, hopes, fears, and ideals.
    - Avoiding political discussions in writing can be due to the fear of confrontational edginess and the potential for slipping into clichés or preachy monologues.

3. **Character and Politics**:
    - Don’t judge characters by their politics. Embrace diverse political beliefs, even if they contradict the writer's personal stance.
    - Characters should represent beliefs and values, not a writer's personal monologue or agenda.
    - Good political drama, like "The West Wing", brings depth by testing its characters.
  
4. **Lakoff’s Moral Politics**: 
    - Political beliefs are framed around metaphors of family and parenting.
        - **Conservatives**: Adhere to a "Strict Father" model emphasizing discipline, self-reliance, and obedience to authority.
        - **Liberals**: Lean towards a "Nurturing Parent" model prioritizing communication, nurturance, and empathy.
    - Recognizing and embracing these differences can foster understanding and prevent falling into clichés.
  
5. **Local vs. National Politics**:
    - Engaging with politics at a local level might be more telling about a character, as local issues are felt more intensely.
    - How characters engage with local issues—whether they're activists, recluses, or leaders—offers insight into their personalities and priorities.
  
6. **Politics and Relationships**:
    - Politics can amplify personal relationships, as shown in Jess Walter’s "Citizen Vince". Political engagements can bring out hidden aspects of characters or complicate their relationships.

**Clarification**: Political beliefs and affiliations are not just markers on a character's profile but deeply ingrained parts of their personality, values, and life choices. For writers, addressing politics should not be about pushing their personal beliefs but about genuinely exploring a character's motivations, vulnerabilities, and the complexities these beliefs introduce to their relationships and personal journeys.
### Chapter Sixteen - Quirks ,Tics, and Bad Habits
**Summary and Clarification**:

The section of the book delves into character traits that bring characters to life in writing. These are often unconscious or peculiar habits, physical expressions, or eccentricities that help paint a vivid image of a character's personality. These seemingly small traits can provide deep insights into a character's inner world.

1. **Types of Traits**:
   - **Physical Expressions**: Examples include a specific type of laugh, a twitch, or an anxious fluttering of the eyelids.
   - **Conscious Habits**: These might be habits like checking one’s appearance in a mirror or tapping a pen.
   - **Eccentricities**: Quirks like quoting proverbs out of context or using foreign phrases in casual conversation.

2. **Observation for Inspiration**: The author suggests observing people in cafes or shops to note unique behaviors.

3. **Literary Examples**:
   - In Robert Altman’s "3 Women", a character has the peculiar habit of catching her skirt in her car door.
   - In David Benioff’s "City of Thieves", twins have the talent to fart in harmony.

4. **Risk of Traits**: Using such distinguishing habits can sometimes have a comical effect which might not always be intended. However, these traits can also add depth and complexity to characters. For instance, in Richard Price’s "Lush Life", a detective uses people’s misinterpretation of his squinting to his advantage.

5. **Relevance to Central Characters**: These traits can be more than just idiosyncratic fillers. They can reflect deeper psychological nuances. Like Uriah Heep’s "I’m so 'umble" is not just a quirky phrase; it hides his true intentions.

6. **Prompts for Writers**: The section provides prompts to help writers flesh out their characters:
   - What irritates the character?
   - Any childhood pleasure they still indulge in?
   - A favorite joke or curse word?
   - Their favorite clothing item?
   - The last movie or book that impacted them?

The essence is that these traits, while appearing superficial, can be linked deeply to a character's individuality and emotions. When used thoughtfully, these details enhance the character portrayal, making them relatable and distinct.

## PART III - Roles

### Chapter Seventeen - Meaning and Its Messenger: The Protagonist and the Premise

**SUMMARIZED & CLARIFIED:**

**Choosing the Protagonist:**

As a story starts to take shape, a crucial decision involves determining the central character, or the protagonist. This decision may not always be straightforward. Some stories might focus on a pivotal event and its effects on multiple characters, as seen in works like "Bel Canto" by Ann Patchett or "A Visit from the Goon Squad" by Jennifer Egan. While some narratives might revolve around pairs or trios of characters, often, one character will become central because they:

1. Act most directly in response to the story's initiating event.
2. Show the deepest motivation to act.
3. Have the most at risk within the narrative.
4. Garner the most empathy from the reader or audience.
5. Stand as the crux of the story’s moral theme.

While the term "hero" is often used, "protagonist" might be more apt due to its neutrality. Characters like Walter White in "Breaking Bad" or Don Draper in "Mad Men" are protagonists, not necessarily heroes in the traditional sense. For beginners, focusing on one protagonist can help simplify and give clarity to the story, emphasizing who the tale is most concerned with.

**The Protagonist's Desire:**

The protagonist's desire is central to the narrative. This isn't just a superficial wish but rather a profound yearning, often rooted in deeper human needs like love, recognition, understanding, or a sense of belonging. When these deep-seated desires are opposed or denied, the character's entire essence should feel threatened. If readers or an audience find themselves disconnected from a protagonist, the reason often lies in the writer's portrayal of the character's desires, the reasons behind those desires, and the lengths the character is willing to go to achieve them. If feedback suggests a lack of connection to the protagonist, writers should reevaluate and deepen these aspects of the character.

#### Summoning the Will
**SUMMARIZED & CLARIFIED:**

The desires of a protagonist in a story must be deeply rooted, reflecting their core values and motivations. This drive stems from the inherent human need to find meaning, especially when confronted with the inevitability of mortality. The pursuit of this meaning is often portrayed through the character's deep-seated needs, desires, ambitions, or goals. These desires go beyond simple wants; they resonate with profound human yearnings like love, validation, understanding, and security. When these desires are jeopardized or denied, it should deeply affect the character, emphasizing the high stakes involved. If these stakes aren't portrayed authentically, readers might struggle to connect with the protagonist. Thus, if feedback suggests a disconnect with the central character, writers should reevaluate:

1. The clarity of the protagonist's desire.
2. The underlying reasons for this desire.
3. The moral and emotional challenges the character faces in pursuing this desire.
#### Framing the Conflict
**SUMMARIZED & CLARIFIED:**

For effective storytelling, the conflict between the protagonist and the opposing force needs to be framed aptly, ensuring the outcome remains uncertain until the story's conclusion. This concept, termed the "Unity of Opposites" by Lajos Egri, emphasizes that two opposing moral forces must clash, with no possibility of compromise.

Beyond merely understanding the protagonist's desires and obstacles, storytelling is fundamentally a moral endeavor. Characters make decisions with consequences that align with their ideals and bear the repercussions of these choices. A successful story presents a moral insight for the audience, derived from the clash of the protagonist's desires with opposing forces.

In each story scene, the protagonist and opposing force engage in a continual tug-of-war, with the balance of power shifting back and forth. This cycle of "attack" and "counterattack" builds the tension and escalates until a climactic final showdown where a decisive victor emerges.

The protagonist plays a crucial role in delivering the story's moral message. This "meaning" is primarily experienced emotionally by the audience before being understood intellectually. The "premise" of the story encapsulates its moral message and centers primarily on the protagonist. It delves into the virtues or vices that drive the narrative and evaluates why they triumph or falter.

Unlike static themes, the premise ties moral outcomes with story events. It's crucial to pinpoint the premise after knowing the story's ending, allowing it to guide revisions, ensuring that the storyline remains compelling and feels organic. The premise aids in refining the drama, but the real essence lies in the unfolding action and its characters. Avoid forcing a pre-decided moral onto the story, as genuine storytelling emerges from genuine characters and their evolving conflicts.
#### Working Backward --Conceiving the Premise from the Abstract to the Specific
**SUMMARIZED & CLARIFIED:**

Effective storytelling demands a well-defined conflict, placing a significant obstacle between the protagonist and their goals. Lajos Egri terms the struggle between contrasting, non-negotiable desires as the "Unity of Opposites." For a story to be captivating, two antagonistic forces must engage, ultimately leading to one overpowering the other without room for compromise.

A compelling narrative goes beyond just identifying the desires of the protagonist; it's a moral journey. Characters take actions based on their aspirations, facing consequences for their decisions. The climax becomes impactful when it brings a moral realization for readers or viewers, regardless of whether the characters acknowledge it.

The "Unity of Opposites" ensures both sides have morally justifiable reasons, creating a dynamic of continuous 'attacks' and 'counterattacks.' This back-and-forth intensifies, culminating in a decisive end where one side dominates, signaling the definitive conclusion of the conflict.

The protagonist, central to the narrative, carries and conveys this moral revelation. Instead of a clear-cut moral lesson, like those in Aesop's fables, the essence of a story is primarily experiential, appealing to our emotions. To truly grasp a story means to understand not just the fundamental wants and the obstacles but the deeper moral, emotional, and thematic undertones derived from the plot.

The "premise" encapsulates the story's moral statement, distinctly focused on the protagonist. While a "theme" might remain broad, a "premise" merges moral outcomes with specific narrative events. It pinpoints the primary virtues or vices relevant to the story's conclusion, elaborating on their rise or fall. This premise is clarified and refined as the story progresses, especially once the ending becomes evident. 

During revisions, the premise helps streamline scenes and boosts dramatic tension. However, it's crucial to remember that the value of a premise rests in the unfolding events and characters, especially the protagonist. Storytellers should avoid forcing a pre-set moral onto a narrative. Genuine storytelling evolves from genuine characters and their inherent conflicts.
#### The Personal Nature of the Premise
**SUMMARIZED & CLARIFIED:**

Selecting a premise is a deeply personal decision, reflecting both the protagonist's and the writer's moral stance. Pursuing a theme without genuine belief can result in clichéd, unconvincing storytelling. For writers to truly connect with their narrative, they should consider scenes from various media that deeply resonate with them, evoking strong emotions. Analyzing such scenes isn't just about understanding the craft, but recognizing personal themes that touch one's core. These themes represent a writer's unique strength and will often be embodied by the protagonists in their stories.

In a world where ironic detachment is popular, expressing genuine care and emotion might seem out of place. However, impactful storytelling requires deep investment. While a writer might employ detachment to craft engaging scenes, it's vital that their protagonist, at some juncture, feels and acts with deep passion and determination. This intensity is not only crucial for the character but also for the writer's authentic engagement with the story.

### Chapter Eighteen - The Challenge of Change: Three Protagonist Questions

#### The Mysterious Necessity of Change
**SUMMARIZED & CLARIFIED:**

In Jim Harrison's novella, the protagonist's journey from a capitalist to a cook symbolizes the mysterious nature of change. Some modern narratives challenge the traditional structure of plot, suggesting that life is random and actions don't always lead to clear conclusions. However, even in such tales, there's often an underlying revelation or emotional shift. Despite arguments against structured stories, humans are inherently sense-making creatures. We naturally seek coherence and meaning, even amidst chaos.

Stories generally have an element of change, whether it's a shift in perception, attitude, or circumstance. Even in tales where characters appear static, a revelation often occurs, offering insights into their world or psyche. This idea of change, or the resistance to it, is a consistent theme in various story genres, from love stories to crime narratives. It reflects the tension between our desire for stability and the unpredictable nature of life. 

In traditional stories, like the Arthurian legends, the narrative captures the struggle between ideals and the ever-shifting human desires. Similarly, other genres, whether bildungsroman, crime stories, or love tales, underline the inevitability of change. True-to-life stories inevitably delve into change, with characterization depicting individuals navigating these shifts. The protagonist is often the character most impacted by this transformation. But what about characters who remain unchanged?
#### What of So-Called Steadfast Characters
**SUMMARIZED & CLARIFIED:**

The concept of a "Steadfast Character" revolves around characters that appear to remain consistent in their ideals or goals despite challenges. Lajos Egri posited that genuine characters must change when faced with significant conflict. However, there are iconic characters, such as Antigone and Romeo, who seem defined by their unwavering commitment to a principle or love.

Yet, it's essential to differentiate between external actions and internal shifts. While a steadfast character might not change their behavior or central motive, their emotional landscape, understanding, or perspective can evolve. Even if these characters don't physically change their course of action, their internal struggle or the depth of their understanding might shift.

Antigone, for example, doesn't waver in her commitment to burying her brother but grapples internally with the moral implications of her choice. Similarly, Romeo's love remains constant, but his comprehension of its depth and consequences grows as the story unfolds.

In stories like "The Sun Also Rises" and "Leaving Las Vegas," characters might not undergo transformative behavioral changes, but their decisions, whether to change or to stay the same, create a dramatic impact. In essence, the decision not to change is a form of change in itself, given its inherent dramatic implications.
#### Distinguishing Growth from Transformation
**SUMMARIZED & CLARIFIED:**

Character development in stories can manifest in two primary ways: growth and transformation.

1. **Transformation:** Involves a fundamental shift in a character's understanding or perception of themselves or their life. This profound change is often motivated by a significant realization or an epiphany, sometimes deemed a "Change-or-Die Moment" or "Crisis of Insight." In this scenario, characters confront a major flaw, mistake, or limitation in their self-concept. Examples include characters like Precious and Joe Buck who undergo dramatic changes due to insights. Another character, Brett from "The Sun Also Rises," has a realization but doesn't act on it. Essentially, transformation is akin to tearing down a wall or taking a turn in a different direction.

2. **Growth:** Represents a more gradual change in a character's abilities, confidence, or virtues. Instead of addressing a foundational flaw or limitation, the character enhances or expands on existing qualities. Examples can be found in stories where a protagonist becomes stronger, wiser, or more resilient through conflict. Growth might be likened to digging deeper or accelerating forward.

However, growth and transformation aren't mutually exclusive. Characters can experience aspects of both, resembling overlapping circles in a Venn diagram. Their development might require them to both address deep-seated issues (transformation) and to strengthen their virtues (growth).

A helpful approach to understanding a protagonist's journey might be through the lens of the core questions the story poses:
1. Can I get what I want?
2. Who am I?
3. What do I need to change about myself to achieve my desires?

Exploring these questions can shed light on whether a character's arc leans more towards growth, transformation, or a combination of both.
#### Can I get What I Want?
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Slumdog Millionaire Plot Summary:** 
The film "Slumdog Millionaire" follows Jamal Malik, an 18-year-old from the Juhu slum of Mumbai, who competes on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" and is one question away from winning. Due to his underprivileged background, he's suspected of cheating and is detained by the police. As Jamal is interrogated, the audience is shown flashbacks of events from his life, which ironically provided him the answers to the quiz show questions. Central to Jamal's life are his brother Salim and his love, Latika. The trio faces various challenges, and Salim eventually becomes involved in crime, even forcing Jamal to leave Latika behind. When Jamal eventually finds them, he learns Latika is being held captive. To rescue her, he vows to win the game show she adores. By the climax, despite not knowing the final answer, Jamal guesses correctly. His victory is both monetary and in reuniting with Latika, though it's marred by Salim's tragic end.

**Main Discussion Points:** 
1. **Storytelling Form:** This type of story, where the protagonist strives against external forces without a significant internal transformation, is rooted in the tradition of Romantic and Victorian novels. Such narratives often revolve around the central question of whether the protagonist can achieve their goal. They don't focus on self-doubt or internal conflict but rather on external challenges.

2. **Moral Theme:** Most stories in this tradition assert that through determination, perseverance, and skill, one can realize their dreams or achieve their goals.

3. **Conflict and Resolution:** Conflict is essential to such stories. Achieving a goal often comes at a cost. This "cost" is examined in moments of tension when the protagonist seems on the brink of failure but then finds a way to succeed. Such stories may suggest that despite the high price, the pursuit was worth it. If the cost overshadows the reward, the story becomes a cautionary tale.

4. **Wider Context:** The broader discussion is on the universality and popularity of this type of narrative. The fundamental question it asks is, "Can I get what I want?" Depending on the nature of the story (e.g., prowar vs. antiwar, crime caper vs. noir), the answer might range from an optimistic "yes" to a cautionary "yes, but..." or a stark "no."

5. **Deeper Themes:** Some narratives lead characters (and audiences) into deeper self-examination. Instead of simply addressing external goals, they push characters to ask more profound questions about identity, desire, and worthiness.

In essence, this passage analyzes the storytelling structure and themes present in "Slumdog Millionaire," placing it in a broader context of narrative traditions that prioritize external conflict over internal transformation.

#### Who Am I?
**Summary and Clarification:**

The film "Up in the Air" showcases the journey of a corporate hatchet man, Ryan Bingham, who lives a life of constant travel, avoiding permanent ties. He prides himself on his detachment until he meets Alex Goran, a woman mirroring his lifestyle. They grow close, leading Ryan to reconsider his values. However, he misinterprets Alex's intentions, believing she wants the same commitment he does. Upon realizing this isn't true, Ryan undergoes a profound self-reckoning, questioning who he truly is and what he desires. 

The movie falls into a category of stories that revolve around the theme of self-recognition and identity. Such stories emphasize characters who believe they understand themselves and their worlds but end up facing situations that shatter their illusions. The ending is often abrupt, leaving the protagonist in a state of realization rather than resolution. This theme of the danger of self-deception and the importance of self-awareness dates back to ancient times and has been explored in stories like "Oedipus the King", "Chinatown", "Richard II", and "1984", to name a few.

In most of these narratives, the protagonist's self-discovery often comes at a significant cost. The stories serve as warnings about the risks of self-deception and the heavy price of not truly understanding oneself. In certain stories, this realization may lead to a change in the protagonist's ambitions, as seen in "The Godfather", where Michael Corleone abandons his initial desire to distance himself from his family's criminal roots, eventually embracing and even excelling in their world.

Lastly, comedies often use a similar story form, where the protagonist pursues a foolish desire, only to later realize their mistake. Unlike the tragic or dramatic versions of this theme, comedies generally offer redemption, highlighting that joy and happiness can still be found despite our flaws and misjudgments, as long as we remain humble.
#### What Do I Have to Change About Myself to Get What I Want?
**Summary & Clarification**:

The provided text discusses a type of story narrative that revolves around personal change and self-awareness. It can be summarized as follows:

**1. The Change Narrative**: This is about the protagonist questioning, "What do I have to change about myself to get what I want?". Such narratives revolve around the internal transformations one has to go through to achieve a desired outcome.

**Example**: The story of Claireece "Precious" Jones from the movie "Precious" is an example. Precious's life is fraught with hardships including abuse and illiteracy. However, with the help of her teacher and social worker, she recognizes her worth, her ability to love, and the need to change her life. This is a story of personal redemption and finding love amidst adversity.

**2. Historical Roots**: Such stories can be traced back to tales of saints' conversion, novels of personal redemption like "Moll Flanders" by Daniel Defoe, and later, the romance and self-improvement novels of the 18th and 19th centuries. The rise of psychoanalysis further fueled these narratives, exploring personal limitations and the road to overcoming them.

**3. Other Similar Narratives**: Coming-of-age stories like the film "An Education" also fall under this category, where characters transform and realize their worth and dreams.

**4. Clarification on Transformation**: Not all stories where a character undergoes transformation fall under this category. For instance, in "Michael Clayton," the main character's transformation is more about self-definition rather than personal change.

**5. The Reality of Story Categories**: Not all stories fit neatly into specific categories, and perspectives can shift, making one story resemble another type. These narrative templates are more about emphasis rather than strict categorization. Depending on the theme, stories can be structured differently, focusing on internal or external conflicts.

**Final Note**: When crafting a story, the writer should reflect on the thematic question they wish to pose. Each theme offers a distinct moral perspective, leading to different story structures and resolutions.

### Chapter Nineteen - Ciphers, Stiffs, and Sleepwalkers: Protagonist Problems 
**Summary & Clarification**:

Many writers, when candid, admit that villains and secondary characters are generally easier to write than main characters. This is evident in various literature where protagonists like Gulliver, Candide, Oliver Twist, and Jonathan Harker come across as more subdued than other characters in the story. 

There are various reasons for this phenomenon:
1. **Understanding the Stakes**: A common reason is that the writer may not fully grasp what's at stake for the protagonist. This includes understanding what the character desires, the reasons behind those desires, and what they are willing to sacrifice to achieve their goals.
  
2. **Formulation of the Premise**: A weak or ill-defined premise can lead to an underdeveloped protagonist.

3. **Root Question of the Story**: If the foundational question or core conflict of the story isn't identified clearly, it can affect the depth and relatability of the protagonist.

In short, the protagonist's engagement level with readers or viewers might suffer if the writer hasn't delved deeply into understanding the character's motivations, challenges, and the core theme of the story.
#### When the Protagonist's Struggle Is Fundamentally Internal
**Summary & Clarification**:

In some stories, the protagonist's main struggle is internal, such as battling guilt, cowardice, or addiction. In such cases, the protagonist often lacks a distinct external opponent, which results in both the premise and counterpremise revolving around the same character. To navigate this, writers introduce a 'revenant', a character that helps the protagonist confront their inner conflicts, representing their internal tug-of-war. 

An example is the movie "Midnight Cowboy". The protagonist, Joe Buck, desires intimacy but is deeply mistrustful due to past traumas. He faces a choice between staying closed off (represented by the character Shirley) or opening up to pain and love (embodied in his relationship with his friend, Rizzo). Joe becomes his own adversary, embodying both the premise and the counterpremise. The strength of the story lies in its unsentimental portrayal of Joe's dilemma.

Similar internal struggles are common in love stories, where the protagonist's main conflict is an internal barrier preventing them from opening up to love. The drama in such stories can be staged through characters representing different emotional responses the protagonist has to face, such as fear of rejection or betrayal.

This narrative technique is also seen in recovery stories. For instance, in stories about addiction, the protagonist and their internal opponent are the same. Such narratives are most compelling when the protagonist's internal struggles are embodied through fully fleshed-out characters representing different choices and paths.

However, there's a caution: stories that overly simplify or moralize internal battles can end up feeling banal. For such narratives to resonate, they must provide a detailed understanding of the protagonist's past and motivations. An example of effectively dramatizing internal conflict is Ingmar Bergman’s film "Through a Glass Darkly", where the protagonist battles schizophrenia. 

In essence, while stories focusing on internal conflicts might lack a traditional opponent, the key to engaging storytelling lies in framing the protagonist’s struggle as a question and representing different answers to that question through well-developed characters.

#### When the Protagonist Doesn't Know or Is Confused by What She Wants, or Is Afraid to Want It
**Summary & Clarification**:

Many protagonists start their stories uncertain or fearful of their true desires. This topic was explored in chapter 5. To address this issue in storytelling, writers should:

1. **Anchor the Character's Desires in Something Concrete**: This means grounding their varied desires (both genuine and mistaken) in tangible things or people. This makes the protagonist's journey more relatable and understandable for the audience.
 
2. **Introduce a Misguided Objective**: Give the protagonist an objective that seems right to them initially but is ultimately not what they truly want. This misguided goal often arises from self-deception, denial, or resistance to their genuine desire. 

3. **Use Failures as Clues**: The protagonist's repeated failures in achieving true happiness can gradually hint at their mistake, nudging them closer to understanding their genuine desire.

4. **Choose the Misguided Objective Carefully**: This false desire shouldn't be random; it should mirror what the protagonist is holding onto to avoid facing their true desire. Through this, the audience can learn about the protagonist's fears and motivations.

For example, Precious Jones initially doesn't recognize her deep longing for love and instead tries to appease her abusive mother. However, as she meets people who genuinely care for her, the futility of her initial goal becomes evident, guiding her closer to understanding her true desire.
#### When the Protagonist Faces a Problem, an Enigma, or a Disaster Instead of an Opponent
**Summary & Clarification**:

In some stories, the protagonist isn't pitted against an opponent but instead faces a complex situation, puzzle, or catastrophe. This scenario centers on deep, fundamental challenges that can be existential or moral in nature.

**Examples**:

1. In "Rachel, Rachel," the main character grapples with a dreary existence while caring for a demanding mother. She longs for meaningful connections.
2. In Kafka's "The Metamorphosis," Gregor Samsa's transformation into a cockroach brings forth the challenge of reconciling his new identity with society.
3. "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy involves a father and son navigating a post-apocalyptic world, questioning their humanity and morality along the way.
4. "28 Days Later" revolves around the survival aftermath of a virus outbreak, where characters face not only the infected but also the grim reality of how society reacts to such crises.

**Key Points**:

1. **Question at the Heart**: These stories are driven by an essential question that permeates the narrative. For instance, "Can I find love?" in "Rachel, Rachel," or "How do I remain human amid devastation?" in "The Road."

2. **Situational Opponents**: While there isn't a central opponent, protagonists often confront situational adversaries—specific challenges or characters that hinder their progress.

3. **Maintaining Focus**: To avoid the narrative becoming too episodic or overly contemplative, writers often give the protagonist a defined external goal. This helps structure the story while also allowing space to explore deeper themes. For example, in "The Road," the goal is to reach the ocean, providing a clear journey amidst the thematic ponderings on humanity and morality.

4. **Resolving the Fundamental Issue**: In these stories, protagonists seek resolution not merely through achieving specific goals but by addressing the core dilemma. Whether it's Gregor Samsa reconciling his identity or the characters in "28 Days Later" questioning the moral cost of survival, these fundamental issues push the story forward.

In essence, while the specifics of each challenge may vary, such stories tackle deeper questions about identity, morality, and existence, making them profound and thought-provoking for the audience.
#### When the Interconnection Between Outer Goal and Inner Need Is Insufficiently Realized 
**Summary & Clarification**:

Stories often maintain a connection between the protagonist's external goals and their internal needs. The external goal is what the protagonist is outwardly trying to achieve, while the internal need often represents a deeper emotional or personal desire. Ensuring a strong link between these two elements can be crucial for creating a compelling narrative.

1. **Importance of Interconnection**: The protagonist's journey usually involves an outer goal (e.g., saving someone, escaping danger) that mirrors or addresses an inner need or growth they must achieve. Their evolution throughout the story often reflects this dual journey.

2. **Examples**:
   - In *The Secret in Their Eyes*, Benjamin's endeavor to resolve an old murder case intertwines with his unresolved romantic feelings for Irene. His novel's unfinished nature mirrors both the unresolved case and their incomplete romance.
   - In *Bringing Out the Dead*, Frank's numerous emergency calls represent not just his job but his internal struggle with guilt over a patient he couldn't save. The climax of his narrative involves both his acceptance of his limitations as a hero and reconciliation with his haunting past.

3. **Professional Obligation vs. Deeper Meaning**: Some writers, like Lee Child, believe that a character's motivation can be as simple as it being their duty or profession, without needing a profound inner need. However, stories often gain depth when the protagonist's actions in the outer world reflect or address a deeper personal journey or conflict.

4. **Balancing Outer and Inner Journeys**: Crafting a balance between the protagonist's external goals and internal struggles can be the difference between a good story and an unforgettable one. A well-woven connection can enhance the thematic richness and resonance of the narrative.

In essence, while not every story requires a profound inner journey, understanding and harnessing the relationship between external actions and internal growth can significantly elevate a narrative's depth and impact.
#### When the Protagonist Is Conceived as a Vessel of Virtue (or the Myth of the Likable Hero) 
**Summary and Clarification**:

**Topic:** The pitfall of creating an overly virtuous protagonist.

1. **Jesus vs. Peter in the New Testament**: While Jesus is revered as the ultimate hero, his divine calm can sometimes be mistaken for indifference. He's most relatable during his moments of weakness, doubt, or anger. On the other hand, Peter, with his flaws and doubts, feels more relatable and solid. The implication here is that imperfect characters can be more compelling than ones who appear faultless.

2. **The Legacy of Perfect Heroes**: This serene, flawless image of a hero got popularized in chivalric heroes, leading to characters that lacked depth and complexity. Characters like Galahad, despite their noble deeds, are overshadowed by more interesting and flawed secondary characters.

3. **Problem with "Likable" Protagonists**: A frequent mistake in storytelling is to make the protagonist overly virtuous and likable, making them appear passive or reactive. Without any evident flaws, these protagonists lack depth and can seem unrealistic.

4. **Embrace Imperfections**: Characters like Blanche DuBois from "Streetcar Named Desire" or Yossarian from "Catch-22" are memorable because of their flaws. Their imperfections make them more relatable and human.

5. **Misconception about Likability**: There's a common belief that protagonists should be likable. However, it's more important for readers or viewers to empathize with a character than to like them. Protagonists can have negative traits, but if they face compelling problems and have a depth of character, audiences will still connect with them.

6. **Empathy through Vulnerability**: Even if a character has morally questionable traits, showing moments of reflection, doubt, or humor can help audiences empathize with them. These elements indicate a character's vulnerability, making them more relatable.

7. **Examples of Complex Characters**: Characters like Tony Soprano or Humbert Humbert are problematic, but their desires, wit, and complex emotions make them compelling to audiences. It's their unfulfilled desires and depth that draws readers or viewers in.

In essence, creating a protagonist who's a "vessel of virtue" can be a narrative pitfall. Depth, complexity, and genuine human flaws can often create a more compelling and relatable character.
#### When the Protagonist is a Thinly Veiled Stand-in for the Author
**Summary and Clarification:**

**1. When the Protagonist Is a Thinly Veiled Stand-in for the Author:**
- Many authors use themselves as inspiration for their characters. A famous example is Franz Kafka, even if he denied it.
- When the author fails to distance themselves emotionally from this character, they might be unintentionally protective, avoiding giving the character the necessary challenges or flaws to be compelling in a story.
- If authors view their protagonist too kindly (because the character represents them), they might prevent the character from facing essential conflicts, leading to a weak narrative.
- The advice is: if you can't be objective about a character representing you, choose another character to focus on.

**2. Choosing the Wrong Character as the Protagonist:**
- The protagonist should be the character with the most at stake in the story. The audience should be able to empathize with them.
- Using the movie "Blade Runner" as an example:
  - Rick Deckard, the designated protagonist, is tasked with killing replicants.
  - However, Roy, a replicant, is portrayed more empathetically as he is trying to extend his own life span. This quest for life resonates more deeply with audiences.
  - The movie ends up dividing audience sympathies between Deckard and Roy. Deckard's reluctance to fulfill his task and Roy's human-like desire to live confuse the narrative and make the ending seem uncertain and ironically ambivalent.

#### Multiple Protagonists
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Multiple Protagonists in Storytelling:**

1. **Issue**: When there are intersecting or parallel storylines with multiple protagonists, it can blur the focus and divide the audience's sympathies. 
   
    - This issue often arises from inexperienced writing, not knowing where the story's moral and dramatic focus should be, or including scenes that exclude a main character. 
    - The solution to the latter problem might be reimagining who needs to be in the scene. 
    - The former problem, lack of clear focus, is more challenging.

2. **Importance of Climax**: For the climax to be impactful, the audience needs to have a clear empathic connection with the main character present in that scene. If the audience is forced to divide their attention or sympathies during this critical moment, it diminishes the overall impact.

3. **Handling Multiple Main Characters**: 
   
    - One way is to slightly prioritize one character as the main driver of the dramatic action, making the others slightly secondary in importance. 
      - *Example*: In "Dog Soldiers" by Robert Stone, although the plot involves multiple key characters, the action is mainly driven by Ray Hicks. His death provides the climax, while other characters play a supportive role.
    
    - Another approach is to have independent parallel stories, each with its own arc.
      - *Example*: Quentin Tarantino’s "Pulp Fiction" uses this method. However, to provide a climactic sense of conclusion for the entire film, the storylines merge toward the end, centering around the character of Jules Winnfield, who serves as a sort of conscience for the movie.

4. **Conclusion**: Handling multiple protagonists requires careful narrative planning to ensure the story remains compelling and delivers the desired emotional impact at its climax.
#### When the Narrator and Protagonist Differ, but Both Are Characters in the Story
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Narrator vs. Protagonist: The Challenge of Divided Focus**

1. **Potential Problem**: When both the narrator and the protagonist are characters within a story, there is a risk of diluting the narrative focus.

2. **Deceptive Protagonists**: In the example of characters like Captain Ahab from "Moby-Dick" and Jay Gatsby from "The Great Gatsby", both protagonists have deceptive or self-deluding natures. Allowing such characters to narrate their own stories could result in a distorted perspective. Additionally, the fact that both characters die makes them unfit to narrate the entirety of their tales.

3. **Solution**: Both stories use narrators distinct from the protagonists. 
   
    - **Ishmael** in "Moby-Dick": His narrative role is primarily observational, underlined by his status as an outsider. The name "Ishmael" signifies an outlander, further solidifying his role as a somewhat detached observer. Even though he's part of the ship's crew, his newcomer status keeps his perspective fresh, attentive, and curious about the happenings on the ship.
    
    - **Nick Carraway** in "The Great Gatsby": Nick, coming from the Midwest, observes the opulent and tumultuous life at Gatsby’s mansion with reserved judgment. This outsider viewpoint, characterized by his Midwestern sensibilities, ensures he doesn't overshadow Gatsby's story.

4. **Conclusion**: To avoid competing focal points in a narrative, when using a separate narrator and protagonist, it's beneficial to limit the narrator's role, ensuring they remain a relatively minor player next to the main character.
### Chapter Twenty The Character of Conflict: The Opponent
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Character of Conflict: Understanding the Opponent**

1. **Role of the Opponent**: The opponent in a story holds the power to challenge the protagonist by opposing their desires and goals. Their counter-motives or goals test the protagonist's fortitude, forcing them to surpass their limits, or make transformative decisions.

2. **Importance of a Strong Opponent**: The protagonist's journey is made more significant by the strength of their opponent. If the opponent is weak or superficially evil, the protagonist's triumph is undermined. 

3. **Empathizing with the Opponent**: While traditionally, opponents or antagonists are viewed negatively, the best dramas show the conflict as 'good versus good'. This means, from a certain perspective, the actions and beliefs of the opponent are justifiable. Understanding and empathizing with the opponent's viewpoint deepens the narrative and makes the conflict more engaging.

4. **Moving Beyond Simplistic Evil**: While traditional "evil" characters like monsters, serial killers, or brutal parents can be compelling, stories with clear-cut good and evil can be predictable. It's crucial for writers to immerse themselves in their opponent's world, understanding why they see their actions as justified.

5. **Examples**:
   
   - **Achilles vs. Hector**: This is one of literature's greatest battles. Neither side is purely good or evil, and both are admirable for their bravery. Their fight highlights that war recognizes both valor and viciousness.
   
   - **Clockers by Richard Price**: The book presents both a drug dealer and a detective on equal moral grounds, making the reader resonate with both characters' worlds.
   
   - **One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest**: Nurse Ratched isn’t simply mean; she genuinely believes in the need for order for the well-being of her patients, contrasting with McMurphy’s chaotic freedom.

6. **The Moral Significance of Regret**: A powerful narrative can end with the protagonist defeating an opponent we have come to sympathize with, reminding us of the human cost of battles.

In essence, a story becomes richer and more compelling when the opponent is given depth, justification, and understanding. Instead of a simple good vs. evil narrative, stories that explore the complexities of their characters provide a more resonant experience for the audience.
#### When the Opponent Is Genuinely Evil 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Understanding Genuine Evil in Opponents**

1. **Existence of Genuine Evil**: In some narratives, the opponent embodies unquestionable evil, evident in actions driven by greed, lust for power, or sheer cruelty.

2. **Humanizing Evil**: Despite representing evil, these opponents have human elements, like having a family or experiencing simple pleasures like a warm bed or the smell of fresh grass. They might even justify their actions based on their personal circumstances or beliefs. The most daunting aspect of evil is its familiarity and resemblance to human nature.

3. **Depth of Character**: Instead of portraying opponents as merely wicked, writers should explore their redeeming qualities. By understanding their backgrounds, motivations, and choices, they become more realistic and dramatically effective. For instance, characters in literature who commit seemingly inexplicable acts of violence can be better understood when their backgrounds are revealed.

4. **Understanding Opponent’s Motivations**: 
   
   - **Noah Cross in Chinatown**: Although he symbolizes corruption, he perceives himself as a pillar for the future.
   
   - **Richard of Gloucester in Richard III**: He sees his cruelty as a sign of nobility and enlightenment.
   
   - **Philosopher Simone Weil's "affliction"**: This concept discusses the deep pain, both physical and social, that characters might endure, leading them to act in certain ways. Captain Ahab from Moby Dick is a prime example, where he's driven by a deep-seated affliction.

5. **Contrast between Protagonist and Opponent**: To maintain dramatic interest, the protagonist and opponent should have contrasting beliefs and lifestyles, even if both their actions are justifiable. For instance, in Michael Clayton, both the main characters are lawyers but have distinct personal and professional styles.

6. **Embracing the Opponent's Love**: The opponent's affection or love towards something adds depth to the character, making them more compelling. This love introduces both a contradiction in their character and a vulnerability.

7. **Conviction in Opponents**: The genuine conviction in the opponent's beliefs or actions, even if they are evil, makes their character more haunting and memorable. For example, Noah Cross genuinely believes he's acting in his daughter's best interests, showcasing that his evil isn't borne out of pure malice but conviction.

In summary, while opponents might represent genuine evil, delving deep into their human side, understanding their motivations, and showcasing their love and convictions make them more intricate and compelling characters in a narrative.
#### When the Opponent Is Offstage for Long Periods of Time- Clues and Underlings
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Presence of the Opponent in Stories When They Are Absent for Extended Periods**

1. **Mysteries and Enigmas**: In some narratives, the opponent might not be immediately identifiable. For instance, in mystery stories, the protagonist's initial task is to determine who the real antagonist is through hints, clues, or foreshadowing.

2. **Effects and Barriers**: When the main opponent is absent, their influence can still be felt through the obstacles they set up or the after-effects of their actions. Their resistance against the protagonist might be indirect, through secondary characters or barriers.

3. **Nature of the Clues**: The clues left behind in mysteries can provide insights into the nature of the opponent. The manner of violence, the type of evidence, and the choice of weapon can all hint at the opponent's character, background, or intention.

4. **Subordinates or Surrogates**: When the main opponent isn't directly involved, their subordinates or surrogates can serve as a reflection or contradiction of their character. They can either reinforce the opponent’s characteristics or offer a contrast. 

   - Example from *Chinatown*: Two characters, Mulvihill and Midget, represent contrasting sides of Noah Cross, the primary antagonist. While one aligns with Cross's simpler side, the other reflects his finer tastes.
   
   - Example from *Michael Clayton*: The underlings in the story are so similar that it creates an eerie feeling of conformity. Their shared background as ex-military individuals further enhances their unique but parallel identities. Their contrast with Karen Crowder, who employs them, hints at the different worlds they inhabit and their specific roles in the narrative.

5. **Employing Subordinates Strategically**: The use of subordinates can add layers to the story, enhancing suspense, and highlighting different aspects of the main opponent. Their roles and characteristics can either mirror the main opponent or stand in stark contrast, creating dynamic tension and intrigue.

In essence, even when the primary opponent is offstage for extended periods, their presence can be felt and represented through clues, effects, barriers, and subordinates, adding depth and variety to the narrative.
#### Can the Opponent Change?
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Potential for Change in an Opponent's Character**

1. **Common Misconception**: There's a prevalent notion that opponents, particularly villains, don't undergo character development or change. Often, they are depicted as individuals with personality disorders, making them resistant to change.

2. **Reality of Character Dynamics**: Opponents can and do change, especially in dramas where both sides of the conflict have significant motivations. When both sides have good intentions, this allows for richer character development.

3. **Caution**: Giving an opponent the capacity to change can sometimes shift the audience's attention from the protagonist. While this can be a concern, it isn't an absolute rule. It's essential to handle such developments with care so as not to overshadow the main character.

4. **Example from "3:10 to Yuma"**: In this western drama, the opponent, Ben Wade, experiences character growth. While he remains an outlaw, his feelings and perception of Dan Evans, another central character, evolve throughout the narrative. This change in Wade's character isn't just emotional; it significantly influences the story's ending.

In essence, opponents in narratives can change, and this transformation can add depth and richness to the story. While it's essential to manage this change without overshadowing the protagonist, doing so can elevate the narrative's complexity and engagement.

### Chapter Twenty-one - The Army of Others: Secondary Characters

#### How Secondary is a Secondary Character?
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Role and Depth of Secondary Characters in Fiction**

1. **Round vs. Flat Characters**: E. M. Forster, in "Aspects of the Novel", introduced the concept of "round" (fully developed) versus "flat" characters, with a preference for round characters.

2. **Transparent vs. Opaque Characters**: James Wood, in his critique "How Fiction Works", prefers the terms "transparent" (easily understood at first glance) and "opaque" (characters with hidden depths). He argues that transparent characters, often found in Dickens's works, serve important purposes in fiction.

3. **Secondary Characters' Role**: These characters serve to highlight and emphasize the main character's traits, emotions, and motivations. They can display the main character's different facets, making them more three-dimensional.

4. **Complexity in Secondary Characters**: While they have a set function in the story, secondary characters should be crafted uniquely to avoid being cliché. This requires giving them distinct personalities, emotions, and potential for development. However, writers need to ensure these characters don't overshadow the protagonist.

5. **Evolving Roles**: Secondary characters' roles can evolve. For example, an ally can turn into a traitor. These changes offer opportunities for character development and unexpected plot twists, which can engage the reader more deeply.

6. **Meeting Audience Expectations**: Secondary characters have been a part of dramatic traditions for a long time. However, they shouldn't just be formulaic. Writers should aim to present them uniquely, subverting or meeting reader expectations as required for the narrative's benefit.

7. **Final Note**: Secondary characters, though they serve a secondary purpose, should not be half-baked. They can remain transparent as long as they're intriguing. The subsequent part of the text likely delves into an in-depth analysis of various roles secondary characters can take on in a narrative.

In essence, secondary characters, while supporting the main characters, should be developed with care and thought to enhance the story's depth and richness. They can both fulfill traditional roles and break the mold to add layers of complexity to the narrative.
#### The Ghost
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Ghost Character in Literature**

1. **Introduction to the Ghost**: In literature, the term "ghost" refers not just to supernatural beings but more broadly to elements or characters from the past that pose moral, emotional, or psychological dilemmas for the protagonist.

2. **Embodiment of Backstory**: It's effective to encapsulate a protagonist's emotional or moral backstory in specific "ghost" characters. These characters signify unresolved issues or baggage the protagonist brings into the present narrative.

3. **Literal and Metaphorical Ghosts**:
   - *Literal Ghosts*: In "Bringing Out the Dead," Rose is a spectral figure representing the main character Frank's moral crisis over life and death decisions.
   - In "Death of a Salesman," Willy Loman is haunted by visions of his deceased brother Ben, symbolizing Willy's perception of his own failures.
   
4. **Multiple Ghosts**: A protagonist can be haunted by several "ghosts," as in the case of Joe Buck. Various figures from his past, both living and dead, represent his history of abandonment, false affection, and abuse.

5. **Living Ghosts**: Ghost characters can be both alive and actively participating in the story. They often represent lingering burdens from the past. For instance:
   - In "Rachel, Rachel," the mother signifies societal expectations and duty that restrict her daughter's life.
   - In other stories like "Ordinary People," "I Never Sang for My Father," and "The Glass Menagerie," family members serve as the "ghosts," each showcasing unique aspects of familial burdens and expectations.

6. **Complexity**: The depth and complexity of the "ghost" character are proportional to the intricacy of the protagonist's issues with the past. The more intricate the history, the richer the characterization of the ghost should be.

In essence, the "ghost" in literature serves as a powerful tool to highlight and delve into the protagonist's unresolved issues, past traumas, or emotional burdens. It can be a literal spirit, a memory, or a living person who symbolizes the protagonist's internal struggles.

#### The Revenant
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Revenant Character in Literature**

1. **Definition**: The revenant is a secondary character who, intentionally or not, pushes the protagonist to confront issues connected to their "ghost." This character can play multiple roles, from love interests to mentors or even rivals.

2. **Role Contrast**: The revenant is pivotal in illustrating the difference between a protagonist's external conflicts (their outward objectives) and their internal growth or transformation. 

3. **Examples**:
   - In *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*, Jim is Huck's revenant. His presence and actions help Huck redefine freedom and humanity. Jim's virtues contrast sharply with the dishonesty shown by Huck’s father, making Jim a reflective figure in the story.
   - In *Silas Marner* by George Eliot, the young Eppie rejuvenates the jaded Silas Marner, revealing that one can always choose happiness.
   - *Chinatown* features Evelyn Mulwray as a dual revenant—she helps Jake uncover the mystery and simultaneously aids him in confronting his inner cynicism. The climax brings together the protagonist, the revenant, and the antagonist, addressing both external and internal conflicts.
   - In *Michael Clayton*, Arthur Edens is the catalyst for the external plot problem and also sparks Michael's inner moral turmoil. The climax, even in Arthur’s absence, integrates both these conflicts.
   - In *City of Thieves*, Lev confronts fears about death and his insecurity about virginity. Kolya assists him in facing these concerns, while Vika, as an ally, equips him with survival skills and serves as a love interest. Both characters emphasize the war's importance: safeguarding loved ones.

4. **Distinctive Feature**: What sets the revenant apart from other secondary characters is its profound and lasting impact on the protagonist. While external events might shape a protagonist's growth, true transformation, especially overcoming inherent flaws, often needs another character's influence.

5. **Essence**: In both fiction and reality, our understanding of ourselves often requires reflection or interaction with others. The revenant serves this purpose, challenging the protagonist and catalyzing their transformation.

In a nutshell, the revenant is an essential literary tool used to emphasize and facilitate the protagonist's internal journey, often contrasting with or complementing their external quest.
#### The Counterweight Character
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Counterweight Character in Literature**

1. **Definition**: The counterweight character works to preserve the status quo or pull the protagonist back into a prior state, often opposing the transformative influence of the revenant character. These characters can stem from the protagonist's past or represent longstanding issues they're trying to escape.

2. **Role**: These characters essentially anchor or pull back the protagonist, acting as obstacles to their forward progression. This could be in the form of old friends, past lovers, family, or anyone who embodies the protagonist's past or existing struggles.

3. **Examples**:
   - In *Prince of Thieves* (adapted into the film *The Town*), Doug McCray is influenced by his old gang, ex-girlfriend, and imprisoned father, all discouraging his desires for a better life. This life away from crime is symbolized by Claire, a bank teller he gets involved with.
   - *Breaking Bad* features Jesse Pinkman’s circle of acquaintances that continually pull him back into a cycle of drug abuse and self-destructive behavior.
   - The film *Les Enfants du Paradis* sees the mime JeanBaptiste caught between his enduring love Nathalie, representing tradition, and the actress Garance, symbolizing his aspirations.
   - In *The Age of Innocence* by Edith Wharton, Newland Archer experiences an internal tug-of-war between his conventional wife, May (embodying societal norms), and the free-spirited countess Ellen Olenska (signifying a different, more adventurous path). Notably, both women rise above their roles: May offers Newland freedom and acknowledges his sacrifices, while the countess refrains from courting Newland out of respect for May.

4. **Nuance**: It's essential to note that counterweight characters aren't always negative; they might simply epitomize tradition, familiarity, or a past the protagonist is familiar with, contrasting with the revenant's push for change.

In essence, the counterweight character serves to challenge the protagonist by representing what they might be leaving behind or the difficulties in seeking change. They add depth to the narrative by providing internal conflicts for the main character, adding layers to their transformation journey.
#### The Crucial Ally
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Crucial Ally in Narrative**

1. **Definition and Role**: The crucial ally is a supporting character who aids the protagonist by offering a range of resources: guidance, skills, companionship, moral support, and sometimes, a contrasting perspective. The ally can sometimes assume the role of the revenant, promoting change in the protagonist.

2. **Variety**: Crucial allies can be mentors, love interests, sidekicks, experts, siblings, or servants. They often differ from the protagonist in certain aspects, such as age, gender, class, or ethnicity, emphasizing the gap between the protagonist's current state and what they need to learn or experience.

3. **Placement in Plot**: While some writing guides suggest the crucial ally often appears at the end of Act One and might be removed by Act Three to allow the hero to stand alone, this isn’t a hard and fast rule. When the ally does face adversity or death, it often serves as a poignant moment in the story, especially if the ally's end is marked by self-sacrifice or courage.

4. **Examples**:
   - In *Oliver Twist*, the Artful Dodger teaches Oliver street skills and helps mold his character.
   - In *Romeo and Juliet*, Mercutio's friendship and eventual death spur Romeo to actions he might not otherwise have taken.
   - In *The Thin Man*, Nora doesn't have special skills but motivates Nick to solve mysteries.
   - In crime novels, protagonists might rely on allies who carry out the darker deeds, allowing the hero to maintain moral integrity. E.g., Spenser has Hawk in Robert B. Parker's series, and Easy Rawlins has Mouse in Walter Mosley's stories.

5. **Villain’s Allies**: Antagonists also have crucial allies, often more colorful or extreme in their actions and attitudes. These characters can humanize the villain or highlight the villain's severity. They serve various roles, from enforcers to advisors.

6. **Multiple Allies**: Main characters can have multiple allies, like Frodo in *Lord of the Rings* or Avon Barksdale's team in *The Wire*. Each ally brings a unique skill or perspective, enriching the protagonist's journey.

7. **Making Allies Real**: It's essential to develop crucial allies as fully fleshed-out characters, not merely plot devices. They should have their own motivations, flaws, and arcs, making them genuine and relatable.

In essence, the crucial ally enriches the narrative by providing support, contrast, and depth to the main character's journey. Whether serving as a moral compass, skill teacher, or emotional anchor, the ally is instrumental in shaping the protagonist's path.
#### The Betrayer and the Sympathetic Heavy
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Betrayer and the Sympathetic Heavy in Storytelling**

1. **The Betrayer**:
   - **Role**: The act of betrayal is a powerful narrative tool, often causing significant emotional impact. A character committing betrayal can become central to a story.
   - **Dramatizing Betrayal**: For a betrayal to be impactful, trust must first be established between the characters. Additionally, the reason for the betrayal must be motivated, ensuring the act doesn’t appear predictable.
   - **Example**: In *Sense and Sensibility*, John Willoughby deceives Marianne and the Dashwood family after showing genuine affection and trust. His sudden desertion, driven by his fear of poverty, is deeply hurtful and unexpected. When confronted, he takes the typical route of deflecting responsibility.

2. **Sympathetic Heavy**:
   - **Definition**: Originating from crime fiction, a "sympathetic heavy" is a character that is allied with the antagonist but ends up assisting or feeling compassion for the protagonist.
   - **Role**: This character often provides valuable insights or information to the hero, functioning somewhat like a "crucial ally". However, they generally face consequences for their double allegiance, often meeting their end by the climax of the story.
   - **Character Traits**: These characters exist in a morally gray area, making them intriguing. Their internal conflict and the potential hope they offer the protagonist add depth to the narrative.
   - **Examples**: In *Bellman & True*, Salto is a criminal who protects Hiller, a less-experienced accomplice, and his son. In other scenarios, it might be a prison guard offering extra supplies to captives, or an assistant district attorney having feelings for the defendant. This character's position creates dramatic tension due to the risk of them being perceived as traitors.

In essence, the figures of the betrayer and the sympathetic heavy serve to add layers of complexity, emotion, and tension to a story. While the betrayer offers a shocking twist and an exploration of trust and deceit, the sympathetic heavy provides moral ambiguity and offers moments of hope and suspense in the narrative.
#### The Visitor and the Stranger
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Visitor and the Stranger in Storytelling**

1. **Role**: Both the Visitor and the Stranger serve as characters who offer an external perspective on the events of a story, distinct from the ingrained cultural and social viewpoints of the primary setting. They do not narrate the story like Ishmael or Nick Carraway but instead influence the narrative and the protagonist through their unique viewpoints.

2. **Character Impact**: Their presence often challenges the protagonist's understanding of their environment, sometimes granting a renewed perspective or awakening curiosity.

3. **Examples**:
   - *To Kill a Mockingbird*: Dill Harris, a summer visitor to Maycomb County, offers Scout a fresh way to view her everyday life. Dill's vivid imagination, especially concerning the reclusive Boo Radley, stirs the curiosity of Scout and Jem. This leads them to investigate Boo's mysterious existence, inadvertently drawing him out of his seclusion and creating a significant bond with Scout.
   - *Rachel, Rachel*: The film showcases the transformative impact of two strangers on Rachel Cameron, a spinster. The passionate services of an itinerant preacher and the unexpected return of Nick Kazlik, a childhood friend now living in the city, deeply affect Rachel. Both characters introduce upheaval and excitement to her otherwise routine life.

In essence, the characters of the Visitor and the Stranger serve as catalysts in a story, prompting introspection, change, or action by introducing external perspectives and influences. They allow protagonists and audiences to see familiar settings and situations through a new lens, often leading to pivotal moments in the narrative.
#### The Village
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Concept of "The Village" in Storytelling:**

1. **Definition**: "The Village" symbolizes the social, familial, and communal ties surrounding the protagonist and opponent. It represents the various groups of people and relationships that are integral to the characters' daily lives, morals, and desires.

2. **Role**:
   - It brings the protagonists' and opponents' objectives to life by showcasing how they impact real people. 
   - The characters from "The Village" mirror the complex web of obligations, expectations, and affiliations of the main characters, enhancing the narrative's depth and texture.

3. **Examples**: 
   - In "It’s a Wonderful Life," the citizens of Bedford Falls create a vivid tapestry around the protagonist.
   - In "Tony Soprano," the characters surrounding Tony—from his family members to his associates—highlight his multifaceted nature. For instance, his children, Meadow and Anthony, offer contrasting glimpses into Tony's pride, vulnerabilities, expectations, and parental relationships.

4. **Importance**:
   - These secondary characters aren't mere fillers. They are essential in portraying the broader world in which the main characters operate. They can heighten emotions, reveal character motivations, and emphasize stakes.
   - They offer contrast, allowing for a deeper exploration of the main characters' struggles and emotions.

5. **Differentiation**: Unlike the outsider perspective provided by a visitor or stranger, "The Village" is made up of insiders familiar with the protagonists' daily life. They contribute to the story's richness, reflecting the ongoing hustle and negotiations that define everyday life.

6. **Application in Writing**: Authors should carefully select members of "The Village" based on their main characters' psychological and sociological traits. These choices can amplify relevant story elements and deepen the narrative's impact.

In essence, "The Village" consists of characters that provide an inside look into the protagonists' world, adding layers to the story and assisting readers in better understanding the stakes, struggles, and relationships central to the narrative.



## Part IIII - Technique

### Chapter Twenty-two - The Clash of Character: Scenes

#### The Centrality of Scene
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Significance of Scenes in Storytelling:**

1. **Definition**: Scenes are the backbone of storytelling, where characters interact with each other, bringing out their emotional intricacies and conflicts.

2. **Purpose**: 
   - Scenes make internal emotions, values, and ideas tangible by forcing characters to act on them.
   - They offer an avenue to externalize the internal conflicts and dilemmas, making them more relatable and impactful.

3. **Why Scenes are Central**:
   - While inner thoughts and monologues can provide insight, scenes with direct character interaction are more compelling as they showcase overt conflict and raw emotion.
   - Scenes create definitive moments: Decisions made and actions taken during them solidify character arcs, reveal their identities, and are irreversible.

4. **Common Mistake**: New writers often avoid delving deep into scenes due to apprehensions about confronting and portraying intense emotions, opting for tidier narratives. However, the authenticity and complexity that arise from conflicts within scenes offer richer storytelling.

5. **Example**: 
   - In "The Price" by Arthur Miller, the central conflict isn't explored through introspective monologues. Instead, it's showcased through confrontational scenes between brothers Walter and Victor Franz. Their face-to-face interactions unravel their individual regrets, sacrifices, and insecurities, making it more engaging than mere self-reflection.
   - The scenes help audience members understand the deeper message of the play, illustrating the emotional costs of decisions and moral dilemmas.

6. **Essence**: Scenes not only externalize and dramatize internal struggles but also solidify a character's place in the narrative world, as actions taken are permanent, anchoring characters into their realities.

In essence, scenes, through their portrayal of conflict and confrontation, offer a more vivid and resonant exploration of character emotions and dilemmas, cementing characters' positions and decisions in the storyline.

#### The Mechanics of Scene
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Mechanics of Scene Structure in Storytelling:**

1. **Structural Elements**:
   - **Setup**: Establishes the situation and conflict among characters.
   - **Turning Point**: An unexpected event that instigates significant change.
   - **Payoff**: The climax of the scene, which often paves the way for the next scene.

2. **Character-driven Elements**:
   - **Objective**: What the character desires.
   - **Obstacle**: Challenges faced by the character in achieving the objective.
   - **Action**: Strategies employed by the character to surmount the obstacle.

3. **Scenes vs. Sequels**:
   - Scenes depict conflict through dramatic action.
   - Sequels offer characters (and the audience) a pause for emotional processing, reflection, and decision-making regarding future actions.

4. **Illustrative Example**:
   - In a hypothetical story, a reporter encounters a captivating woman at a party. The woman's elderly, unwell husband is a renowned artist. The reporter wants to connect with her, faces the obstacle of her being married, and takes specific actions to get closer.

5. **Importance of Emotion and Thought**:
   - While a scene progresses, the underlying thoughts and emotions of characters can either be overtly described or subtly hinted through dialogues and actions.
   - Balance is key: Allow enough introspection to indicate the character’s mindset but avoid hampering the flow.
   - Surface-level actions and dialogues can convey profound thoughts and emotions. The audience can interpret much from the exterior, often filling in the gaps, which enhances their connection to the story.

6. **Prose and Poetry**: Prose can be poetic when focused on the surface—through the rhythm of words and sounds. Emotional depth can emerge without diving deep into the character’s psyche.

7. **Transition and Pacing**: After intense scenes, a "breather" is often needed. This is where characters reflect and decide their next moves, but it's crucial to keep such sections concise to maintain momentum.

8. **Common Mistake**: New writers might over-explain feelings or thoughts, which can be redundant if those emotions or plans are already shown or will be portrayed in upcoming scenes.

In essence, effective scene construction in storytelling balances external actions with internal reflections, driving the narrative forward while allowing for emotional depth and character development.
#### Balancing Action and Inner Life
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Balancing External Action and Internal Reflection in Storytelling:**

1. **Balancing Action and Inner Life:** In storytelling, there's a constant need to strike a balance between the external events (action) and the internal experiences (thoughts and feelings) of characters.

2. **Nature of Literary Fiction:** It often leans more towards the descriptive, capturing profound insights and painting vivid, poetic scenes. While this is beautiful, it can sometimes lack the life and energy of raw action.

3. **Service of Action:** Inner thoughts and emotions should serve the action, providing a foundation for characters to respond, reflect, and make decisions. This dynamic keeps the narrative moving and engaging.

4. **Examples:** 
   - In **Kate Atkinson’s "When Will There Be Good News?"**, a little girl named Joanna processes the loss of her family. While her reflections may seem trivial at first, they reveal her attempt to find her place just before a tragedy.
   - In **Richard Price’s "Clockers"**, Detective Rocco Klein showcases the dichotomy of wanting to be a good father while battling his inner cynicism and past memories.
   - In **Richard Ford’s "The Lay of the Land"**, Frank Bascombe’s choice of clothing as he meets his ex-wife reveals his inner turmoil and fears of judgment.
   
5. **Tension Between Inner and Outer:** Inner reflections can contrast with outer actions, creating a form of drama and conflict.

6. **Contradictions for Drama:** A powerful tool in storytelling is when a character's internal thoughts are at odds with their external actions. For instance, in **Patricia Highsmith’s "The Talented Mr. Ripley"**, Tom Ripley's inner monologues of deceit contrast sharply with his external behaviors, creating a captivating tension.

In essence, while raw action drives a story forward, it's the interplay between characters' external actions and internal reflections that gives depth, tension, and relatability to the narrative. The best stories often artfully dance between these two elements, making readers or viewers deeply invested in the unfolding tale.
### Chapter Twenty-three - The Personal Perspective: Point of View
#### Choosing the Point of View: Three Key Questions
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Choosing the Point of View in Storytelling: The Importance and Three Key Questions**

**Introduction:**
* Point of view (POV) is critical in storytelling. Establishing a consistent and clear POV provides readers with a solid ground, helping them trust the author and the story.
* Changing POV needs a strong rationale so that readers can naturally understand the shift without feeling confused.
* Point of view may come instinctively or after much deliberation.

**Three Central Questions for Choosing POV:**
1. **Why is this story being told?**
   - This question is about the emotional or transformative impact of the story's events on the characters.
   - The character from whose eyes we view the story should have a stake in it. Their viewpoint matters because the events are significant to them, whether they're directly involved or observing from a distance.

2. **Who has the authority to tell the story?**
   - Typically, the characters most affected or having the highest stakes in the story's events are best placed to narrate.
   - Practical advice: Often, the character present in the most scenes, especially dramatic ones, should be the POV character. For example, in *To Kill a Mockingbird*, Scout narrates but key events revolve around Atticus, requiring the author to incorporate Scout in those scenes convincingly.
   - If the narrator is trying to decipher the meaning or significance of the events, they need to be as detailed and complex as any main character. Their reasons for narrating should be clear to avoid weakening the story.

3. **How should the story be told?**
   - Determine the desired tone or effect: Do you want emotional depth, irony, comedy, moral ambiguity, or a thrilling tale?
   - Consider the nature of your story. Is it intimate, requiring a first-person or close third-person POV, or does it cover a vast scope, implying multiple-third-person or an omniscient POV might be best?
   - Reflect on books you've admired and examine their POVs. This reflection can guide your decision or reinforce an instinctive choice.

**In Conclusion:**
Selecting a POV is essential for the effectiveness of storytelling. It provides the lens through which readers experience the story. By answering the questions of why, who, and how, authors can make a more informed and impactful choice about POV, ensuring a deeper connection with their readers.
#### Objective Versus Subjective Mode
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Objective vs. Subjective Mode in Storytelling**

**Definition:**
- **Objective Mode:** Focuses on external events. If internal thoughts or emotions are conveyed, it’s in a detached manner. It describes events as observed, not felt by the character. This mode is powerful when less explanation is given because it often heightens the emotional impact.
- **Subjective Mode:** Provides direct access to a character's internal thoughts and emotions, creating intimacy. It's like "looking over the shoulder" or being "inside the mind" of the character. However, it may risk over-explaining or becoming too analytical.

**Notable Points:**
1. **Masters of Objective Mode:** Writers like Hemingway, Joan Didion, and Pete Dexter use objective mode effectively. This mode is especially impactful for events that are inherently dramatic.
2. **Flexibility:** You can fluidly move between objective and subjective modes, as long as the transitions are managed carefully.
3. **Impact of the Mixed Approach:** Hemingway’s “In Another Country” is an example of seamlessly blending both modes. The story starts in an objective manner, describing interactions and events. Yet, when it delves into the protagonist's feelings of shame, the mode momentarily becomes subjective. This blending heightens the emotional impact of the narrative.
4. **Consistency and Clarity:** Shifting suddenly between these modes, especially without clear reason, can confuse readers. A poorly managed transition might seem like the author intruding into the story. Omniscient narrators can more freely shift perspectives, but this approach can be challenging to execute without alienating readers.

**In Conclusion:**
Choosing between objective and subjective modes is crucial in shaping the narrative's emotional depth and clarity. While both modes offer unique advantages, blending them requires careful attention to maintain the story's coherence and impact.
#### First Person
**Summary and Clarification:**

**First Person Narrative**

**Definition:** 
The first person point of view is when the author assumes the persona of a character within the story, typically the protagonist.

**Advantages:**
1. **Naturalness:** It feels like the authentic voice of the storyteller and is relatable since we often tell stories about ourselves in this way.
   
   *Example:* "I visited Julia yesterday..."
   
2. **Immediacy:** Readers feel present with the narrator and connected to their experiences.
3. **Richness of Voice:** The first person offers unique voices, whether reflective, humorous, pragmatic, or philosophical. This has been showcased by writers like Conrad, Robinson, Greer, Lethem, Shteyngart, Crumley, and Block.
4. **Ease of Expressing Thoughts:** There's no need for phrases like “he thought” or “she wondered.” Readers directly access the narrator's thoughts and feelings.

**Challenges:**
1. **Lack of Temporal Immediacy:** As the narrator often looks back at events, it might feel reflective rather than immediate. This can potentially dilute suspense because the outcome is sometimes evident.
2. **Structural Limitations:** Only scenes including the point-of-view character can be shown. Otherwise, events are recounted second-hand, which can feel less engaging.
3. **Limited External Description:** You can't describe the narrator externally without resorting to methods like having them look in a mirror. However, the absence of physical description can be both a challenge and an advantage:
   - *Challenge:* The narrator’s essence must be captured through their voice.
   - *Advantage:* Readers can easily project themselves onto the character, enhancing their engagement.
4. **Restricted Worldview:** The entire narrative is limited to the narrator’s perspective and knowledge. This can become problematic if the author tries to introduce information beyond the character's awareness, as it disrupts the narrative's authenticity.

**Conclusion:**
While the first-person narrative offers an intimate and relatable storytelling mode, it comes with inherent limitations. The balance lies in harnessing its strengths while navigating its challenges, much like being captivated by a story from a beloved family member.
#### The Special Case of the Unreliable Narrator
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Unreliable Narrator**

**Definition:** 
An unreliable narrator offers a perspective that might not be entirely accurate or trustworthy, highlighting the subjective nature of our perceptions.

**Examples and Reasons for Unreliability:**
1. **Youth:** Scout in "To Kill a Mockingbird" offers a perspective influenced by her young age.
2. **Bias or Emotion:** Charles Kinbote in "Pale Fire" has a feverish grudge, and Julian Barnes's protagonist in "The Sense of an Ending" has repressed emotions.
3. **Distinct Perspective:** Nick Carraway in "The Great Gatsby" misinterprets events due to his sheltered, midwestern background.
4. **Secondhand Reporting:** The English instructor in Conrad’s "Under Western Eyes" provides insights based on Razumov’s diary and acquaintances, not direct experience.
5. **Mental Deficiency:** Chief Bromden in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest" and Hugh Boone in "Theft" offer perspectives influenced by their mental states.
6. **Personal Flaws:** The protagonist in "Catcher in the Rye" and the character in "Fight Club" have personal imperfections that distort their narratives.
7. **Drug Influence:** "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is narrated under the influence of drugs.
8. **Self-justification:** Humbert Humbert in "Lolita" offers a skewed narrative to justify his actions.
   
**Purpose:**
While the unreliable narrator creates ambiguity, it also prompts readers to question narratives and remain skeptical about appearances. Notably, it’s not about distrusting the entire narrative. There’s often a significant amount of truth, enough to keep readers engaged. However, this narrative style also reinforces the character-driven nature of the story.

**Conclusion:**
The use of an unreliable narrator deepens the reader's engagement with the narrative by challenging them to discern truth from subjectivity. This approach is deeply rooted in the character, making it a unique and engaging perspective in storytelling.
#### Other Special Cases: Second Person and First Person Plural
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Other Points of View: Second Person and First Person Plural**

1. **Second Person Point of View:**
   - **Purpose:** The second person viewpoint seeks to either universalize the story by allowing readers to envision themselves in the narrative or depict a protagonist disconnected from themselves.
   - **Effects:** 
     1. **Universalization:** Makes the reader the character: e.g., "You enter the classroom." This can sometimes cause the character to feel somewhat vague.
     2. **Alienation:** The character feels detached from self: e.g., "You enter the waiting room among the elderly patients." This effect can be jarring and should be used intentionally.
   - **Examples:** 
     - *Bright Lights, Big City* by Brett Easton Ellis 
     - *Self-Help* by Lorrie Moore
     - *The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao* features a chapter where Lola narrates in second person to emphasize her transformation upon discovering her mother's illness.
   
2. **First Person Plural (We):**
   - **Purpose:** This viewpoint gives a collective perspective, often used to show conformity or shared experiences within a group.
   - **Effect:** Narration represents shared beliefs and experiences of a group, occasionally zooming in on individual members.
   - **Examples:** 
     - *The Virgin Suicides* by Jeffrey Eugenides: Displays group perspective without judgment.
     - *Our Kind* by Kate Walbert: Narration alternates between individual members and the collective group.
   - **Challenge:** Keeping the narrator distinct while maintaining the group perspective encapsulated in the term "we."

**Conclusion:** 
Second person and first person plural are unique storytelling perspectives that, when used effectively, can provide deep insights into character experiences or shared group dynamics. They are less common but can be powerful tools in the hands of skilled authors.
#### Third Person
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Third Person Point of View:**

1. **Definition**: Third person point of view narrates stories with external pronouns like "he", "she", or "they". Familiar from fairy tales, it’s commonly used in everyday conversations about others.
   
2. **Benefits**:
   - **Versatility**: Used in acclaimed novels like *Madame Bovary*, *Middlemarch*, *The Corrections*, and *The English Patient*.
   - **Descriptive Potential**: Ability to describe characters externally.
   - **Varied Worldview**: Not limited to a single character's perspective, but this flexibility should be exercised judiciously to avoid seeming intrusive.
   - **Suspense**: Withholding key information to create intrigue.
   
3. **Drawbacks**:
   - **Perceived Distance**: There can be a sensed gap between readers and characters, though close third person can mitigate this.
   - **Less Fluid Transitions**: Transitioning between memories and inner thoughts can be jarring. Phrases like "he thought" can disrupt the narrative's flow.
   - **Potential for Intrusions**: Impressions must be tied to a character, or they might seem like unwanted authorial interjections.
   - **Consistency in Perspective**: Generally, it's advised to stick to one character's perspective in a scene to avoid confusion.

4. **Narrative Fluidity**: Transitioning from a close, subjective perspective to a more objective view can be challenging. It's often useful to think of the third-person perspective as a film crew, moving in and out, capturing thoughts and actions. However, abrupt shifts can disrupt the reader's immersion.

5. **Example Analysis**: In the provided passage from *Do They Know I’m Running?*, the narrative starts closely tied to Roque’s perspective. It transitions smoothly from his immediate actions to his reflections on his relationship with Mariko, and then back to the current scene. Successful third person narration intertwines external actions with internal reflections in a seamless manner.

**In Conclusion**:
Third person narration offers flexibility and depth, allowing readers to engage with both the external world of the characters and their innermost thoughts. It's a common choice for both beginner and seasoned writers due to its versatility. However, it requires careful handling of transitions, perspectives, and potential intrusions to ensure a smooth narrative flow.
#### Single Versus Multiple Points of View
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Single vs. Multiple Points of View (POV)**

1. **Single Point of View**:
   - **Advantages**:
     - **Intense Bond**: Offers a close relationship between the reader and the point-of-view character.
     - **Consistency**: Provides a stable narrative, making it easier for the reader to follow.
   - **Limitations**:
     - **Restricted Perspective**: Can only depict events that the POV character witnesses, potentially limiting suspense or foreshadowing opportunities.
     
2. **Multiple Points of View**:
   - **Advantages**:
     - **Varied Scenes**: Allows showcasing scenes beyond the reach of one character, offering diverse perspectives.
     - **Richer Narrative Tools**: Offers opportunities for foreshadowing, suspense, irony, and complexity by contrasting different views on events.
     - **Distinct Voices**: Each character's tone can offer variety and fresh perspectives to the story.
   - **Notable Examples**:
     - **Multiple First Person**: Requires clearly differentiated voices, showcased effectively in works like Peter Carey’s *Theft*, Ursula Le Guin’s *The Left Hand of Darkness*, Jake Arnott’s *The Long Firm*, and Faulkner’s *The Sound and the Fury*.
     - **Multiple Third Person**: A common choice in fiction due to its flexibility and natural flow.
   - **Considerations**:
     - **Limiting Number of Voices**: To avoid confusion, it's usually beneficial to restrict the number of viewpoint characters. A typical recommendation is to have about three main POV characters. However, brief sections from a secondary character can sometimes add an unexpected twist or contrast to the narrative.

**In Conclusion**:
While a single POV offers a deep and focused bond with one character, multiple POVs provide a tapestry of perspectives and narrative tools. Choosing between them depends on the story's requirements and the desired narrative effect. If using multiple POVs, it's crucial to ensure each character's voice is distinct and to judiciously limit the number of main viewpoint characters for clarity.
#### Omniscient 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Omniscient Point of View (POV)**

1. **Definition**: 
   - The omniscient POV is where the narrator knows everything, including the thoughts and feelings of all characters in the story. The viewpoint is not limited to one character's perspective but is all-encompassing.

2. **Comparison with Multiple-Third-Person**: 
   - Multiple-third-person sticks to one character's perspective for a scene, section, or chapter, whereas omniscient constantly maintains a god-like view of all events and characters.

3. **Historical Usage**: 
   - The omniscient POV was a dominant narrative mode in many nineteenth-century novels. It suited vast narratives by authors like Dickens, Tolstoy, and Hardy but was also employed effectively in more compact stories like those of George Eliot and Jane Austen.
   - Modern authors who have used this perspective include Gabriel García Márquez, Salman Rushdie, and Ann Patchett.

4. **Characteristics**:
   - The narrator is an unnamed entity who comprehensively understands the story, including every character's internal experiences.
   - This viewpoint conveys an inherent reliability due to its comprehensive knowledge.

5. **Advantages**:
   - **Broad Scope**: The omniscient narrator can be anywhere and relay any event or feeling, offering a complete overview.
   - **Assumed Reliability**: Due to its all-knowing nature, this POV often carries an inherent trustworthiness.

6. **Limitations**:
   - **Perceived Distance**: Can feel removed from the immediate action, causing a potential lack of intimacy or immediacy in the narrative.
   - **Diluted Empathy**: By accessing numerous minds, it might spread the reader's empathy thin, making it hard to deeply connect with any single character.

7. **Effective Use**: 
   - Not recommended for beginners due to its complexity.
   - Requires a robust narrative voice without becoming just a vague authorial intrusion.
   - The narrator should be like a skilled storyteller, capturing intimacy through a caring and detailed narrative style.

**In Essence**:
The omniscient POV provides a sweeping, god-like view of the story, familiar from many classic novels. While it can offer an encompassing perspective, it requires careful handling to maintain reader engagement and avoid feeling distant or diluted. It's best used by those with a strong command over narrative voice and structure.
#### Point of View in Film and Television 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Point of View in Film and TV**

1. **Camera as an Omniscient Narrator**:
   - In cinema, the director and the camera act similarly to an omniscient narrator in literature. Through varying camera angles, they manipulate perspective, tone, and mood within a scene.

2. **Comparison with Literature**:
   - Scripts share characteristics of both plays and stories with omniscient narrators. Their fluidity allows for shifts in perspective based on the scene's focus. However, just as with literature, there's a limit to how many perspectives can be explored without overwhelming or confusing viewers.

3. **Protagonist-Centric Narratives**:
   - Films, like "Chinatown", often choose to predominantly follow one character, the protagonist. This technique mirrors the singular perspective found in some detective novels and highlights the central hero. Most stories emphasize the hero, suggesting that scripts, in many cases, are best written from a predominantly third-person viewpoint.

4. **First Person through Overnarration**:
   - Voice-overs in film can produce a feeling of intimacy akin to first-person narration in literature. Examples include "Sunset Boulevard" and "Fight Club". Like its literary counterpart, a risk here is "telling" rather than "showing". While a subjective camera (seeing things from a character's viewpoint) can imitate first-person prose, it can feel artificial if overused.

5. **Avoiding Camera Instructions**:
   - Though camera placement influences viewer perspective, it's generally not the writer's role to dictate camera angles. Such decisions typically rest with producers and directors. The story's point of view, in cinematic terms, is primarily determined by the scene's central character or objective, or the focal point of the scene's initial or critical moments.

**In Essence**: 
Films, like literature, utilize point of view to guide the narrative and engage the audience. The camera acts as a flexible tool to shift perspectives, though focusing too much on one can lead to monotony. Voiceovers offer a first-person touch, but with potential pitfalls. While writers craft the story, specific visual decisions like camera angles are typically left to the director.
### Chapter Twenty-four - Language as Attitude: Voice

#### Establishing Authorial Voice
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Establishing Authorial Voice in Writing**

1. **Definition**:
   - Voice in writing refers to a writer's unique style and way of communicating. It integrates style, worldview, attitude, and the writer's unique perspective on the world. Essentially, it's how a writer's personality shines through words.

2. **Importance and Elusiveness**:
   - Voice is vital yet elusive. It's challenging to teach, understand, and even to find in one's own writing.

3. **Exercises to Develop Voice**:
   - **Typing Out Books**: A technique from Floyd Salas where he typed out entire books to internalize their rhythm and style.
   - **Copying Sections**: An exercise recommended by James Frey. Writers copy out sections from their favorite authors daily to gradually internalize and then replicate the style in their own voice.
   - **Memory Recreation**: After reading a piece, try to write it from memory. This helps writers understand their impressions and linguistic tools.

4. **Internalizing Favorite Authors**:
   - Through exercises, writers develop an internal critic or reader, representing the authors they admire. This inner voice helps guide and critique their work.

5. **Write for Others**:
   - Joseph Chaikin emphasized the need to write or perform with a specific audience in mind. Imagining an esteemed figure as your reader can inspire higher quality work.

6. **Imitation Concerns**:
   - Though one might fear that imitating another's work could lead to loss of originality, the chance of perfect imitation is minimal. Oakley Hall's advice was "Steal wisely," implying learning from others but maintaining originality.

7. **Voice in Film and TV**:
   - While voice might be more pronounced in fiction, it still exists in film and TV. Shows and movies have distinct voices based on their creators' unique styles and worldviews. Using similar exercises as with books, scriptwriters can also refine their voices over time.

**In Essence**: 
Authorial voice is the unique flavor and style of a writer's work, representing their perspective and attitude. While elusive, various exercises can help writers hone their voice. Regardless of the medium, be it fiction, film, or TV, the voice is pivotal in differentiating content and making it uniquely resonant with its audience.
#### Voice in the Portrayal of Character
**Summary & Clarification**:

**Voice in Character Portrayal**:
- Voice plays a crucial role in distinguishing characters, much like solos in an orchestral piece. It’s like each character in a story is a unique musical instrument with a particular sound.
- Sam Shepard likened character creation to forming a jazz combo, where every character represents a unique instrument.
- Character voice isn't just about the words spoken; it encompasses style, worldview, and especially attitude.
- There’s a demonstrated contrast in voices among three characters from the book "Do They Know I’m Running?". 
  - **The Rancher**: Depicted as a distant and observant figure, his thoughts and descriptions are straightforward and direct. His language is hard-edged, showing a life lived in the harsh desert.
  - **Roque**: Portrayed as youthful and dreamy, with a romantic tinge to his voice. His character exhibits a blend of softness and rash musicality.
  - **Godo**: He’s bitter, humorous, and resentful. A former warrior, his thoughts and actions showcase his struggle with victimhood and physical scars.
- Consistency in character portrayal is paramount. Writers might go astray by forcing a character to voice a theme or response that doesn’t naturally fit them, turning the character into a mere puppet for the author's message.
- In visual media like film and TV, actions and dialogue become even more significant in defining a character’s voice due to the absence of internal monologue. Thus, precision is key.
- After mastering one’s own authorial voice, crafting the voices for characters will become intuitive. By practicing empathy, an author can immerse themselves in each character, guiding their words and actions.

In essence, to craft a compelling character, writers should ensure the character's voice – encompassing their diction, worldview, and attitude – remains consistent and authentic. This distinct voice aids in conveying depth and personality, allowing readers or viewers to connect deeply with the narrative.
### Chapter Twenty-five - Word as Deed: Dialog 

#### Dialog as Action
**Dialog as Action - Summary and Clarification**

**Summary**:
Dialog is a crucial tool in storytelling; it's not mere chatter but serves as an action in itself. Noted screenwriter, Waldo Salt, would write dialog after laying out the scene's drama and imagery. Playwright Harold Pinter viewed dialog as an expression of silence, highlighting the underlying, unspoken emotions or tensions. Dialog revolves around subtext, the unspoken dynamics and intentions beneath the words. The crux of effective dialog lies in understanding the subtext. The characters, while speaking, jostle for power, try to assert their presence, or conceal truths. They reveal not only their motives but also their background, education, emotional state, and innermost thoughts. Characters can surprise readers by defying their expectations through dialog. For dialog to be impactful, it should stem from the character's deepest desires or needs, not just serve the plot. While revising dialog, its fundamental purpose and the various roles it plays - advancing action, revealing character, providing information - must be considered. Lastly, dialog should sound realistic but not merely replicate everyday speech.

**Clarification**:
- When characters engage in dialog, they're not just talking. They're actively trying to achieve something - whether that's gaining an upper hand, concealing something, or revealing a secret. This underlying motive or intention is the subtext.
  
- Subtext is crucial. Understanding what's really going on beneath the words allows a writer to craft compelling dialog that resonates with readers or viewers.

- Dialog offers insights into a character's background, mindset, and emotions. The way a character speaks can show their upbringing, education, current mood, and many other aspects of their persona.

- Dialog can be surprising. A character might suddenly say something unexpected, revealing a hidden facet of their personality or giving away a plot twist.

- It's essential that dialog remains true to the character. A character should only say things that align with their personality and motivations, not just what the plot needs.

- When revising dialog, writers should ensure that it serves multiple purposes. It should advance the plot, provide necessary information, reveal character traits, and remain engaging.

- Realism is crucial, but dialog shouldn't just mimic actual speech, which can be repetitive and mundane. It should be a refined version of real conversation that retains a natural feel.
#### Verisimilitude and Its Limits
**Verisimilitude and Its Limits - Summary and Clarification**

**Summary**:
Dialog in literature should sound realistic without strictly mirroring real-life speech. While writers often get inspired by overheard conversations, integrating them seamlessly into their work can be challenging. Actual speech is repetitive and often circular, making it less suitable for direct inclusion in writing. Effective dialog often requires the omission of needless repetition found in real conversations. Tools like teasing, wit, and understatement help provide indirectness in dialog, which enhances subtext and emotional resonance. This indirection is illustrated in Hemingway's "Hills Like White Elephants" where characters talk around the central issue without addressing it directly. While listening to real-life conversations can offer some insights, the true art of crafting dialog is better learned by studying writers who excel in it. Acclaimed writers like Philip Roth and Joan Didion serve as exemplars for aspiring authors to learn the intricacies of dialog.

**Clarification**:
- Dialog in stories is a representation of real speech but is more concise and structured. It needs to feel genuine but without the redundancy and vagueness often present in real-life conversations.

- Even if a writer gets inspired by an actual conversation, inserting it verbatim into a story can feel forced or out of place. Thus, real-life dialog often needs to be modified for literary use.

- By employing techniques like wit, mockery, and understatement, writers can hint at deeper meanings or emotions without directly stating them, thus enriching the subtext.

- Hemingway’s story provides a clear example of how dialog can communicate deeper emotions and conflicts without directly addressing them.

- To master the art of dialog, one shouldn't just rely on eavesdropping on real conversations. Instead, studying the works of renowned authors can offer valuable insights into crafting compelling dialog. This learning process is essential until a writer develops their unique voice.
#### Specific Techniques for Enhancing Realism 
**Specific Techniques for Enhancing Realism in Dialog - Summary and Clarification**

**Summary**:
Realistic dialog in literature does not perfectly mirror real speech but employs techniques to make it seem authentic. A genuine conversation often exhibits interruptions, changing subjects, tangents, and overlapping topics. To enhance realism in dialog:

1. **Avoid a Direct Back-and-Forth**: Rather than characters responding directly to each other, have them pursue individual objectives or concerns.
2. **Push Dialog Forward**: A character can sometimes assume the answer to the preceding line and progress the conversation to the next point.
3. **Use Truncated Sentences**: When emotionally charged, characters might cut off their own sentences or those of others.
4. **Employ Subjectless Sentences**: Phrases like “Going to the school tonight?” imply familiarity or casualness.
5. **Change the Subject**: Characters might shift the topic to avoid certain subjects or to introduce a new direction in the conversation.
6. **Give Unsolicited Advice**: This can make a character feel ignored or overshadowed.
7. **Top Another’s Story**: A character might try to outdo another's story, potentially invalidating their experience.
8. **Finish Another’s Sentences**: This can suggest the second character views the first's point as trivial.
9. **Interpret What’s Said**: By paraphrasing or interpreting, a character might try to assume authority over the conversation.
10. **Dictate Another’s Feelings**: A character may try to define or belittle another's emotions.
11. **Ask Without Listening**: Posing a question without genuine interest.

All these techniques can increase the authenticity of dialog, but they must be used judiciously to avoid feeling contrived.

**Clarification**:
- While these techniques are drawn from real-life conversational habits, they need to be carefully and strategically employed in written dialog.
  
- In literature, dialog serves multiple purposes: advancing the plot, revealing character dynamics, and creating tension or resolution. Hence, it's essential that these techniques are not used merely for the sake of realism but to serve the narrative's broader goals.

- Techniques like changing the subject, giving unsolicited advice, or topping another's story can show character dynamics and power plays within a conversation. They illustrate how characters might avoid, confront, or manipulate each other, adding depth and nuance to their interactions. 

- The key is to use these techniques as tools in the writer's arsenal, applying them when they further character development or plot progression and avoiding them when they might seem unnatural or overly constructed.
#### Speech Tags
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Speech Tags:**

1. **Definition & Current Practice:** Speech tags, also known as reporting clauses, are words or phrases used to indicate who is speaking in a dialogue. Current conventions recommend primarily using "he said," "she said," and specific names followed by "said" because they are nonintrusive and maintain the flow of dialogue.
   
2. **Alternatives:** While "replied" and "responded" are acceptable alternatives, other descriptors like "cried," "demanded," and "exclaimed" are considered outdated or signs of inexperienced writing. Descriptors that mix actions, like "chuckled" or "sneered," are problematic because they can be unrealistic.

3. **Adverbs in Speech Tags:** American writers are often advised to avoid using adverbs in speech tags, e.g., "she said caringly." This is because they can distract from the dialogue and often seem unnecessary. The dialogue itself should convey the emotion. However, adverbs can be acceptable when they highlight a contradiction or irony not evident from the dialogue alone.

4. **Using Action or Setting:** Instead of relying heavily on speech tags, writers can use brief descriptions of actions or settings (called beats) to indicate who is speaking and add depth. This technique helps root the scene in its context. For instance, using a character's action like "She stirred" before her dialogue helps identify the speaker while adding a layer of emotion or context.

5. **Subplots as Background:** Introducing a subplot or parallel event that mirrors the main conversation can add depth to a dialogue scene. For example, if two characters are arguing about their failing relationship in a café, and one of them observes another person seemingly getting stood up, it can reflect and influence their own conversation. This technique allows the setting and side events to comment on the primary dialogue.

In essence, the use of speech tags should be minimal and straightforward to keep the reader's focus on the dialogue. When more context or emotion is needed, beats and subplots can be woven in to enrich the narrative.
#### Dialect, Obscenities', and Verbal Tics
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Dialect, Obscenities, and Verbal Tics in Writing:**

1. **Dialect:** 
    - Use it minimally. Overuse can draw too much attention to the style rather than the content.
    - Avoid excess apostrophes; for instance, prefer "runnin" over "runnin’."
    - Overusing specific dialectical features like double negatives (“He don’t live nowhere round here”) or words like “ain’t” can diminish their impact.

2. **Obscenities:** 
    - They can lose their impact more rapidly in written form than in spoken language.
    - It's often best to convey strong emotions without relying on obscenities. If used, ensure they're impactful and not just for the sake of it.

3. **Verbal Tics:** 
    - These are repetitive phrases or habits a character may have when speaking, such as "Oh my God" or "Know what I mean?"
    - They can give a unique voice to a character and make them more memorable. However, overuse can become annoying to the reader.

In essence, while dialect, obscenities, and verbal tics can be powerful tools to make dialogue more engaging and realistic, moderation is key. Overusing any of these elements can distract from the story and irritate readers.
#### Creating Variety Among Characters
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Creating Character Voice Variety in Dialogue:**

1. **Challenge of Homogeneity:** 
   - In scenes with multiple characters, especially those with similar backgrounds (like classmates or siblings), distinguishing their voices can be a challenge.

2. **Character Desires:** 
   - Focusing on what each character wants in a scene can guide their dialogue. Their objectives can shape how they speak, making them distinct.
   - This distinctiveness can sometimes eliminate the need for speech tags since readers can identify characters based on their motives and the way they express them.

3. **James Joyce’s “The Dead” as an Example:** 
   - Joyce’s story serves as a prime example of distinct voices among a largely homogenous group (family and friends at a Christmas gathering).
   - Each character has unique attitudes and concerns, like Gabriel's fear of appearing pompous and Aunt Kate's worry about Freddy Malins' potential drunkenness.
   - By establishing these distinct traits early on, readers can easily differentiate and understand characters throughout the narrative.

4. **Musical Metaphor by Sam Shepard:** 
   - Consider characters in a scene as players in a musical group. Each character has their unique "sound" or voice.
   - Thinking in terms of music can help visualize which character dominates a scene (like the loudness of drums) or adds subtleties (like a quiet piano).

In essence, to create variety in dialogue among characters, it's crucial to understand each character's motives, fears, and desires. This not only differentiates them but also deepens the overall narrative by adding layers of complexity to scenes.
## EPILOGUE
### The Examined Life Redux: Our Characters, Our Selves

**Summary and Clarification**:

The text delves into the intricate philosophical questions surrounding human nature, self-perception, and identity. It explores the idea that individuals do not possess a fixed and inherent personality, but rather adapt and change according to different social circumstances. 

**Main Points**:

1. **Human Identity**: Denis Diderot in "Rameau’s Nephew" suggests that the concept of a singular human personality is a relic of superstitious days. He proposed that we assume roles based on the social situations we encounter, leading to varying personalities.
  
2. **Nature of Existence**: Philosophers like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Sartre have all argued about the true nature of human existence. They hold that we don't "find" ourselves but "create" our identities through our life's daily challenges.
   
3. **Buddhist Perspective**: The idea of "No Self" in Buddhism implies that the desire to attach consciousness to the physical world causes suffering. True peace and liberation come from understanding and embracing this concept.

4. **Writer's Perspective**: For a writer, characters in a story can help them explore their own sense of identity. Writing and shaping characters offers insight into one's own persona, as it evolves and reacts to different circumstances.
   
5. **Conformity vs. Freedom**: While societal norms might dictate certain behaviors and identities, philosophers argue that life and identity are fundamentally an ongoing creation. The true essence of a person may be in continuous evolution rather than being fixed.

6. **Impact on Others**: Our actions, both good and bad, leave an imprint on the world and the people around us. The choices we make and their consequences shape our identity just as much as our inherent characteristics.
   
7. **The Writer's Journey**: Writing is a profound journey of introspection. Each piece of fiction asks questions not just about the characters within but also about the writer's own essence.

8. **Hero's Evolution**: In every story, a hero faces challenges that force them to evolve and change. This mirrors the journey of a writer or any individual, where adversity and experience lead to growth and transformation.

In essence, the text is a reflection on the fluidity of human character and the impact of external circumstances on shaping one's identity. The dynamic nature of existence is celebrated, as is the profound journey of introspection and self-discovery that writing offers.
