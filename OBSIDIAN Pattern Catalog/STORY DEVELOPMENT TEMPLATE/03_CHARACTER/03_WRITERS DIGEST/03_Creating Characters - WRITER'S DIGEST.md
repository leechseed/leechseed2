**Title**: *The Interconnection of Character and Plot in Storytelling*

Steven James uses the metaphor "The fish is in the ocean, and the ocean is in the fish" to underline the inseparable relationship between character and plot in storytelling. Characters are not merely passively existing within the events of a story; they actively shape and are shaped by them. The essence of a story is an engaging character facing a challenging situation. If either element is lacking, the story becomes dull. Characters must evoke emotional investment from readers, and if they fail to do so, the plot becomes inconsequential. In today's world, with endless distractions, it's crucial for writers to create compelling characters that captivate readers so deeply they prioritize the fictional world over their reality. While there's no formulaic way to create an engaging character, they should be three-dimensional, relatable, and lifelike. James likens the creation of characters to the biblical story where God gives life to Adam, emphasizing that writers must breathe life into their characters. This concept of intertwining character and plot is foundational to the creation of unforgettable stories. James, a best-selling author and educator, provides insights into the craft of storytelling, suggesting that character development and the narrative are intrinsically linked and dependent on each other.

## CHAPTER 2: CHARACTER CONCEPTING by Joseph Bates
**Chapter 2 Character Concepting by Joseph Bates - Summary:**

In this chapter, Joseph Bates emphasizes the paramount importance of character development in fiction writing. He posits that the essence of a compelling story lies in the characters with whom readers can connect and relate. The setting is secondary; whether it's Victorian England, Middle-Earth, or Mars, it's the characters' struggles that truly draw readers in. 

Bates argues that what makes a character authentic and relatable is their complexity. However, this complexity shouldn't arise from muddled motivations. Instead, a character's depth emerges when clear-cut desires or goals clash with the story's unfolding events. Beginning writers often misconstrue complexity, either making motivations too convoluted or making characters lack any discernible drive. For a plot to be meaningful, its events must directly challenge or threaten the character's wants.

Using Cormac McCarthy’s "The Road" as an example, Bates underscores the difference between external and internal motivations. The story's external goal is the father and son's journey south, hoping for a more sustainable environment. But this is merely a backdrop for the deeper, internal motivation: the father's determination to keep his son alive in a hopeless world. Such internal conflicts and motivations amplify the stakes of the external plot, making the story deeply resonant with readers.

Bates believes that compelling novels start with a blend of external and internal ideas. A profound understanding of what characters truly want and their limits is crucial. When character development is at the heart of a narrative, the story becomes engaging and universally relatable.

Joseph Bates is a published author and fiction writer whose works include "The Nighttime Novelist" and "Tomorrowland: Stories".

## CHAPTER 3: CHOOSE A NAME WISELY by Nancy Kress
**Summary of Chapter 3 "Choose a Name Wisely" by Nancy Kress:**

Nancy Kress delves into the importance and impact of names in fiction, highlighting the significance they hold in shaping readers' perceptions of characters. The chapter covers several critical points:

1. **Initial Impressions**: Names play a vital role in forming readers' initial impressions about a character's background, age, relationships, and traits.
 
2. **Family Background**: 
    - Ethnicity: Names can hint at a character's ethnic background. Examples include names like "Karim Abdul" suggesting Arab heritage, while "Reuben Goldstein" implies a Jewish background.
    - Heritage: A name like John Addams Carrington IV hints at a family's pride in its lineage. Meanwhile, names like Sunshine and Sweetmeadow Smith may suggest a more free-spirited family background.
    - Gender Dynamics: The naming trend has seen traditionally male names being used for females, e.g., Ashley or Madison. But the opposite is rare and needs more explanation in fiction.
  
3. **Character’s Age**: Names can subtly hint at a character’s age, with certain names being popular in specific eras. For instance, the names Gladys and Myrtle were common a century ago, but not today.

4. **Personal Relationships**: How different characters address one another can shed light on their relationship dynamics. Different variations of a name or nickname can provide insights into personal histories and interactions.

5. **Character Personality**: Naming characters to reflect their personalities is tricky in modern fiction. While it worked in older literature (like Dickens's Uriah Heep), it may appear too on-the-nose in contemporary fiction, except in comedic or children's literature.

Kress concludes by emphasizing the importance of careful selection of names in fiction, as they bear significant weight in character development and reader perception. She advises writers to be mindful of these factors and employ names strategically.
## CHAPTER 4: NAME-DROPPING by Elizabeth Sims
**Chapter 4 Summary: "Name-Dropping" by Elizabeth Sims**

In this chapter, Elizabeth Sims discusses the art and importance of naming characters in literature.

1. **Joyce Carol Oates Lecture:** The chapter opens with a recounting of a lecture by Joyce Carol Oates at Michigan State University. Oates emphasized her connection with her characters and the significance of selecting appropriate names for them. The power of a character's name can deeply impact the reader's impression and memory of them.
  
2. **The Power of a Name:** Sims points out that many iconic characters from literature have names that resonate deeply with readers, citing examples like Dracula, Holly Golightly, and Atticus Finch. She advises writers against using placeholder or nonsensical names in drafts, emphasizing that a character's name influences the writer's perception and development of that character.

3. **Types of Names:** Sims divides character names into two categories:
   - **Layered Names:** These names carry symbolic, ironic, or phonetic significance. For instance, ironic names might contrast with a character's personality or circumstances. Symbolic names hold deeper meaning related to the character's essence or journey. Connotative names suggest particular qualities without being overt, and phonetically suggestive names create an auditory impression related to the character's nature.
   - **Plain Names:** These are names that may not have a clear symbolic meaning but sound right and resonate with readers. Examples include Anna Karenina and Frankenstein. They're often found through inspiration, research, or serendipitous discovery.

4. **Methods to Find Names:** Sims provides various techniques for generating names. They include:
   - Awaiting spontaneous inspiration.
   - Using phone books or baby-name books.
   - Surfing the internet for name databases or generators.
   - Visiting libraries, especially the genealogy section, which offers a treasure trove of names from various eras and geographies.

5. **Tips for Naming Characters:** 
   - Understand the root meaning of names to ensure they align with the character's nature.
   - Choose era-appropriate names.
   - Test names by speaking them aloud.
   - Diversify names in a story with different initials and syllable counts to avoid confusion.
   - Use alliteration for standout characters.
   - Ensure names are clear and won't be confused with real individuals to avoid potential legal issues or misunderstandings.

Throughout the chapter, Sims emphasizes the essential role of a character's name in storytelling. A well-chosen name can enhance the reader's connection to the character and enrich the overall narrative.
## CHAPTER 5: INTRODUCING YOUR CHARACTER FOR THE FIRST TIME by Jeff Gerke
**Summary of Chapter 5: "Introducing Your Character for the First Time" by Jeff Gerke**

In fiction, how you first introduce your main character is of paramount importance. This chapter emphasizes the significance of the initial impression readers get of your protagonist. It's not just about action but about capturing the true essence of the character in that introduction.

* **First Impressions Matter**: Just as the James Bond films always start with an action-packed scene that perfectly captures 007's character, authors should aim to introduce their characters in ways that make a lasting and defining impression. 

* **Revealing the Essence**: The chapter cites the opening sequence of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" as an exemplary introduction. In just a short span, viewers understand who Indiana Jones is—his strengths, fears, and personality—without him saying much.

* **Craft a Short Story Introduction**: To nail the character's introduction, think of it as a short story. Start with the core essence of the character and develop a scene around it. The scene doesn’t have to be action-packed, it just needs to be fitting for the genre and storyline. 

* **Reveal Goals and Traits**: This introduction scene should not only reveal what the character wants but also highlight her likable traits. Readers are going to invest their time in your book, so they should find the main character engaging and relatable, even if she has flaws.

* **Introducing Other Characters**: While the protagonist's introduction is crucial, secondary characters—like the antagonist, love interest, sidekicks, etc.—should also have memorable introductions. Their introductions should give readers a clear insight into their roles and personalities.

* **Smaller Character Introductions**: Even minor characters can have impactful introductions. The chapter mentions Barliman Butterburr from "The Lord of the Rings" as an example. His small role is significant, and his introduction paints a clear picture of his personality.

* **Opening Without a Prologue**: If an author chooses not to start with a prologue, then the opening scene has to accomplish three things: set the tone of the story, introduce the main character, and captivate the reader. It's challenging but can be effectively achieved, as seen in movies like those of James Bond and Indiana Jones.

* **Author Bio**: Jeff Gerke is a versatile writer known for several Writer’s Digest books. He is also the founder of Marcher Lord Press and offers various freelance services like editing and book cover designs.

In essence, the chapter underscores the importance of introducing characters in a way that captures their true nature and sets the tone for the entire story. This introduction lays the groundwork for the relationship between the reader and the characters, ensuring a captivating reading experience.
# PART II: POINT OF VIEW

## CHAPTER 6: WHOSE EMOTIONS ARE WE SHARING? by Nancy Kress

**Summary of "Whose Emotions Are We Sharing?" by Nancy Kress**

In the realm of storytelling, point of view (POV) determines through whose eyes and mind the reader experiences the narrative. This piece by Nancy Kress delves into the concept of point of view, highlighting the distinction between the protagonist (the story's main character) and the POV character.

**Main Points:**

1. **Human Imprisonment in Our Own Minds**: Nancy starts by emphasizing our human limitation of experiencing life only from our individual perspective due to the absence of telepathy. This inherent isolation makes fiction enthralling, as it provides an avenue to perceive the world from another person's perspective.

2. **Protagonist vs. POV Character**: The protagonist is the central character, typically the most interesting individual with the pivotal action. It's common for the protagonist to also be the POV character. However, some narratives differentiate the two, leading to intriguing outcomes.

   - *Examples of Distinct Protagonist and POV*:
     - In **"The Great Gatsby"** by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the story revolves around Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, especially Gatsby. However, it's narrated by Nick Carraway, a character mostly on the narrative's periphery.
     - **"The Moon and Sixpence"** by W. Somerset Maugham centers on Charles Strickland (inspired by Paul Gauguin), but the tale is told by an unnamed narrator who knows Strickland tangentially. Here, the story lacks directness since most significant events in Strickland's life occur away from the narrator's immediate experience.

3. **Advantages of a Distinct Protagonist and POV Character**:

   - The story can proceed after the protagonist's demise. Both Jay Gatsby and Charles Strickland die in their novels, but the story continues via the POV characters.
   - The protagonist remains enigmatic if they aren't the POV character. Gatsby's genuine past remains hidden until his death, and Strickland's life remains largely a mystery.
   - POV characters can provide observations that might not occur to the protagonist. For instance, Nick Carraway has insights about other characters that they themselves might not realize.

4. **Key Questions for Authors**:
   - Authors must decide if the protagonist and POV characters will be the same and weigh the potential gains and losses of their decision.
   - It's also vital to determine which other characters might serve the role of POV.

In essence, the chapter underscores the pivotal decisions authors must make about point of view. These choices impact how readers engage with and interpret the story, making POV a critical component of effective storytelling.

**Summary of "Different Eyes, Different Story"**

**Choosing the Point of View (POV) Character:**
1. **Story Impacts Based on Different POVs**: The choice of a POV character can change the whole dynamic and emotion of a story. Using the example of a child abduction, different POVs will provide distinct narratives:
   - **Parents' POV**: A story of distress and despair, possibly showcasing the dissolution of a marriage, affairs, or private quests for revenge or justice.
   - **Child's POV**: A tale of confusion, fear, and potential escape, but missing out on the family's turmoil and police investigation.
   - **Neighbor's POV**: A narrative focused on the wrong accusation, which can evoke strong reader sympathy for an innocent underdog.
   - **Abductor's POV**: A potentially dark exploration of the antagonist's motivations, be it evil or insanity.
   - **Police Officer's/FBI Agent's POV**: A mystery or procedural that delves into the investigative process.

2. **Rethinking the Obvious POV**: The initial choice of POV might not always be the best. There are existing tales retold from alternative POVs that offer fresh and intriguing takes, such as "Wide Sargasso Sea" (a retelling of "Jane Eyre" from the first Mrs. Rochester's perspective), "Mary Reilly" (a version of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" from a maid's view), and "Cinderella’s Rat" (Cinderella's story from a rat's perspective). Writers should ponder which character might provide a novel or compelling viewpoint on the plot.

**Managing Multiple Points of View:**
1. **Determining the Number of POVs**: There's no definitive rule regarding the number of POVs to include in a story. However, the guideline is to minimize the count while still effectively conveying the desired narrative. Switching too frequently between numerous POVs can disorient readers and break the flow of the story.
   
2. **Reasons for Multiple POVs**: There are scenarios where having more than one POV benefits the narrative. For instance:
   - To show varying perspectives on an event or relationship.
   - When one character can't be present at all pivotal scenes.
   - To address intricate plots or grand sagas that require insights from multiple characters.

3. **Limitations and Challenges**: Juggling multiple viewpoints can be challenging for writers and readers alike. For the reader, remembering numerous character arcs can be taxing. For the writer, maintaining consistency, depth, and relevance for each POV character can be daunting.

4. **Next Steps after Choosing POV**: After finalizing the POV character(s), a writer must decide on the narrative voice: first person, third person, or omniscient.

In essence, the section underscores the transformative power of POV selection in storytelling, emphasizing the need to judiciously decide on the viewpoint to provide readers with a compelling and coherent narrative experience.

---
**Summary:**

**Point of View in Writing: An Overview**

- **First Person (I) POV:**
  - Told from a singular perspective using "I".
  - Offers immediacy: the reader experiences events directly through the character's eyes.
  - Allows for a distinct language or tone.
  - Offers range, including memories and personal opinions.
  - Limitations: Only scenes where the POV character is present can be included. Information must align with what the character knows.
  - Risk: The writer might inadvertently merge their thoughts with the character's, creating a blurred perspective.

- **Third Person (He, She, It) POV:**
  - Narration from an external perspective. 
  - Limited third-person focuses on one character, while multiple third-person delves into multiple characters' minds.
  - Advantages: Describes characters from the outside, presents objective facts, feels less "claustrophobic", can use multiple viewpoints, and can withhold information.
  - Disadvantages: Greater distance between reader and character, less unique language, and challenges with memory and flashback narratives.

- **Choosing Between First and Third Person:**
  - Consider the scope of your story and how you want to present your material.
  - Consider how closely you want readers to identify with the character.

- **Omniscient POV:**
  - The author knows all and can dip into any character's mind.
  - Can provide commentary and directly address readers.
  - It offers great flexibility but is the most challenging to execute properly.

**About the Author:**
Nancy Kress has written numerous books, spanning novels, short story collections, and writing guides. She has won several prestigious awards for her work. She teaches writing and has been a visiting lecturer at various international venues.

## CHAPTER 7: WHAT POV COMMUNICATES ABOUT YOUR STORY by Alicia Rasley
**Summary:**

**Chapter 7: "What POV Communicates About Your Story" by Alicia Rasley**

* The chapter emphasizes that the **point of view (POV)** one chooses to write from should serve the story's needs rather than personal preferences. The kind of stories authors enjoy reading or writing can provide insights into the most suitable POV for them.
  
* Different POV approaches echo distinct themes in storytelling:
  * **First-person** reflects on identity and persona.
  * **Second-person** considers identity construction.
  * **Objective POV** ponders the existence of objective reality.
  * **Classical omniscient** dives into human society and interactions.
  * **Contemporary omniscient** focuses on the tension between societal needs and individual freedom.
  * **Third-person limited** explores internal conflicts and desires.
  * **Third-person omniscient** examines how perspective depends on one's stance.

* It's important to consider if a story is more of a **"social novel"** (focused on group/community interactions) or a **"personal novel"** (zeroed in on a central protagonist's experience). The choice will impact the narrative focus, be it multiple or single viewpoints.

* The title of a story often reflects its focal point, hinting at whether it emphasizes individual characters or a group.

* Genre plays a significant role in POV considerations:
  * Mystery novels often stick to the detective's POV.
  * Romances usually allow readers to dive into the minds of both the hero and heroine.
  * Literary and historical works might focus on a single first-person perspective but can also experiment with multiple alternating narrators.
  
* For writers, understanding genre conventions, especially concerning POV, is crucial. While it's okay to break from the norm, understanding established norms helps writers connect with their audience. Different genres come with varying expectations about POV, which can influence the reader's experience.

In summary, Alicia Rasley's chapter dives deep into how the choice of POV can shape, enhance, and dictate the thematic undertones of a story. This decision should be informed by the story's core themes, the nature of its plot, and the expectations of its genre.

4. **Legal and Medical Thrillers**:
   - Focus on crime within societal institutions, such as courts or hospitals.
   - Often use multiple POVs to offer comprehensive insights into the system.
   - The main challenge for authors is to maintain a close connection with a primary protagonist while providing other viewpoints.

In essence, the choice of POV in crime fiction plays a pivotal role in shaping the reader's experience, be it solving a puzzle, experiencing suspense, or exploring the intricacies of societal systems.

**Summary**:

**Emotion Novels: Horror and Romance**

1. **Horror Novels**:
   - Aims to create a personal sense of terror and an overarching awareness of evil.
   - Stephen King typically employs a contemporary-omniscient POV, often focusing tightly on a single character once the scene starts. He's also used first-person narration for entire books, building a strong connection with the victim.
   - Dean Koontz crafts passages that evoke a tight, almost claustrophobic feeling, usually from the perspective of a victim or a deranged antagonist.
   - The horror genre commonly utilizes some form of omniscient POV to amplify the overarching menace of supernatural presences and the foreboding aura around characters.

2. **Romance Novels**:

   - Romances may contain an external plot, such as a mystery or quest, but the primary focus remains on the protagonists' relationship.
   - The challenge in romance is to craft distinct POVs, ensuring both the hero and heroine are captivating and relatable.

3. **Women’s Fiction**:
   - Difficult to pin down but usually resonates more with female readers.
   - Themes often emphasize relationships and personal growth.
   - Can feature male protagonists or even elements of violence, but the spotlight remains on personal and relational dynamics.
   - Depending on the emphasis on character or community, these novels might employ tight limited third-person, first-person, multiple, or contemporary-omniscient POVs.
   - Some community-focused novels in this category, like those by Jan Karon and Debbie Macomber, are categorized as general fiction instead of romance.

In essence, while crime stories engage readers on an intellectual level, emotion novels like horror and romance tap into deeper emotional experiences.

   - Two main sub-genres:
     - Techno-thrillers like Tom Clancy's works.
     - Shorter “special-ops” books, often part of a series, such as Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir’s The Destroyer.
   - While Westerns are tied to the setting and slower rhythms of the American frontier, action-adventures are hypermodern, focusing on contemporary technology and events.
   - Techno-thrillers provide extensive details on technology using a contemporary-omniscient POV, catering to an audience that values precision.
   - Special-ops books are generally shorter, with a POV tightly focused on one character or a small team. The prose is often sharp, aiming to create a visceral experience of danger.
   - A major challenge in action-adventures is to maintain an authentic narrator voice that can explain complex technology while keeping the action flowing.

In essence, while both genres cater primarily to a male audience, Westerns emphasize the ethos of the American frontier, whereas action-adventures are rooted in modern technology and current events. The choice of POV in each sub-genre serves to enhance the reader's experience and immersion.

**Summary**:

**General Fiction**:

- **Description**: General fiction, sometimes called mainstream or contemporary fiction, is a broad category that doesn't strictly adhere to genre-specific conventions. Instead, it targets a wide audience and is usually separated from genre novels or literary fiction in stores and libraries.
  
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Contains elements from various genres without sticking to a single genre's conventions.
  - These novels often appeal to a vast audience, and their content can be diverse, from tragic to comedic, family sagas to war dramas, and so on.
  - Some genre-structured novels are classified as general fiction if they are more extensive or more encompassing. Notable examples include P.D. James' mysteries and Nora Roberts' romances.
  - Most bestsellers and many "Oprah books" fall under this category.
  
- **POV Approaches**:
  - Experimental POVs (e.g., second person) are uncommon since they shift the emphasis from the story itself to its narration.
  - While multiple POVs are rare, first-person and third-person limited are frequently used.
  - Omniscient POV is more prevalent in general fiction than in genre fiction, aligning with a more classical narrative style.
  
- **Purpose**: The main objective of general fiction is to narrate a compelling story without being bound by specific genre rules. The choice of POV should prioritize the story's needs, focusing on the tightness of the narrative's focus.
  - For personal tales like Marek Halter's "Sarah", intimate POVs like first-person or third-person limited are suitable.
  - For broader cultural portrayals like "The Bookseller of Kabul" by Asne Seierstad, an omniscient approach works best.
  
- **Challenge**: The challenge for authors in this category is selecting the ideal POV from a broad array of options that best complements their story.

**Summary**:

**Literary Fiction**:

- **Definition**: Literary fiction doesn't strictly adhere to conventional storytelling genres. It often experiments with language, style, and narrative structures. While it may have a plot, the focus often lies in how small events profoundly impact characters.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Examples like Vladimir Nabokov's "Lolita" highlight the journey motif, showing the effects of modern life on character development.
  - The term "literary fiction" typically refers to post-WWI works. Earlier writings are just termed "literature," such as the works of Dickens and Austen. Interestingly, themes and structures found in these classics are more commonly seen in contemporary popular fiction.
  - Literary fiction's experimental nature differentiates it from its influences, while popular fiction tends to follow more traditional formats from previous eras.
  
- **POV Approaches**:
  - Most literary fiction uses a focused POV, either first person or third, taking inspiration from modernist writers like James Joyce.
  - However, they often delve deeper, utilizing POV to unearth hidden story and character aspects, introduce innovative prose, and sometimes even challenge the narrative's reliability.
  - Narrative experimentation frequently includes experimenting with POV. For instance, Joyce employed a third-person POV that was so deeply internal, it mimicked a person's chaotic thought processes, a style termed "stream of consciousness."
  
- **Purpose and Attention**: Literary fiction aims to provide a fresh and inventive storytelling approach. Deep character introspection, novel prose, and creative imagery are essential. Aspiring writers in this genre should pay special attention to innovative narrative techniques, including their choice of POV, to engage and captivate literary editors.

In essence, literary fiction stands out by bending traditional storytelling rules and often offers a profound exploration of characters through innovative narrative techniques, including experimental points of view.

**Summary**:

**Postmodernism: A Reminder of Fiction's Illusory Nature**

- **Characteristics**: Postmodern novels, falling under literary fiction, are highly experimental. Unlike traditional novels that seek to immerse readers, postmodern narratives constantly remind readers of the artificiality of the story.
  
- **Metafictional Techniques**: These novels employ various metafictional methods to disrupt traditional narrative structures, such as:
  - Providing multiple endings, as seen in John Fowles’s *The French Lieutenant’s Woman*.
  - Introducing seemingly unrelated details, like Thomas Pynchon's mention of JFK’s excrement in *Gravity’s Rainbow*.
  - Incorporating academic elements like footnotes, as in David Foster Wallace’s *Infinite Jest*.

- **POV in Postmodernism**: One might expect any POV approach to be acceptable in a postmodernist setting. However, it should ideally further the experiment's objective. While traditional novelists might present varying perspectives to invite readers to decipher the truth, postmodernists might shuffle POVs to argue the absence of an objective truth, suggesting the quest for it is in vain. An example is Robert Coover’s *The Babysitter*.

- **Challenges and Philosophy**: The postmodern approach can be daunting for many writers who genuinely believe that fiction can reveal truths. Yet, if you're skeptical of fiction's capacity to convey genuine truths and lean more towards artistic relativism, postmodernism may be your calling. Always remember, the underlying mantra for postmodernism is "This book is a lie." Hence, the POV should cast skepticism on your narrative's validity, contrasting the usual narrative aim.

**Final Advice**: Though this summary provides a snapshot of various fiction genres, reading extensively in your desired genre is invaluable. While your work will be unique, understanding its relation and distinction from existing literature will significantly impact its reception.
## CHAPTER 8: DEALING WITH MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEW by Jordan E. Rosenfeld

**Summary of Chapter 8: Dealing with Multiple Points of View by Jordan E. Rosenfeld**

**Points of View in Fiction:**
- Point of view (POV) acts as a camera, allowing the reader to enter the protagonist's world.
- Maintaining consistency and integrity in POV is essential; otherwise, readers may feel disoriented.
- Mastering POV involves smooth transitions and ensuring that the chosen POV complements the narrative.

**Story Arc of Multiple Protagonists:**
- Each protagonist must have a narrative arc and their storylines should intersect.
- Their individual journeys need to merge by the end to create a cohesive narrative.
- A few successful books with multiple protagonists are highlighted, including "A Thousand Splendid Suns" and "My Sister’s Keeper."

**Using Multiple Points of View in Scenes:**
- Scenes are containers of significant actions where a protagonist has an intention, faces conflict, and experiences change.
- Multiple POVs in scenes can be complex. Choosing the correct POV requires consideration of the intended effect and the characters involved.
- Omniscient POV allows for viewing events from multiple character perspectives and is useful when dealing with extensive subjects.
- However, omniscient POV can be challenging; it requires clarity from the start and careful handling to avoid reader confusion.

**Tips on POV in Omniscient:**
- Introduce it clearly from the first scene.
- Transition between characters with new paragraphs and avoid overloading a scene with too many character POVs.
- An example from Anne Lamott's "Rosie" demonstrates skillful use of the omniscient POV.

**Changing POV from Scene to Scene:**
- Scenes are best contained in one location.
- When using multiple scenes in a chapter, think of them as pieces of a puzzle contributing to the chapter's goal.
- Each scene within a chapter should ideally have only one viewpoint.
- Jodi Picoult's "Second Glance" is provided as an example of effectively using multiple scenes in a chapter.

**Changing POV from Chapter to Chapter:**
- One chapter can sometimes be just one long scene.
- Having one scene per chapter simplifies POV structure and allows for deeper focus on a single protagonist.
- Choosing the type of POV for a chapter depends on various factors like setting, type of scene, and chronology.

**Devoting Equal Time to POV Characters:**
- For a balanced narrative, give equal time to each protagonist.
- An alternating pattern like ABC, ABC, or AAA, BBB, CCC can be adopted for different protagonists.
- The ultimate goal is to provide each POV character with nearly equal narrative space.

**About the Author:** Jordan E. Rosenfeld is a suspense novelist and has written books like "Night Oracle" and "Forged in Grace."

# PART III: DIALOGUE

## CHAPTER 9: WRITING DIALOGUE by Hallie Ephron
**Summary & Clarification**

---

**WRITING DIALOGUE BY HALLIE EPHRON**

*Hallie Ephron admits that dialogue is her Achilles' heel in writing. While she can vividly recall visual details, she struggles with remembering exact spoken words. Authentic dialogue should be more than just paraphrasing, as the latter can cause characters to sound alike or indistinct.*

---

**WRITING CONVINCING DIALOGUE**

The key to writing convincing dialogue can be derived from a short excerpt from "LaBrava" by Elmore Leonard. Here are the techniques used in that dialogue:

1. **Content and Tone**: What the character says and how they say it should reflect their personality. In the given example, Cundo Rey's dialogue about a snake eating a bat reveals a sinister, strange, and confrontational side of him.
  
2. **Grammar and Word Choices**: Use grammar to hint at the character's background and personality. For instance, incorrect grammar might imply a non-native English speaker or someone with less education.

3. **Dialect**: Characters might have accents or unique pronunciations. However, overusing phonetically rendered dialects can distract readers and risk turning characters into stereotypes. It's best to provide just a hint of dialect and trust the reader's imagination.

4. **Attribution**: New writers often over-complicate dialogue attribution with varied verbs (e.g., chimed, hissed, bellowed). In most cases, "said" or "asked" is enough. Avoid unnecessary adverbs and ensure that verbs logically relate to speaking.

5. **Combine Dialogue and Action**: Pair dialogue with appropriate actions to enhance the emotional impact. For example, Nobles eating while talking about the snake amplifies the tension.

6. **Reflect Relationships**: The exchange between characters should reveal their relationship dynamics. In the example, the back-and-forth between Cundo Rey and Nobles indicates a challenge of bravado.

7. **Internal Dialogue**: Occasionally using internal dialogue can provide insight into a character's thoughts during an exchange, adding depth to the conversation. This doesn't require quotes or italics, just maintaining the same tense and point of view.

In conclusion, writing convincing dialogue requires a mix of content, tone, grammar, dialect, and relationship dynamics. Proper attribution, action combination, and sporadic use of internal dialogue can further enhance the reader's experience.

**Summary & Clarification**

---

**MAKING DIALOGUE SOUND AUTHENTIC**

While authentic dialogue aims to capture real speech, it shouldn't be a direct replication. Real conversations have irrelevant tangents, repetitions, and dull moments that can make written dialogue tiresome. For dialogue to be engaging:
- Use sentence fragments, vernacular, and occasional profanity.
- Edit out the meandering, repetitive, and irrelevant parts.
- Avoid overly clever lines that draw attention to themselves.

A tip to verify dialogue quality is to read it aloud; if it sounds unnatural or forced, it may need revision.

---

**SHOWING EMOTIONS**

"Presencing" is the technique of making characters appear physically present in the narrative by pairing their dialogue with physical actions. This gives insight into their emotions or thoughts. For example, how a character interacts with a drink while speaking can change the interpretation of their dialogue. Other props or actions, like playing with a strand of hair or adjusting a necktie, can also hint at a character's emotional state. These subtle actions, when combined with dialogue, provide depth to the character's feelings.

---

**WHEN TO SUMMARIZE INSTEAD**

Not all character conversations need to be detailed. In situations where dialogue doesn't add drama, character development, or story progression, it's better to summarize. For instance, instead of scripting out mundane greetings, simply stating, "He introduced himself and we shook hands," suffices. Dialogue should be reserved for dramatic moments, character development, or relationship-building. Avoid having characters deliver lengthy, exposition-heavy speeches.

## CHAPTER 10: DIALOGUE THAT PROPELS THE STORY FORWARD by Gloria Kempton

**Summary & Clarification**

**DIALOGUE THAT PROPELS THE STORY FORWARD BY GLORIA KEMPTON**

Gloria Kempton reflects on a time when she reviewed a novel manuscript where the dialogue consisted of two characters having a mundane breakfast conversation. The narrative lacked energy and seemed disconnected from the larger story. When Kempton shared this dialogue with her novel class, students proposed several changes to make it more engaging. Suggestions included introducing unexpected events like a spaceship landing, the husband revealing a secret, or the sudden demise of a character.

Kempton's key takeaway is that dialogue shouldn't be mere chatter. Instead, it must contribute meaningfully to the story, moving the plot forward, adding suspense, and tying into the overarching theme. Many writers struggle with crafting purposeful dialogue, but without it, the story can feel pointless and unengaging.

---
**Summary & Clarification**

---

### DIALOGUE THAT MOVES
**DIALOGUE THAT MOVES**

For a story to be captivating, it's vital that its dialogue pushes the plot forward. Dialogue isn't just about conversation; it's a pivotal fiction element designed to advance the narrative. When characters engage in dialogue, it should create conflict and reveal their internal struggles. This struggle is tied both to the story’s theme (internal) and plot (external).

The author mentions that some writers question the need for theme or plot. However, for those aiming for publication, stories must embody both these elements to resonate with readers. Through dialogue, writers can:
1. Provide fresh insights into the ongoing conflict.
2. Introduce new challenges that the protagonist has to face.
3. Illuminate the relationships between characters, which further emphasizes the story's theme.
4. Mark significant turning points in the plot.
5. Remind readers and characters of the scene's objectives.
6. Enhance suspense and escalate the emotional stakes.

To evaluate if one's dialogue is effectively advancing the story, the author proposes a series of questions. These inquiries assess whether the dialogue is indispensable, if it aligns with the theme, and how it contributes to the suspense, stakes, and evolution of characters. Ideally, every dialogue should modify the characters' situations, drawing them nearer or farther from their objectives. When the story's theme is clear, characters will engage in focused discussions that enrich the narrative.

---

#### It Provides New Information
**Summary & Clarification**

---

**Using Dialogue to Introduce New Information**

One compelling way to make dialogue engaging is by introducing unexpected information that takes the plot in a new direction. These are pivotal moments where characters get surprising information that makes them see situations or other characters in a new light. Pivotal scenes, as described in Albert Zuckerman's book "Writing the Blockbuster Novel," are crucial to the narrative. He suggests that an average novel should have at least twelve such scenes. These pivotal scenes don't necessarily have to be dialogue-driven, but using dialogue to steer them ensures that the conversation is propelling the story forward.

For instance, in John Grisham’s "The Chamber," a pivotal dialogue passage drastically alters the protagonist's world. The character Adam, a young and naive lawyer, always inadvertently challenges the older lawyers at his firm. In a significant conversation with Goodman, another character, Adam discovers there's an effort to get him dismissed from his job, orchestrated by a person named Daniel Rosen. This new piece of information presents a significant obstacle to Adam's primary goal in the story: obtaining a reprieve for his grandfather, who is on death row. The information, given through dialogue, directly threatens Adam's aim and introduces a high-stakes scenario.

In essence, to make dialogue more dynamic and purposeful, it's effective to introduce information that changes the trajectory of the plot or challenges the protagonist in achieving their goals. Grisham's works are particularly good at this, making them useful study material for writers aiming to enhance their dialogue-driven pivotal scenes.

#### It Reveals New Obstacles

**Summary & Clarification**

---

**Using Dialogue to Introduce Obstacles**

Dialogue can serve as an effective tool to introduce challenges or obstacles that characters must face, creating tension and driving the plot forward. The sudden introduction of an obstacle can halt a character's progression, forcing them to deal with the problem immediately. This creates a sense of conflict and urgency within the narrative.

* **Conflict Creation**: Even if characters have a good rapport, the introduction of an obstacle can strain their relationship, leading to conflict. As seen in Grisham's "The Chamber", the protagonist, Adam, grows increasingly agitated during a conversation in which he learns of a significant roadblock in his quest. The dynamics of the dialogue shift as a result, enhancing the scene's tension.

* **Perception of Obstacles**: The protagonist's perception of the challenge is critical. Even if an obstacle might seem minor to some, if the protagonist perceives it as a significant threat, it amplifies the tension. The character's belief that a challenge is daunting, even if it's momentary, adds to the suspense and propels the story forward.

* **Varied Responses to Challenges**: Characters have distinct personalities, which dictate their reactions to obstacles. Some might cry, others might tackle the problem head-on, some might avoid it, and some might blame others. Understanding each character's personality is vital because their unique reactions determine the story's direction.

In conclusion, presenting characters with challenges through dialogue is a dynamic way to instill tension and shape the narrative. Knowing each character's personality and potential reactions is key to crafting authentic and engaging dialogue-driven conflicts.
#### It Increases Suspense
**Summary & Clarification**

---

**Using Dialogue to Boost Suspense**

**1. Progressing the Story with Suspense:** As a story unfolds, increasing suspense keeps readers engaged. Dialogue is a potent tool for this, allowing characters to reveal and confront rising stakes in real-time. The suspense is palpable when the stakes become evident to both the characters and the readers.

**2. Illustrative Example - "The Robber Bride":** Margaret Atwood masterfully uses dialogue to ratchet up suspense in her novel, "The Robber Bride". The cunning antagonist, Zenia, continually surprises and manipulates other characters with her schemes. While the reader is aware of Zenia's manipulative tactics, the characters themselves are often only mildly conscious of her deceit. For instance, in one dialogue, Zenia probes the protagonist, Tony, with disturbing questions about mortality and power. These interactions reveal Zenia’s desire to be feared, which she believes is the most effective way to manipulate others. Through conversations like these, Atwood showcases Zenia's increasing power and influence over others, building suspense as Tony gradually becomes aware of Zenia's true intentions.

**3. Realizations and Adjustments:** Suspense is heightened when characters start to recognize discrepancies or when they feel something is amiss. It's not only about overt threats but also about characters sensing underlying agendas, questioning the status quo, or reevaluating their decisions. 

**4. Types of Suspenseful Moments:** Various elements can instill suspense in dialogue:
   - Discovering new, unsettling information
   - Recognizing another character's ulterior motives 
   - Making decisions that suggest a plot twist
   - Internal thoughts that contradict spoken words
   - Moments where characters feel threatened, lose something valuable, or perceive injustice

**5. Integration with Plot and Theme:** For dialogue-driven suspense to be effective, it should align closely with the story’s overarching plot and theme. This ensures that suspenseful moments not only engage readers but also progress the narrative.

In conclusion, dialogue is an invaluable tool in building suspense. When characters confront unexpected challenges, realize hidden truths, or face internal dilemmas through their conversations, the story becomes more gripping, ensuring readers remain hooked.
#### It Furthers the Tension

**Summary & Clarification**

---

**Using Dialogue to Enhance Tension and Theme**

**1. Recognizing Theme in Dialogue:** Dialogue in movies or books often encapsulates the story's central theme. For instance, Geoffrey Rush's line in the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" reflects the film's theme about the moral complexities of choosing between the 'right' and 'wrong' paths. Though viewers or readers might not explicitly identify these thematic lines, such moments resonate deeply and are perceived as significant turning points.

**2. "The Notebook" by Nicholas Sparks:** Nicholas Sparks uses dialogue to emphasize the story's theme of enduring love. The story revolves around an elderly couple, Noah and Allie, with Allie suffering from Alzheimer's. Despite the difficulties, Noah's unwavering love remains steadfast. A notable dialogue scene occurs when a night nurse, having observed Noah's deep devotion, confronts him about visiting his wife late at night. Their conversation reiterates the theme of enduring love, especially in the face of adversity. The nurse, recognizing Noah's profound love, acknowledges its rarity and power.

**3. Power of Dialogue in Highlighting Theme:** Dialogue doesn’t just move the plot forward; it can crystallize the story’s theme in the minds of the audience. While actions can showcase a character's sentiments, dialogue can validate and bring clarity to those sentiments. In "The Notebook", the nurse's interaction with Noah doesn’t merely showcase her understanding but serves as a testament to the depth of Noah's love, driving home the story's theme before its conclusion.

In conclusion, dialogue plays a crucial role in amplifying tension and solidifying themes in a story. When used adeptly, it can serve as a window into a character's soul, providing readers or viewers with a deeper understanding of the narrative's core message.

#### It Shows Character Transformation 
**Summary & Clarification**

---

**Dialogue Demonstrating Character Transformation in "The Great Santini"**

**1. Role of Dialogue in Depicting Change:** Fiction often illustrates character evolution throughout the story. Effective dialogue can capture profound moments of change that leave an indelible mark on characters and the audience alike.

**2. Scene Description from "The Great Santini" by Pat Conroy:** In a pivotal scene, Bull Meecham challenges his son, Ben, to a basketball game, hoping to defeat and belittle him, a habitual behavior of Bull's. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Ben wins. This victory disrupts the family dynamics, triggering bold responses from other family members, particularly Lillian, Ben's mother.

**3. Dialogue Highlighting Transformation:** The aftermath of the game showcases significant shifts in the characters:
   - Bull's attempt to alter the game rules after losing reveals his desperation to maintain dominance.
   - Lillian confronts Bull, defending her son's win and asserting herself against her husband's domineering nature.
   - Ben shows newfound confidence in wanting to face his father again, even after the victory.
   - The confrontation ends with Lillian pointing out Bull's diminishing stature and Ben's emerging strength in the family.

**4. Thematic Significance:** The basketball game and ensuing dialogue signify a pivotal shift in the story. While Bull's character starts to shrink in stature, other family members grow in prominence, reflecting the book's theme of personal growth and transformation. This scene in particular symbolizes forgiveness and the balance of power within a family unit.

In conclusion, Pat Conroy's "The Great Santini" uses dialogue effectively to portray a transformational moment where familial dynamics shift, emphasizing the theme of growth, forgiveness, and the ever-changing balance of power.
#### It Reveals and Reminds Goals
**Summary & Clarification**

---

**Dialogue Underscoring Character Goals in "Saint Maybe" by Anne Tyler**

**1. Significance of Character Goals:** Establishing a protagonist's intentions and goals in each scene is crucial in storytelling. Through action and dialogue, readers get insights into the protagonist's motivations, which pushes the narrative forward.

**2. Scene Description from "Saint Maybe":** The excerpt focuses on Ian, who's plagued with guilt over his belief that he indirectly caused his brother Danny's suicide. This overwhelming guilt has pushed Ian to make significant life changes, such as dropping out of college to support his mother and Danny's stepchildren. Seeking penance and forgiveness is Ian's overarching goal.

**3. The Pivotal Dialogue:** In a confrontational scene with his parents:
   - Ian tries to confess his perceived wrongdoing.
   - His mother turns the focus to herself, seeing herself as a victim of her children's actions.
   - Ian emphasizes his quest for self-forgiveness.
   - Upon confessing he believes his actions caused Danny's death, Ian is met with silence. Despite his heartfelt plea for understanding and validation, he's left without the consolation he seeks.

**4. Thematic Importance:** The dialogue reinforces Ian's need for forgiveness. When Ian verbalizes, "It’s something I have to do for myself to be forgiven," it underscores the story's central theme, which is Ian's quest for redemption.

**5. Utility of Dialogue:** Dialogue serves as a powerful tool to not only reveal character intentions but to also reaffirm them throughout the narrative. By having Ian express his goal aloud, readers get a direct insight into his internal struggles. It's a vivid and immediate way to show, not just tell, a character's drive.

In conclusion, Anne Tyler's "Saint Maybe" uses dialogue as an effective medium to highlight and remind readers of Ian's internal quest for forgiveness. By stating his intentions openly, the narrative remains centered around his journey towards redemption.
### KEEPING YOUR CHARACTERS IN SOCIAL SETTINGS
CLARIFY AND SUMMARIZE
KEEPING YOUR CHARACTERS IN SOCIAL SETTINGS Dialogue can only keep the story moving when you put more than one character in a scene. When you isolate your characters, there’s no one for them to talk to. There’s no dialogue. Of course, there is no way to get around putting your characters in scenes by themselves once in a while. But if an isolated character scene goes on too long, the story starts to dry up. This seems to be a problem with many mainstream and literary stories; the protagonist is too often alone in scene after scene, engaged in selfanalysis. The reader will hang in there for a while, but rambling selfanalysis slows the story way down, and if it goes on too long, you risk losing the reader. So, when thinking through the scenes you want to create, remember that, for the most part, your reader most enjoys those scenes where two or more characters are engaged in some degree of dialogue and action. A scene of dialogue must always move the story forward in some way. No exceptions. If you ever find yourself creating dialogue that fails in this purpose, you’ll just have to throw it out later, no matter how creative, clever, funny, or brilliant. GLORIA KEMPTON is the author of ten books, including Write Great Fiction: Dialogue (Writer’s Digest Books, 2004) and The Outlaw’s Journey: A Mythological Approach to Storytelling for Writers Behind Bars (Third Place Press, 2013).

## CHAPTER 11: USING PROFANITY AND OTHER RAW TALK IN YOUR FICTION by Elizabeth Sims

**Summary and Clarification of "USING PROFANITY AND OTHER RAW TALK IN YOUR FICTION BY ELIZABETH SIMS"**

Elizabeth Sims delves into the topic of using raw language, including profanity, in fiction.

**History and Change Over Time:** 
In 1948, Norman Mailer’s book "The Naked and the Dead" used the term “fug” instead of the more crass f-word due to publisher concerns. The change sparked criticism and led to humorous remarks about the word's censorship. Nowadays, such language has become less shocking, but authors still grapple with how much is appropriate.

**Types of Raw Language:**
1. **Profanity**: Words forbidden by religious doctrine, e.g., taking the Lord’s name in vain.
2. **Curses**: Calling upon harm or damnation, e.g., “Damn this zipper!”
3. **Swears**: To take or proclaim an oath, e.g., “By God, I’ll show you!”
4. **Obscenities**: Morally abhorrent words, often related to sex, e.g., the f-word.
5. **Vulgarism**: Broadly covers crude and objectionable language outside other categories, e.g., “Bitch,” “bastard,” “crap.”

**Usage in Fiction:**
- **Why Use**: Raw language can be realistic, especially when depicting certain environments. It adds authenticity and can help release a character's emotions.
  
- **How to Use**: Use spicy language in moderation for impact. Context matters; e.g., a frustrated comment about eating another doughnut becomes more vivid with the inclusion of a curse. It's essential to capture genuine speech patterns but avoid over-saturating the narrative.

- **How Not to Use**: Rather than relying solely on common curses or profanities, authors can get creative with insults, much like Shakespeare. The aim is to avoid sounding clichéd and instead resonate originality.

Elizabeth advises writers to assess their comfort zones. While it's okay to challenge boundaries, authenticity is vital. Characters need a way to vent emotions verbally. She encourages writers to have fun and be creative with the process rather than using simplistic replacements for swear words.

In essence, the use of raw language in fiction is a tool. Used judiciously and creatively, it can add depth, character, and realism to a narrative.

## CHAPTER 12: THE UHS, ANDS, AND ERS OF DIALOGUE by Gloria Kempton

**Summary & Clarification:**
"The Uhs, Ands, and Ers of Dialogue" by Gloria Kempton emphasizes the significance of speech in character development. The author shares a personal anecdote about a former boyfriend with a lisp, revealing how his speech affected her perception of him. This highlights how something as simple as a character's way of speaking can deeply influence a story's dynamics and a reader's connection to a character.

Most people have standard speech patterns, but some have unique quirks that make them stand out. For instance, in the '80s TV show "The Nanny", the protagonist's distinct nasal voice became a comedic staple. However, it's vital that these speech characteristics don't feel forced or out of place. They should naturally emanate from a character's background, personality, and role within the story.

Kempton asserts that dialogue isn't merely a tool to showcase quirks but is essential in reinforcing the story's overarching theme. Writers face the challenge of conveying these distinct speech patterns authentically in written form. This can be achieved through specific formatting or dialogue tags to guide the reader.

In essence, the way characters speak can have profound implications on story dynamics and reader engagement. Speech quirks should be used judiciously and thoughtfully, ensuring they enhance the character's role and the story's thematic essence.

---

**Summary & Clarification:**

**1. THE TWISTED TONGUE:** 
This category includes characters with speech impediments, like lisping or stuttering. It’s vital to strike a balance; use it sparingly to remind readers but avoid overuse as it can be distracting. Importantly, there should be a meaningful reason behind the character's speech pattern that ties into the story.

**2. THE ROCKET:** 
This is a character who speaks rapidly, either by talking fast or merging words. While representing this can be challenging, it’s recommended to introduce the trait clearly initially and then occasionally reference it later to prevent reader annoyance. The underlying reason for this rapid speech can vary, but it often mirrors the character's overall personality or demeanor.

**3. THE TURTLE:** 
In contrast to "The Rocket," "The Turtle" speaks slowly and deliberately. To effectively convey this speech pattern, writers can use ellipses or other creative means. Additionally, the narrative can incorporate descriptions of the character’s mannerisms to further illustrate their measured pace.

**4. THE BABY DOLL:** 
This character speaks in a high-pitched, childlike tone, indicating a certain naivety or immaturity despite their age. This speech pattern might be rare, especially in males, but it has been observed. To represent this, one might use descriptors like "squeak" or "giggle" and other creative methods to communicate the unique voice.

**5. THE BASS DRUM:** 
This character's voice is hollow and deep, reminiscent of being inside a bass drum chamber. To illustrate this voice to readers, writers may need to describe it using narrative or comparisons to well-known figures, like Tom Brokaw.

**6. THE CALCULATOR:** 
This character speaks very deliberately, often pausing to weigh each word before speaking. The carefulness can be due to multiple reasons – concern for self-image, a desire for manipulation, or fear of saying something that could be harmful. To effectively convey this, writers can use thoughtful pauses and deliberate word choices in dialogue.

**7. THE ACE:** 
This character speaks very little and when they do, their responses are often curt or reduced to single words. While their speech can help in characterization, it's essential to also use other elements like attire, actions, and general demeanor for a fuller representation.

**8. THE APOLOGIZER:** 
This character is constantly apologizing, suggesting a deep-seated feeling of shame or a desire to remain unnoticed. Dialogue for such characters would frequently include "I'm sorry" and might be delivered in softer tones or even mumbling. A smaller font or quiet narrative descriptors can be creatively used to communicate their meekness.

**9. THE SHIELD:** 
This character is perpetually on the defensive, always feeling attacked or threatened. Their speech is characterized by swift responses, an anticipatory tone, and a tendency to change subjects or deflect. They might often seem on edge, constantly trying to anticipate and deflect any potential verbal "blows."

**10. THE CHANNEL CHANGER:** 
This character speaks in disjointed sentence fragments, hopping from one topic to another. Their conversations seem scattered and they might have underlying reasons, like mental illness, intoxication, or trauma. They’re marked by their unpredictable dialogue shifts. This character can disrupt the flow of conversations and add unexpected twists, keeping other characters off-balance.

**11. THE DIALECT:** 
Using dialect in character speech can be challenging because excessive dialect can make reading difficult. Occasionally, writers succeed, like Alice Walker with "The Color Purple." The recommended approach is to sprinkle bits of dialect, ensuring it doesn’t overshadow the narrative. For authenticity, occasionally changing the spelling of words can indicate a character's background without being too distracting.

**12. THE CANNON:** 
This character speaks loudly, and in the case of John Irving’s "A Prayer for Owen Meany," the loudness is indicated with all caps. This style emphasizes the volume without hampering readability, effectively characterizing the individual and making them instantly recognizable.

**13. THE SWITCHBLADE:** 
This character has a tough demeanor, both in physical actions and dialogue. Their speech is assertive, often issuing directives. Sometimes, their toughness is indirect, using nonresponsive dialogue as a scene-building device. Their dialogue often exudes dominance and the need to be in charge.

The overarching idea is that speech patterns are crucial in distinguishing characters and deepening characterization. They can offer readers insights into a character's background, motivations, or state of mind. It's vital for writers to use these speech patterns creatively, ensuring that they don’t overwhelm or alienate the reader.

The excerpt concludes with a note on the author, **GLORIA KEMPTON**, highlighting her works and her unique course that she offers in correctional facilities and writers' conferences.
# PART IV: PROTAGONISTS
## CHAPTER 13: THE HERO AND THE COMMON MAN by Orson Scott Card

**Summary**:

Historically, stories with a serious tone showcased characters of nobility such as kings, queens, warriors, and heroes, often associated with gods. When tales revolved around ordinary people, they often took a comedic twist, highlighting their mundane and sometimes corrupt characteristics. This perspective held that profound stories could not focus on common individuals.

However, the introduction of the novel, with classics such as Pamela and Robinson Crusoe, shifted this perspective, proving that everyday people can be central figures in compelling narratives. Noted critic, Northrop Frye, proposed a pendulum theory where our preference in fictional heroes alternates between the Realistic and Romantic. Over time, Romantic characters, those extraordinary and magnificent, become clichéd and unbelievable. As a reaction, characters become Realistic, representing ordinary individuals. However, characters too ordinary can become mundane and boring, pushing storytellers back towards creating extraordinary characters.

In modern fiction, there's a blend of these extremes. For example, thrillers often showcase characters in powerful roles while historical romances focus on individuals from exotic eras. However, within these genres, there are stories that strive for realism. A notable example is John LeCarre's spy novels, which highlight spies as ordinary people, contrasting the extravagant James Bond archetype. Another example is John Mortimer’s Rumpole, an ordinary English barrister, but with unique characteristics that make him stand out.

In essence, while storytelling trends may fluctuate between emphasizing the ordinary and the extraordinary, the most compelling characters strike a balance, resonating with readers by being both relatable and fascinating.

---

In literature, characters may initially appear ordinary, but for a story to resonate, they must possess some extraordinary quality. Writers like Stephen R. Donaldson and Megan Lindholm have showcased seemingly regular characters, such as a leper or a Vietnam veteran, who are revealed to possess unique and compelling attributes. Stephen King, a prominent horror writer, often depicts characters from the American middle class, yet these characters undergo experiences that are far from typical. The essence is that readers want to identify with a character, but they also crave something remarkable about them. 

Stories aren't just to mimic reality but to elevate experiences, allowing readers to immerse themselves into the character's world. They provide readers with new experiences or deeper insights into familiar ones. In the narrative, the hero acts as a guiding figure, helping the reader discern meaning and values in life. Even in genres priding themselves on extreme realism, such as academic/literary fiction, characters, despite appearing ordinary, always have something extraordinary about them. For instance, Arthur Miller's Willy Loman from "Death of a Salesman" was initially presented as a non-hero. However, as the story unfolds, Loman's aspirations for greatness and the profound despair that follows reveal him as a Romantic hero. The narrative illustrates that even in their failures, characters can exemplify extraordinary attributes or quests, such as Loman's noble search for his version of the "Holy Grail".

Writers from the Realistic tradition, such as Updike, Bellow, and Fowles, craft their characters with heroic dimensions, albeit in a subdued and intricate manner. For example, Humboldt from Bellow’s novel, "Humboldt’s Gift," evolves from an ordinary individual to a hero towards the novel's end.

Without elements that invoke admiration, respect, or awe in a hero, a story might lose its appeal. Writers often face the challenge of striking a balance between making characters relatable and larger-than-life.

The recent trend in academic/literary circles has been to create "aesthetic distance," focusing more on the craft of the narrative rather than the hero's character. This shift moves the audience's admiration from the character to the prowess of the author.

However, the core of storytelling remains constant: authors must create characters that evoke admiration and connection from readers.

Using the character Pete as an example, the narrative demonstrates the challenges authors face. Pete is ordinary, facing regular work challenges. Yet, his extraordinary trait is his empathy towards a problematic colleague, Nora, even when it’s detrimental to him. This action, though it comes with repercussions, reveals Pete’s unique character. Pete's mix of ordinary experiences with an uncommon empathy makes him a hero in a nuanced manner.

In conclusion, for a story to resonate, it is essential to identify and amplify what is "larger than life" in characters. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer, striking a balance between ordinary and extraordinary traits can make a character stand out and resonate with readers.

## CHAPTER 14: FROM ZERO TO HERO by Dawn Wilson
**Summary:**

Dawn Wilson emphasizes the importance of creating relatable and balanced protagonists in writing. She shared a personal anecdote where her friend critiqued her novel's main character as being overly pathetic. This made her realize the necessity of creating well-rounded characters. Wilson offers several tips for writers:

1. **Identify with the Protagonist and Eliminate Extremes**: Characters should have a mix of good and bad qualities. For instance, even though Heathcliff from "Wuthering Heights" has many flaws, he still has redeemable qualities that make readers empathize with him. Giving heroes traits that readers can connect with can make them more engaging.
  
2. **Avoid Associating Negative Personal Experiences with Your Character**: Personal experiences can unintentionally shape our characters. For instance, a negative association with a name from one's past can lead to an aversion to writing a character with that name.

3. **Engage in Imagined Dialogues with Your Character**: Visualizing conversations with your character can help flesh out their personalities and make them more three-dimensional.

4. **Seek Honest Feedback**: It's crucial to get feedback from genuine friends or writing groups. They can provide honest critiques that can help fine-tune your characters.

The overarching message is to strike a balance in character development. While characters don't need to be entirely likable, introducing relatable human traits can make them more palatable to readers.
## CHAPTER 15: HOW TO CHALLENGE YOUR PROTAGONIST by Larry Brooks
**SUMMARY:**

***How to Challenge Your Protagonist by Larry Brooks***

1. **Plot and Character Interdependence**:
   - Plot provides the setting for character development, producing dramatic tension that is paced and eventually resolved.
   - Characters bring relevance and meaning to the plot, creating empathy and allowing readers to vicariously experience the story.
   - The goal is to harmonize plot and character without focusing too much on just one.

2. **Complex Characterization**:
   - Characters become more engaging when they are active rather than passive or introspective.
   - Inner dialogues depict conversations characters have with their most intimate, hidden thoughts. These thoughts often contradict external behaviors.
   - The difference between one's inner thoughts and external behavior creates an underlying tension.
   - Recognizing this internal conflict in characters makes them more authentic and relatable.
   - Writers should incorporate this internal tension in stories for both heroes and villains, making them more intricate and evoking empathy from readers.

3. **The Magic Pill of Compelling Characterization**:
   - Recognizing the inner lives of characters and how it contrasts with their external actions can elevate a writer's ability to craft compelling characters.
   - Characterization is not just about backstory but how characters respond in the present moment.
   - Effective characterization offers insights into the character's head, letting readers interpret and connect emotionally with the character.
   - Achieving empathy between the hero and reader is paramount. It ensures readers are invested in the character's journey.

Larry Brooks emphasizes the significance of inner dialogues in creating rich, relatable characters. By juxtaposing these internal conflicts with external actions, writers can craft intricate narratives and ensure readers connect deeply with their stories.
## CHAPTER 16: RELATE TO READERS WITH A LEAD CHARACTER by James Scott Bell
**Summary & Key Points: Relating to Readers with a Lead Character by James Scott Bell**

**Background:**
- James Scott Bell initially struggled with creating deep, relatable characters in his fiction.
- He came across Lajos Egri's advice: understanding oneself deeply can lead to the creation of complex characters because all humans experience a vast range of emotions.

**How to Create an Emotional Bond with the Reader:**
1. **Identification**: 
   - Readers should feel the story is happening to them.
   - Realism in character emotions and reactions enhance relatability.
   - Example: Stephen King's "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" features Trisha McFarland, a young girl who gets lost, reflecting human flaws.

2. **Sympathy**: 
   - Deepens the reader’s connection with the lead.
   - Methods to induce sympathy include:
     1. **Jeopardy**: Lead faces immediate danger (physical or emotional).
     2. **Hardship**: Characters facing challenges not of their own making.
     3. **Underdog**: Characters up against significant odds.
     4. **Vulnerability**: Characters who are at constant risk.

3. **Likability**: 
   - Characters should perform acts or possess qualities that readers find endearing.
   - Being witty, caring, and selfless makes a character likable.

4. **Inner Conflict**: 
   - Characters should grapple with their own internal dilemmas or fears.
   - This conflict enhances depth and relatability.

**Presenting the Story World:**
- Not just the physical setting, but also the life and routine of the lead character.
- Sometimes, the story starts with the lead practicing their profession, offering a glimpse into their world.

**Setting the Tone:**
- The book's tone, whether serious or comical, should be evident early on.
- While varying moods can be present, the overall tone should remain consistent.

**Hooking Readers with the First Page:**
- Begin the story immediately; don’t just “warm up”.
- Avoid pitfalls like:
  1. **Excessive Description**: Prolonged descriptions can halt the story's momentum.
  2. **Backward Looks**: Overemphasis on the character's past can stagnate the story.
  3. **No Threat**: Start with a disturbance or challenge.

In essence, for a compelling lead character, authors must delve deep into their own emotional experiences, ensuring that their creations resonate with readers through identification, sympathy, likability, and inner conflict. By carefully setting the story world, maintaining a consistent tone, and immediately drawing readers in, writers can enhance the emotional bond and ensure a captivating narrative.
# PART V: ANTAGONISTS

## CHAPTER 17: CREATING AN ANTI-HERO by Jessica Page Morrell

**Summary & Analysis:**

Act I of a novel sets the foundation for the entire story, ensuring readers are compelled to proceed to Act II. This is achieved by introducing a compelling main character, establishing a connection between the reader and this character, and creating a disruption in the protagonist's world. By the end of Act I, it's essential to hint at or introduce the antagonist, who should ideally be as strong as or even stronger than the protagonist. Moreover, the antagonist should be nuanced, making the narrative more engaging.

*Handling Exposition:*  
Exposition or background information is crucial, but how it's presented can make or break a story. Avoid long, tedious dumps of information, especially in dialogue. Rather than revealing everything upfront, incorporate these tidbits creatively. Here are some rules to follow:
1. **Act first, explain later.** Begin with active scenes, gradually weaving in background details.
2. **The Iceberg Rule.** Show just a fraction of a character's backstory or current situation, reserving the bulk for later reveals.
3. **Embed information in confrontation.** Intense scenes or conflicts are ideal settings to drop essential information.

*Examples of Effective Beginnings:*  
1. *Midnight* by Dean Koontz offers a gripping start with a character jogging at night, seamlessly blending exposition with action and setting.
2. *Final Seconds* by John Lutz and David August has a gripping opening sequence spread across several chapters, with intense events pushing the plot forward.

*Great Openings from Best-selling Novels:*  
- Dean Koontz's *Sole Survivor* draws readers in with a haunting and beautifully written opening.
- Stephen King's *The Stand* starts with dialogue, implying immediate motion and tension.
- Literary novels like Herman Melville's *Moby Dick* and Janet Fitch's *White Oleander* focus on intriguing, unique voices and compelling setups. The key is to blend description, character involvement, and an incentive for readers to continue.

In essence, the beginning of a novel must compel, intrigue, and draw readers in, setting the tone for the rest of the story.

**Characteristics of an Anti-Hero**:
- **Definition**: An anti-hero is a character that, despite their flaws or immoral actions, garners sympathy or support from the reader or viewer.
- **Complexity**: They blur the lines between good and evil, often endangering both themselves and others.
- **Compartmentalization**: They might carry out a grim task but can switch quickly to a lighter mood or environment.
- **Character Arc**: Understanding their journey is vital to understanding their role. They may either unintentionally display good behavior or genuinely change due to the story’s events.
- **Background**: Their past usually informs their present behavior, providing justification for their lawlessness or other negative traits.
- **Human Nature Reflection**: Their actions and attributes often provide deeper insights into humanity's flaws.
- **Traits**:
  - Not role models, but we admire their confidence or power.
  - They can show both good and bad behaviors, driven by complex motives.
  - They have boundaries that separate them from pure villains.
  - Their motivations can be diverse, from revenge to honor.
  - They might ally with both good and evil characters.
  - They might help vulnerable characters, either due to coercion or willingly.
  - They might embody unfavorable traits, such as prejudice or violence.
  - They often lack remorse.
  - They're a bundle of contradictions.

**Heroes vs. Anti-Heroes**:
- **Traditional Heroes**:
  - Represent good and triumph over challenges.
  - Initially had divine or superhuman elements (e.g., Hercules).
  - Now represent exceptional humans who overcome obstacles, sometimes sacrificing for a cause.
  - Exhibit moral and virtuous traits.
  - They have flaws, but part of their journey is overcoming these flaws to inspire readers.
  - They are designed to learn and grow, eventually triumphing over adversaries.
  - Heroes are not 100% perfect; they are multi-dimensional and complex.

- **Anti-Heroes**:
  - They have the lead role but are morally ambiguous.
  - They challenge our notions of traditional heroism.
  - Though they may have questionable morals, readers or viewers still sympathize with them.

In essence, while traditional heroes are paragons of virtue who inspire, anti-heroes are more reflective of the human condition's grey areas, challenging our understanding of right and wrong.

**Summary & Clarification on Roles of Anti-Heroes in Contemporary Fiction:**

**1. Everyman:** 
- **Description:** This character is the typical, ordinary person devoid of any exceptional skills or looks. He's someone readers can relate to due to his mundane nature and characteristics such as a beer belly or bald spot. The Everyman is pulled into events, often unwillingly, and reacts in ways that are realistic and genuine.
- **Examples:** Rabbit Angstrom in “Rabbit, Run” and Frank Bascombe in novels like “The Sportswriter.”

**2. Vigilante or Tarnished Knight:** 
- **Description:** A character with a personal moral code who often operates outside the law. These individuals may have once been part of an established system (like the police) but left due to disagreements or mistakes.
- **Examples:** Dirty Harry Callahan and Dan “Doc” Holiday in “The Night Gardener.”

**3. Charming Criminal:** 
- **Description:** This type of anti-hero is a rogue, engaging in illegal activities but remains likable. They're typically involved in heists or scams, often with a touch of wit and charm.
- **Examples:** John Robie in “To Catch a Thief” and Red in Stephen King’s “Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.”

**4. Dark Hero (Byronic Hero):** 
- **Description:** These are brooding, misunderstood loners. They often have a history of pain, making them complex and sometimes unpredictable.
- **Examples:** Jim Stark in “Rebel Without a Cause” and Ellen Ripley in “Aliens.”

**5. Bad Boy:** 
- **Description:** They are rebellious and challenge traditional morality. These characters bring intensity, defiance, and a sense of danger to a story.
- **Examples:** Lestat de Lioncourt in Anne Rice’s novels and Paul Newman's roles in “Cool Hand Luke” and “The Hustler.”

**6. Reluctant Hero:** 
- **Description:** This character is an ordinary or tarnished individual, hesitant to be a part of the main events. Over the course of the story, they may rise to the occasion, even if they doubt their heroism.
- **Examples:** Han Solo in the “Star Wars” series and Ezekiel “Easy” Rawlins in the “Easy Rawlins” series.

**7. Loser:** Characters that often start in a downtrodden position in life, marked by ineptness, flaws, and ill luck. They keep the story on the brink of disaster. Examples include Quoyle from *The Shipping News* and Willie Loman from *Death of a Salesman*.

**8. Outcast:** Characters who stand apart from society, often intentionally. Their existence critiques societal norms and conventions. Captain John Yossarian from *Catch-22* and Huck Finn from Mark Twain's novel are instances.

**9. Screwball:** These characters are unpredictable and often find themselves in complex situations filled with humor and absurdity. Joan Wilder from *Romancing the Stone* and Stephanie Plum in Janet Evanovich’s series are notable examples.

**10. Disgraced Hero:** Once considered heroic but now tainted by personal mistakes or traumas, they struggle with past demons and self-destructive behaviors. Robert B. Parker’s Jesse Stone is an archetype of this character.

**11. Oddball:** Characters that are unique and often ostracized due to their quirks, generating both tension and sympathy in the story. Dean Koontz’s character, Odd Thomas, and characters like Leo Gursky and Alma Singer from *The History of Love* are instances.

**12. Rebel:** These characters challenge and resist the status quo. They can either succeed or tragically fail in their pursuits. Their actions and beliefs often critique societal norms. Randall McMurphy from *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest* is a classic tragic rebel.

In essence, these types of anti-heroes offer varied perspectives that challenge societal norms, generate sympathy or critique, and add complexity to the stories they inhabit.

---
**Summary:**

Anti-heroes are fictional characters who display a blend of opposing traits, making them paradoxical and, thus, more relatable and intriguing to readers. This complexity mirrors real-life individuals, who can be unpredictable, multifaceted, and undergo various moods and transformations due to life events. For instance, Mario Puzo's iconic character, Don Vito Corleone from "The Godfather", exemplifies this blend. Though he's a ruthless criminal, he's also depicted as a caring family man and a sentimental father. Such contradictory traits – like being both pro-family and anti-social, compassionate yet deadly, and appearing benevolent while being a tyrant – make Corleone an enduring character in American fiction. Crafting characters with a balance of positive and negative traits creates a multi-dimensional persona that captivates readers.

| **Negative Trait**                  | **Positive Trait**                                 |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Controlling                        | Efficient, great managerial abilities              |
| Hot-tempered                       | Passionate                                         |
| Manipulating                       | Able to see the big picture                        |
| Overbearing                        | Charismatic                                        |
| Scheming                           | Capable, competent                                 |
| Selfish                            | Focused                                            |
| Greedy                             | Generous to family, works hard to provide comforts |
| Ruthless                           | Ambitious, tender with children and elderly mother |
| Dishonest in business dealings     | Honest with wife, children                         |
| Intolerant, insensitive            | Perceptive                                         |
| Brusque                            | Forceful, decisive                                 |

**Summary:**

When crafting an anti-hero, it's essential to balance traditionally positive traits (e.g., courage, truthfulness) with negative ones (e.g., ruthlessness, aloofness). Their actions and thoughts in different situations should manifest these traits. An interesting twist is when a character's central traits, whether positive or negative, lead to their downfall. For instance, Corleone's confidence and power led his enemies to target him. It's also crucial to ensure the character's traits have consequences; a short temper might strain familial relations, while over-reliance on logic might cost personal connections.

An anti-hero can originate from any walk of life, be it mundane or exceptional. While these characters are inherently complex, it's essential not to make them too hard to empathize with or understand. An anti-hero differs from a villain in that they can undergo positive transformations or even become heroic by the end of the story. The central idea is that an anti-hero is essentially the opposite of the perfect, ultra-competent hero.
## CHAPTER 18: THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL VILLAIN by Donald Maass

**Summary:**

Donald Maass discusses the frequent missteps authors make in crafting villains, often rendering them one-dimensional or overly simplistic. These cardboard villains, purely evil with seemingly endless resources and without obstacles, come off as unrealistic and less engaging. An effective villain doesn't necessarily need to be a classic evil-doer, especially in genres that don't traditionally feature a direct antagonist. Instead, they can be nuanced individuals who, while opposing the protagonist, may sometimes act with good intentions.

Using the works of Keith Ablow and Charles Baxter as examples, Maass showcases villains who are intriguing because of their internal contradictions. For instance, Ablow's villain, West Crosse, is both a talented architect and a sinister killer. This duality, especially when paired with other unique character traits, makes him more captivating.

In John Burnham Schwartz’s "Reservation Road", the antagonism is less clear-cut, focusing instead on two individuals with conflicting motives that readers can empathize with. This approach allows for a more realistic and layered conflict where readers can understand, if not agree with, both sides.

Maass concludes by emphasizing the importance of creating multifaceted villains that can captivate readers, potentially even swaying their sympathies. He acknowledges that authors have the choice to present clear values, but encourages them to invest in developing three-dimensional antagonists.
## CHAPTER 19: AMP UP YOUR ANTAGONISTS by Laura DiSilverio

**Summary:**

In "Amp Up Your Antagonists" by Laura DiSilverio, the author emphasizes the importance of well-developed antagonists in literature. DiSilverio begins with a fictitious email from a slighted antagonist named Eva N. Carnate, expressing discontent with the neglect and underdevelopment she experiences in the hands of authors. The email suggests that when antagonists are not fully developed, the story loses tension, depth, and is easily forgotten. DiSilverio acknowledges that many writers give lesser importance to their antagonists compared to protagonists. 

However, she argues that a compelling antagonist is just as vital to a story's success as the protagonist. An antagonist isn’t just an embodiment of evil but is a sentient being or creation that opposes the protagonist’s goals. This opposition is what creates conflict and allows the protagonist to grow and change. Without a strong antagonist, the story lacks depth and the protagonist's journey becomes uneventful. The author offers writers tips and advice on how to effectively create or enhance their antagonists to make their stories more engaging and memorable. She argues that with the right focus, even the most basic villains can be elevated to the ranks of iconic antagonists like Professor Moriarty and Nurse Ratched.

---

**Summary:**

In this instructional piece, the author offers writers several strategies for crafting compelling and multidimensional antagonists in their stories:

1. **Humanize Antagonists**: Villains should have depth and relatability. Writers should avoid using antagonists as mere plot devices. Offer an origin story, show their vulnerabilities, and even moments of kindness. Examples include the complexity of HAL in "2001: A Space Odyssey" or Shere Khan in "The Jungle Book".

2. **Avoid Pure Evil**: Characters that are purely evil often become unbelievable or caricatures. Instead, show different sides of them. Remember that no one sees themselves as the villain in their own story. Using George R.R. Martin’s "A Song of Ice and Fire" series as an example, the narrative showcases how perspective can change perceptions about characters.

3. **Concrete Antagonists Over Abstract**: Rather than having abstract concepts as the enemy (e.g., "corporate greed"), personify them with human characters to create relatability and direct conflict. 

4. **Balance in Power**: Ensure that the protagonist and antagonist are well-matched. If there's a significant power imbalance, the story becomes predictable and lacks tension.

5. **Intimate Antagonists**: Sometimes, the antagonist might be someone close to the protagonist, like a family member. This creates a dynamic where the protagonist doesn't want to harm the antagonist but wants to change their mind or perspective.

6. **Use Proxies**: Instead of a direct confrontation between the protagonist and the main antagonist, use proxies or underlings to create layers of conflict. An example of this is in the "Harry Potter" series, where Harry faces numerous challenges before confronting the primary antagonist, Voldemort.

The overarching message is to ensure that antagonists are well-rounded and possess depth, enabling a richer, more tension-filled narrative. Respecting and investing in the antagonist character can significantly improve the quality of a story and its reception by readers.

## CHAPTER 20: SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL by Jessica Page Morrell

**Summary:**

"Sympathy for the Devil" by Jessica Page Morrell discusses the importance of creating multi-dimensional, believable antagonists and villains in fiction. Rather than portraying villains as one-dimensional embodiments of evil, Morrell suggests that they should have human qualities, desires, and backgrounds that readers can recognize and understand. This does not mean that a villain becomes any less menacing or that their intentions are justified; instead, it makes them more relatable and intriguing.

In the context of the chapter, sympathy does not necessarily mean likeability but refers to the recognition of the villain's basic human attributes. It's different from empathy, where readers feel emotionally connected to a character's experiences. While protagonists often evoke empathy, villains should evoke sympathy.

Creating a memorable villain involves understanding their deep-rooted motivations, desires, and past traumas. While some villains might be inherently evil, others become villains due to circumstances. This backstory enriches the character and makes them more relatable, even if their actions are abhorrent.

The chapter also emphasizes the interconnectedness of plot and characters. For writers, understanding their characters, especially their main characters, can shape the narrative. It's important to first determine key traits of the protagonist and antagonist, including whether the villain will be sympathetic (multi-dimensional) or unsympathetic (one-dimensional).

In essence, the chapter argues for a deeper exploration into the psyches of villains to create a more compelling and believable narrative. A well-crafted villain, with humanizing traits and a backstory, makes for a more immersive reading experience, making the story resonate more with the audience.
### FIRST COMES KNOWLEDGE

**Summary:**

The text emphasizes the importance of depth, nuance, and a profound understanding of the human psyche when crafting characters in fiction, especially antagonists. Many novice writers fall into the trap of creating one-dimensional caricatures, particularly when it comes to villains. To avoid this pitfall, writers are encouraged to dive into research, specifically into areas of human psychology, mental illness, and criminal behavior. Watching crime shows is not enough; in-depth study is vital.

In real life, humans often classify people into simple categories based on a few actions or behaviors. However, this practice can be detrimental in fiction. Characters should be multifaceted, embodying both good and bad traits, which makes them more realistic and relatable. Generalizations can lead to shallow character development. It's essential to remember that even good people have flaws, and these imperfections can lead to dramatic moments in a story.

Today's readers are well-informed due to the plethora of information available, especially about human behavior and psychology. They're familiar with why people act in certain ways, thanks to TV shows, books, and talk radio. As such, fiction writers need to rise to the challenge, creating villains with depth and substance, not just mere types. This demands a deep understanding of the motives behind a character's actions, whether they stem from human weakness, mental conditions, or personal beliefs.

The text also references Alfred Hitchcock's belief in the importance of a well-crafted villain, using his films as an example of villains with depth and complexity. Like Hitchcock, the writer underscores that the more time spent on a character, the more intricate they must be. Citing contemporary examples like John Malkovich's character Mitch Leary in "In the Line of Fire," the text illustrates the power of a well-developed antagonist, urging writers to craft characters that evoke both intellect and emotion in readers.

### INTAMACY: SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY

**Summary:**

The article underscores the significance of intimate knowledge in character development, specifically in the portrayal of villains or antagonists. In real life, we gain a deep understanding of people when we share intimate spaces and moments with them, like living with them or sharing a bed. This familiarity goes beyond superficial interactions and delves into understanding their vulnerabilities, habits, and quirks. For example, knowing how someone behaves just after waking up or how they deal with nightmares offers profound insight into their character.

When creating characters, especially villains, writers should aim to achieve this level of depth. A villain who seems ordinary but possesses the potential to inflict harm is more terrifying than a stereotypical, over-the-top antagonist. By understanding the intricacies of their daily lives and mannerisms, like how they might react at a cocktail party or their frustrations in everyday situations, a writer humanizes these characters, making them more realistic and relatable.

To create authentic characters, a writer should be aware of their small habits, preferences, routines, and personal challenges. It's essential to imagine the villain under different circumstances, especially when they're not in control, as it adds depth and layers to their character. An essential aspect to remember is that characters, like real people, must show signs of exhaustion, need for rest, and other vulnerabilities. Keeping these elements in mind will help writers craft credible and multidimensional characters that resonate with readers.

### SHAPING THE BACKSTORY
**Summary:**

The article emphasizes the importance of shaping a villain's backstory to make them not only a formidable adversary but also a multidimensional individual. Just as one would carefully reconstruct a prehistoric skeleton, crafting the villain requires a detailed and intricate approach, taking into account their life experiences, upbringing, and personal traumas.

Key considerations while developing a villain's backstory include:
- Understanding their daily life before the story's events.
- Delving into their family background, assessing whether it was stable or fraught with issues.
- Gauging their social interactions and capacity for intimacy.
- Considering traumatic events, mental health issues, or family secrets that may have impacted their psyche.

Research indicates that individuals from dysfunctional families often replicate patterns of dysfunction in adulthood. Children from such backgrounds frequently internalize destructive messages like not trusting others, not discussing their feelings, and suppressing their emotions. Depending on their role within the family, they may act out or become saviors. 

It's crucial to understand the potential origins of a villain's malice. Genetic factors, untreated disorders, or the influence of negative figures in their life can shape their trajectory towards villainy. Additionally, a pivotal tragic event, like a personal loss or exposure to crime, can redirect them towards a darker path.

However, a well-rounded villain's background doesn't always need to stem from trauma. But often, villains in fiction are shaped by some form of loss or adversity. The degree of their malevolence in the story often correlates with the intensity of their backstory's trauma. 

Ultimately, while the writer might possess extensive knowledge about their characters, they must decide how much of this backstory the reader needs to understand the character's motivations and actions in the narrative. The trauma or adversity faced by a villain not only provides context for their behavior but also adds depth, making them more compelling and relatable.

### SYMPATHY STRAGETIES 

**Summary:**

Creating a sympathetic villain is a nuanced process that goes beyond simply making them likable. For a villain to be sympathetic, it's essential to showcase their potential for change, hinting at their past before they turned evil or revealing traumatic events that influenced them. Here are some strategies to create a more empathetic and believable villain:

1. **Logic in Actions:** Ensure the villain's actions make sense, eliminating the sense of authorial manipulation.
2. **Avoid Forced Coincidences:** Evade contrived scenarios that bring the villain and protagonist together.
3. **Realistic Backstories:** While tragic backstories can explain a villain's path, they shouldn't justify their wrongdoings completely. The backstory should be credible, coupled with the villain's poor choices.
4. **Show Struggle:** A villain should not have it easy; their challenges and conflicts can elicit sympathy from the reader.
5. **Relatability:** If a villain is up against an average person, they should also possess some ordinary traits.
6. **Show Vulnerability:** Depicting moments of vulnerability, anguish, and embarrassment in a villain can make them more relatable.
7. **Consequences:** Most villains should face consequences for their actions, whether it's death or imprisonment.
8. **Present Choices:** Offer the villain chances to choose, even if they make the wrong decisions.
9. **Character Interactions:** Display the villain's interactions, perhaps demonstrating love, kindness, or empathy towards others.
10. **View Them as Real People:** Instead of treating villains merely as characters, think of them as real people with depths and complexities.
11. **Narrative Techniques:** Use varied narrative techniques to delve into a villain's psyche, be it through secondary characters, indirect means, or placing readers in the villain's mind. 

By adopting these strategies and studying other writers' works, authors can craft villains who are not only evil but also sympathetic, adding layers and depth to their stories.

### EMPATHY
**Summary:**

Creating a multi-dimensional villain in fiction involves evoking a range of emotions in the reader, from fear to understanding and sometimes, empathy. The essence is to let readers understand what lies beneath the villain's heinous actions. A classic example is Thomas Harris' portrayal of Francis Dolarhyde in "Red Dragon". While Dolarhyde commits horrifying acts, Harris reveals his traumatic past, shaped by physical deformities, mockery from peers, a rejecting mother, and a cruel grandmother. This background gives readers a context, making them oscillate between revulsion for his deeds and empathy for his circumstances.

Despite his heinous crimes, moments arise in the narrative that humanize Dolarhyde, such as his relationship with the blind and likable Reba McClane. This relationship challenges Dolarhyde's violent tendencies, bringing forward a battle between his brutal nature and a newfound sense of love. 

Through twists and turns in the story, Harris masterfully elicits conflicting emotions in the reader. While Dolarhyde's actions are never excused, understanding his backstory makes readers reflect on the tragic trajectory of his life. In crafting villains, authors aim to immerse readers deeply, not only in the protagonist's journey but also in understanding the complexities and inner workings of the antagonist. A well-crafted villain allows readers to explore the psyche of someone vastly different, thus enriching their reading experience.


# PART VI: SUPPORTING CHARACTERS

## CHAPTER 21: DEVELOPING YOUR SUPPORTING CAST by Joseph Bates
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Title:** *Developing Your Supporting Cast* by Joseph Bates

**Main Ideas:** 

1. **Role of Supporting Characters:** They deepen our understanding of the main character and the situation they're in. Supporting characters should not just exist for the sake of existing; they must have purpose and contribute to the story.

2. **Character Traits:** Even characters who appear briefly should be distinct, with unique personalities, motivations, and desires. They should be portrayed as independent individuals, not just plot tools.

3. **Use Case Example:** A man and woman on an uncomfortable dinner date are showcased. A waitress, with her own distinct personality and intentions, can amplify the main characters’ tension and add depth to the scene.

4. **Rounding Flat Characters:** 
    - Characters should have both internal and external motivations.
    - They should have distinctive traits that make them memorable.
    - Characters shouldn’t be one-dimensional. Even villains should have redeeming or multifaceted qualities.

5. **Dealing with Overactive or Inactive Characters:** 
    - If a minor character takes over or doesn’t contribute enough, evaluate their necessity.
    - Authors should be ready to modify or remove characters if they aren't serving the story's purpose.
    - Minor characters should have a clear reason to exist and contribute to the main narrative.

**Essentially,** Bates emphasizes that every character, no matter how minor, should serve a specific purpose in a novel. These characters should be well-rounded with their own motivations and desires to enrich the story's narrative and provide depth to the main characters. The author should be wary of characters that detract from the story or don't add value, and be prepared to make necessary adjustments.
## CHAPTER 22: THE CHARACTER HIERARCHY by Orson Scott Card
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Title:** *The Character Hierarchy* by Orson Scott Card

**Main Ideas:** 

1. **Hierarchy of Characters:** Characters play different roles in a story based on their importance. Not every character holds the same weight in a narrative.

2. **Three Levels of Importance:** 
   
   - **Walk-ons and Placeholders:** These characters are simply background figures. They add realism to the story by being present in a scene but aren't developed in depth. Their primary purpose is to execute a basic function and then fade away.

   - **Minor Characters:** While these characters might influence the plot to some extent, readers aren't expected to form a strong emotional connection with them. They may drive certain events in the story but do not significantly shape its overall trajectory. Typically, they have one or two moments of relevance and then drift into the background.

   - **Major Characters:** These are central to the story. Readers develop a strong emotional connection with them, whether positive or negative. Their desires, decisions, and actions are pivotal to the narrative. They appear frequently, and the story’s outcome largely hinges on their fates.

3. **Blurred Boundaries:** The distinction between these categories is not always clear-cut. A character's importance can lie on a spectrum, and the roles can blend. For instance, while Pete and Nora might be the primary characters, others like Morry, Dolores, and Edgar also hold importance but to varying degrees.

**In essence,** Orson Scott Card discusses the varying degrees of importance characters can have in a story. Recognizing and leveraging this hierarchy is crucial for authors to guide readers on whom to focus on and emotionally invest in. While the categories provide a general guideline, the boundaries between them can be fluid, allowing for characters to take on different levels of prominence as the story progresses.
### WALK-ONS AND PLACEHOLDERS
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Title:** *Walk-ons and Placeholders*

**Main Ideas:**

1. **Presence of Background Characters:** In most stories, the main characters interact with numerous unimportant individuals who are merely part of the setting. Examples include a cab driver, a hotel desk clerk, or a police officer who appear momentarily to serve a specific function and then exit the narrative.

2. **Making Characters Vanish:** Much like in theater, authors can make characters blend into the background. Stage directors ensure walk-ons (minor roles) do not distract from the primary action. They achieve this by:
   - Dressing them similarly or drably.
   - Restricting unnecessary movement or noise.
   - Ensuring they remain focused on their task or the main action.
   - Limiting their time in focus.

3. **Managing Distracting Walk-ons:** In theater, if a minor character becomes a distraction, they are either removed or their role is enhanced. The same applies to fiction. If an inconsequential character starts taking undue attention, the author either cuts them or revises the story to give the character more significance.

4. **Stereotyping for Disappearance:** Stereotypes can be useful in fiction for background characters. A stereotyped character behaves exactly as readers expect, making them blend into the background. While stereotypes can be problematic in real life (often being unfair or biased), in fiction, they can help streamline the narrative. When writers deliberately break stereotypes, the character becomes more noticeable and no longer remains a mere walk-on.

**In essence,** the piece discusses the concept of "walk-ons" or placeholder characters in storytelling. These characters, present in the background, are designed to provide realism without diverting attention from the central characters or plot. The author suggests techniques to manage these characters effectively, noting the potential of stereotypes to help these characters blend into the narrative seamlessly. However, breaking away from these stereotypes can make such characters stand out and become central to the story.
### MINOR CHARACTERS
**Summary:**

**Minor Characters in Fiction:**

1. **Background Characters & Stereotypes:** Minor characters, unlike main characters, are designed to be part of the background. They can be based on stereotypes, making them recognizable but not distracting. If a background character acts unexpectedly or against the stereotype, it draws attention. If this attention is unintentional, the character either needs to be revised to fit the background or further developed to become a significant part of the story.

2. **Importance of Eccentricity:** An eccentric minor character stands out and becomes memorable without changing the story's direction. An example given is Bronson Pinchot's character in Beverly Hills Cop. Though memorable, the character didn't change the main plot.

3. **Exaggeration & Obsessiveness:** Making a minor character slightly more exaggerated than usual can make them memorable, like Sweet-Face in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Another way to make a minor character stand out is to make them obsessive about something, like the cab driver in the provided example who is fixated on the correct fare.

4. **Placement Matters:** The time spent on a character and their placement in a story determines their perceived importance. If a seemingly minor character takes a significant portion of a short story's beginning, they appear more important than if they occupied a tiny part of a novel.

In essence, while minor characters can be made memorable through techniques like eccentricity, exaggeration, or obsessiveness, their role in the story and placement determines their overall importance. Authors should be careful to ensure the reader's expectations align with the character's intended significance.
### MAJOR CHARACTERS
**Summary:**

The importance of a character in a story depends on a variety of factors. Major characters are those whose decisions and actions are crucial to the progression and outcome of the story. They demand more time and attention in terms of characterization. Some key techniques and cues that make a character significant include:

1. **Choices:** Characters with power and decision-making capabilities stand out.
2. **Focus:** When other characters pay attention to or discuss someone, that person becomes noteworthy. Characters don’t always need to be present to be significant, like Sauron in "The Lord of the Rings."
3. **Frequency of Appearance:** Repeated appearances hint at a character's importance.
4. **Action:** Active characters, those who influence the plot and other characters, are more memorable than passive ones.
5. **Sympathy:** Characters that endear themselves to the audience become essential.
6. **Point of View:** Characters used as narrators or through whose perspective the story is told become more significant.

However, external factors, such as readers’ personal experiences and perceptions, can also influence their view of a character's importance. For a balanced story, writers should be conscious of these techniques to prioritize characters effectively. This ensures that readers understand the hierarchy of characters and the main characters or protagonist truly stand out.

## CHAPTER 23: CRAFTING EFFECTIVE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS by Hallie Ephron
**Summary of Chapter 23: Crafting Effective Supporting Characters by Hallie Ephron**

**Supporting Characters in Classic Fiction:**
Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is surrounded by an array of supporting characters such as Dr. Watson, Mrs. Hudson, Inspector LeStrade, the Baker Street Irregulars, and Mycroft Holmes. These characters offer different aspects of support to the protagonist.

**Balancing Character Traits:**
1. Protagonists often require a sidekick with contrasting traits to highlight their own qualities. Examples include Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, Detective Kathy Mallory and Detective Riker, Spenser and Hawk, and Myron Bolitar and Windsor Horne Lockwood, III.
2. Opposites often attract in literary duos. The differences between the main character and their sidekick emphasize their unique attributes.

**Challenging the Protagonist:**
1. Every main character should have an adversary. This person is not a villain but creates challenges for the protagonist, making their journey more complicated. This could be a coworker, family member, or even a superior officer.
2. Adversaries add depth and conflict to the narrative. Examples include Sherlock Holmes' tense relationship with Inspector LeStrade and Temperance Brennan's frustration with police sergeant Luc Claudel.

**Fleshing Out the Supporting Cast:**
1. Supporting characters could be anyone from the protagonist's life. In series, they can have ongoing storylines.
2. Although they might start as stereotypes, it's essential to develop them into more complex characters as the story unfolds.
3. It's crucial not to let supporting characters overshadow the protagonist.

**Naming Supporting Characters:**
1. Choose memorable names for your supporting cast.
2. Ethnic names, nicknames, and names that differ in length or sound can make characters stand out and be more distinguishable for readers.

**Introducing Minor Characters:**
1. Even characters with minor roles should leave an impression.
2. It's better to define them by their actions or brief dialogue rather than detailed descriptions.

**Authenticity through Walk-on Characters:**
1. Walk-on characters add realism to a novel. They might not play significant roles, but they provide a sense of a lived-in world.
2. They need minimal description and usually don't require names.

**Conclusion:**
Supporting characters play vital roles in highlighting the protagonist's attributes, adding depth to the narrative, and creating a vibrant, believable world. Choosing the right traits, names, and backgrounds for them can enrich the story and engage the reader more deeply.
# PART VII: CONFLICT

## CHAPTER 24: A CHARACTER’S EMOTIONAL THREAD by Jordan E. Rosenfeld

**Summary:**

**Chapter 24: A Character’s Emotional Thread** by Jordan E. Rosenfeld

The chapter underscores the importance of a character's gradual transformation in fiction to ensure authenticity and credibility. Rapid changes in a character's nature might make readers skeptical.

To help writers visualize a character’s transformation, the narrative can be divided into three parts or acts. The first act focuses on the foundation of the characters, introducing them, and setting the tone for future conflicts.

**Key Points in the Early Scenes:**

1. **Establishing Characters and Their Conflicts:** In the beginning, characters should be introduced clearly, making their roles, problems, and relationships evident to the readers.

2. **Involvement:** The protagonist’s relationship to the main events or conflicts should be clear. Whether they accidentally stumbled into it, are integral to it, or caused it.

3. **The Stakes:** Clearly establish what the protagonist stands to lose or gain from the events. This builds tension and drama.

4. **Desires:** What the protagonist wants, from material objects to emotional needs, should be evident. This gives depth to their intentions and actions.

5. **Fears:** The protagonist’s fears, whether rational or irrational, should be established early on as they can influence their actions.

6. **Motivation:** The protagonist's motivations, influenced by their desires and fears, drive their actions. It should be clear why they act in a certain way.

7. **Challenges:** These are the hurdles or situations that oppose the protagonist's desires and evoke their fears. They are essential for building conflict and narrative tension.

The chapter provides an analysis of these elements using early scenes from the novel "House of Sand and Fog" by Andre Dubus III, focusing on the character Kathy. Through her experiences, the reader can see the implications of involvement, stakes, desires, fears, motivations, and challenges.

In conclusion, the first part of a narrative should effectively set up potential conflicts, introducing the reader to the character’s world, challenges, desires, and fears. By the end, there should be indications that the protagonist is poised for change, setting the stage for the middle and end of the story.
## CHAPTER 25: PUSH YOUR CHARACTER TO THE LIMITS by David Corbett
**SUMMARY:**

**"PUSH YOUR CHARACTER TO THE LIMITS" BY DAVID CORBETT**

In storytelling, characters occasionally behave in ways that surprise or even baffle the audience. However, this unexpected behavior shouldn't feel inauthentic or unbelievable. Authentic character behavior, even when surprising, should stem from:

1. **Character in Context**: Real-life behaviors that seem out of character often come from unseen pressures or influences. In fiction, it's the writer's job to ensure characters behave consistently yet retain the potential to surprise.

2. **The Three Factors**:
   - **Conflict**: A character reacts unexpectedly due to an immediate opposition or challenge.
   - **Permission**: A character behaves differently due to circumstances that free them from their usual inhibitions or norms.
   - **Deceit/Disclosure**: A character has hidden certain aspects of themselves, which suddenly come to light.

3. **Realism**: Characters stepping out of their usual behavior should exhibit discomfort or lack of skill in their new behavior, rather than mastering it instantly.

4. **The Role of Contradictions**: Humans are naturally contradictory. These contradictions in characters can pique audience interest and add depth. Whether they're behavioral, situational, or internal, contradictions can be tools for suspense and complexity. However, they need to be believable.

5. **Emotion, Intuition, and Trust**: Instead of offering direct explanations for a character's actions, writers should focus on developing characters through emotionally significant scenes. This approach enables audiences to connect with characters intuitively.

In essence, Corbett emphasizes that writers should strive to create characters that behave authentically, even when pushed to their limits, and avoid turning them into mere "plot puppets".
## CHAPTER 26: CHARACTER OBJECTIVE AND CONFLICT by Mary Kole

### OBJECTIVE, MOTIVATION, AND ACTION
**Summary:**

Mary Kole emphasizes the importance of developing well-rounded characters in storytelling. For readers to connect with and care about a character, they need to understand that character's objectives (what they want), motivations (why they want it), and actions (how they go about getting it). These three elements are interconnected.

1. **Objective**: This is a character’s primary goal or desire. It could be an object, person, or an abstract value. While a character may have smaller objectives throughout a story, the overarching objective drives them forward.

2. **Motivation**: Merely stating what a character wants isn’t enough. The reader needs to understand the reason behind this desire. This motivation often has roots in a character’s backstory or past experiences.

3. **Action**: When a character is motivated by an objective, they take actions to achieve it. Actions are manifestations of their motivations and objectives, and they can change and adapt based on circumstances.

Characters must constantly strive towards their objectives, with their actions reflecting these goals, even if they face setbacks or deviate from their path. Additionally, characters often have unconscious objectives, deeper needs or desires they may not be openly aware of but still influence their behavior. As a writer, it's crucial to understand both the overt and hidden objectives of a character. The reader should be able to sense both the overt objectives and the deeper motivations driving a character, without these motivations being explicitly stated.
### A CHARACTER IN CONFLICT
**Summary:**

Characters are driven by conflict, which can be categorized as internal and external. 

1. **Internal Conflict**: This pertains to the emotional and psychological battles a character experiences. It can be triggered by external events or may reside purely in the character's mind. Examples include feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, unresolved emotional pain, or fear of failure.

2. **External Conflict**: This is divided into:
   - **Interpersonal Conflict**: These are issues between individuals, like disputes with friends or family, challenges at work, or disagreements with peers.
   - **Societal Conflict**: These involve larger-scale problems that a character confronts, such as oppressive governments in a dystopian setting or broader societal issues like pandemics, racism, or economic challenges.

For a story to captivate readers, it needs a balance of both internal and external conflict. It's through these struggles that readers relate to and engage with characters. A narrative requires this tension because a story about a character without challenges or dilemmas is unlikely to hold a reader's interest. Fiction thrives on challenges, friction, and turmoil.
### BALANCING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CONFLICT
**Summary:**

For effective storytelling, writers should balance internal and external conflict, ensuring that the conflict has a purpose and isn't merely inserted for drama. 

1. **Purposeful Conflict**: Conflict in a story should arise from genuine motivations rather than being simply inserted for drama. Random conflict can lead to melodrama which might deter readers.

2. **Internal vs. External Conflict**: While internal conflict (a character's inner struggles) is vital, an entire story built only on this can stagnate. To maintain a dynamic narrative, external conflict involving interaction with other characters and societal issues should also be present.

3. **Revealing Objective**: Understand your character's deep desires. What do they want more than anything, and how do these wants show in their actions? For instance, a character desiring a home might seek comfort with her foster parents.

4. **Revealing Motivation**: Delve into why your character has specific objectives. What drives their desires?

5. **Confronting Changes**: Plan events that challenge your character emotionally, making them navigate internal conflicts. Consider how they react, especially in ways that might surprise the reader.

6. **Confronting Failure**: Understand your character's barriers. Design scenes where they face these obstacles, fail, and then either overcome or come to terms with them.

7. **Me vs. The World**: Identify what your character sees as flawed or wrong in their society. Position your character in situations where they confront these societal challenges, revealing deeper layers of their personality.

In essence, every conflict introduced should offer insights into a character's objectives, motivations, and personality, making the narrative both engaging and layered.
### CREATING CHARACTERIZING DETAILS AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHARACTERS
**Summary:**

Characterizing details are specific and multilayered bits of information or actions that reveal deeper insights into a character beyond mere surface descriptions. They are not just arbitrary traits, but meaningful hints that inform readers about a character's deeper personality, preferences, and values.

**Key Points**:

1. **Characterizing Detail Defined**: It's a piece of information or action that provides a profound understanding of a character's nature. While a protagonist having red hair is just a surface detail, the protagonist eating a dropped cookie after a prolonged period indicates a love for cookies and a certain tolerance for potential dirt or germs.

2. **Purpose of Characterizing Details**: These details enrich the portrayal of characters by revealing deeper layers of their personalities, making them more relatable and realistic. They do more than just describe; they teach readers about who the character truly is.

3. **Delivery through Action**: Most characterizing details are shown through actions rather than being told, making them more memorable.

4. **Specificity and Relatability**: The best characterizing details are both precise and relatable. For example, a character sneaking a glance to ensure no one's watching before eating a dropped cookie is specific, and many readers might find it relatable due to their own similar experiences.

In essence, characterizing details are tools that provide depth and dimension to characters, making them more vivid and authentic in the minds of readers.
### STANDOUT CHARACTERS
**Summary**:

Creating standout characters in fiction doesn't require an overload of details but rather the inclusion of quality, memorable specifics that hint at the character's deeper personality. Instead of overwhelming readers with excessive traits or descriptions, writers should focus on potent characterizing details that resonate and stick in the reader's mind. Such details are often those that writers first conceive for their characters. To add authenticity and depth, writers can also seek inspiration from real people who have experienced situations similar to those of the characters, as interviews can provide rich, unique details that might not be conjured from imagination alone.

**Key Points**:

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: It's not the number of details that makes a character stand out, but the quality and memorability of those details.
  
2. **Effective Characterization**: Instead of bombarding a character with multiple quirks, one distinctive trait, like carrying a 1960s paisley print valise, can evoke a unique personality.

3. **Seek Real Inspiration**: When stuck, writers can benefit from interviewing real people who've been in situations similar to their characters. This brings in authentic and specific details that can enhance the story's believability.

In essence, focusing on a few, impactful details and grounding characters in reality can lead to more vivid and memorable character portrayals in fiction.
### RELATABILITY AND AWARENESS
**Summary**:

Characters in fiction should be relatable, showcasing flaws and quirks that readers can identify with. It's crucial not to overly sanitize characters, as their imperfections make them more human and compelling. A significant aspect to consider in character development is the level of self-awareness a protagonist possesses. Some characters may be acutely aware of their actions and feelings, while others might act impulsively or find their emotions unpredictable. Exploring a character's self-awareness can add depth, making them more realistic and thus enhancing reader connection.

**Key Points**:

1. **Flaws Make Characters Relatable**: Perfect characters can seem inauthentic. It's their imperfections and challenges that readers often connect with.
  
2. **Self-awareness Spectrum**: The degree to which a character is aware of their actions, consequences, and emotions can vary. This range in self-awareness can add layers to their personality.

In essence, for characters to resonate with readers, they should be crafted with genuine human traits, including varying levels of self-awareness and a mix of strengths and vulnerabilities.
### CORE IDENTITY 
**Summary**:

To create a multidimensional protagonist, understanding their core identity is crucial. This goes beyond surface-level characteristics and delves into the essence of who the character truly is. Here's a breakdown of these core attributes:

1. **Core Strength**: The inner resilience that fuels a character to persevere when faced with adversity.
  
2. **Core Virtue**: The highest value or principle that the character cherishes in themselves and others.

3. **Core Role**: An extension of core virtue, it represents the role or responsibility the character places utmost importance on. For instance, if loyalty is the virtue, the role might be that of a trusted friend.

4. **Core Flaw**: Every strength or virtue has a downside. This refers to the negative aspects or the dark side of the character's prime qualities.

5. **Core Emotions**: These are the fundamental feelings that drive a character's decisions, actions, and reactions.

6. **Core Boundaries**: The character's moral compass that determines right from wrong, and the limits they won't cross.

7. **Core Outlook and Fixed Beliefs**: The inherent perspective through which a character views the world, shaped by experiences, upbringing, and personal beliefs. It's their basic understanding of how the world functions.

For writers, even if not all these elements make it into the final draft, knowing these depths allows for richer character development. A character's core identity should be so ingrained that, when challenged, it can lead to compelling plotlines and inner conflict.

### COMPLEX AT THE CORE
**Summary**:

At the heart of compelling storytelling is the complexity of a character's core identity. Every character should have multi-faceted beliefs and principles, and to elevate the narrative, writers should challenge these core values, pushing characters to their limits and placing them in morally ambiguous situations. Such challenges could come in the form of plot twists, secondary characters, or antagonistic forces. These situations make characters reevaluate their beliefs and sometimes act out of character. By exposing inconsistencies in a character's beliefs or actions, readers are drawn deeper into the narrative. When a character's core values are tested and they make surprising decisions, it not only enhances their depth but also captivates readers, making for a richer, more compelling story.
### ACTIVE CHARACTERS ALWAYS WORK
**Summary**:

Characters should be active and dynamic, possessing a defined sense of identity. Passive characters, those lacking motivation or self-awareness, often detract from the story, making events feel shallow regardless of their grandeur or intensity. Here are some tools and exercises for enhancing a character's depth:

1. **Core Identity**: Dive into the details of your character's core strengths, virtues, and challenges. Understand their internal drivers.
  
2. **Heroic Qualities**: Consider how your character might heroically respond to situations. Identify moments they stand up against adversity or for someone else.

3. **Tough Decisions**: Define moments in the plot where characters face difficult decisions. These decisions should challenge and redefine the characters, highlighting their evolution.

4. **Outlying Layer**: Identify contrasting elements within the character's identity, which conflict with their primary values. Use these contradictions to add complexity and introduce unexpected plot twists.

5. **Character Reactions**: Identify and write about instances where events or people challenge or threaten a character's core beliefs. Their reactions will provide insights into their depth and evolution.

6. **Past, Present, and Future**: Use stream-of-consciousness writing from the character's perspective to explore their thoughts and concerns. This exercise helps in understanding what preoccupies them, their past regrets, and future anxieties.

7. **Quirks and Private Moments**: Delve into the intimate moments of a character. Understand their quirks, habits, and actions when they are alone. What do they cherish, fear, or aspire to when unobserved?

In essence, a character's strength isn't just about their outward actions but deeply rooted in their internal struggles, beliefs, and idiosyncrasies. The goal is to create a three-dimensional character that resonates with readers, drawing them further into the story.

## CHAPTER 27: COPING WITH CONFLICT by Rachel Ballon

### EMOTIONS AND CONFLICT
**Summary**:

**Coping with Conflict by Rachel Ballon**

In the chapter titled "Coping with Conflict", Rachel Ballon emphasizes the indispensable role of conflict in crafting engaging stories and deep characters. Without conflict, a story becomes lifeless and characters lack depth, dynamism, and relatability.

Key points:

1. **Importance of Conflict**: Conflict is the heartbeat of every compelling narrative. It drives characters, propelling the plot and revealing the multiple facets of their personas. When characters face conflict, they are forced to show their true selves, removing the masks they wear.

2. **Emotions & Conflict**: Emotional conflict is integral to every story, irrespective of its genre. While external events (wars, disasters, etc.) can bring excitement to the plot, the core of a story lies in the internal emotional conflicts characters face, such as fears or desires.

3. **Developing Emotional Conflict**: To infuse a narrative with emotional conflict, an author should assign a specific goal to the main character and then place obstacles in their path to achieving it. These barriers create the necessary internal and external conflicts. The intensity of the story increases proportionally to the size of the obstacles and complications.

4. **Role of Fear**: Fear is a fundamental emotion that can act as a cornerstone for both internal and external conflicts. For instance, in John D. MacDonald’s "The Executioners", the main character's overwhelming fear of a menacing ex-convict drives the story's tension and showcases the deteriorating emotional state of the protagonist.

5. **Character Motivation**: It's essential to determine what characters are willing to fight for or even sacrifice their lives for. The answers to these questions lay the foundation for powerful emotional conflicts.

6. **Types of Conflict**: While there are various forms of conflict, using a combination of them can enhance the depth, suspense, and emotional richness of characters and the overall narrative.

In conclusion, conflict is the bedrock of engaging storytelling. It adds depth to characters, drives the plot forward, and makes narratives memorable.
### ACTION VS. EMOTIONAL CONFLICT
**Summary**:

**Action vs. Emotional Conflict in Storytelling**

Conflict is a fundamental element in storytelling. While action-packed scenes like wars, battles, and disasters can be gripping, it's the emotional conflict within characters that truly engages and resonates with the audience. Successful stories often intertwine action with deep emotional undertones, drawing readers or viewers into a more intimate connection with the characters.

Key Takeaways:

1. **The Essence of Conflict**: Writing thrives on conflict, which isn't restricted to physical battles or violent confrontations. Emotional conflicts within characters add layers of tension and suspense to a narrative.

2. **Emotion Drives Engagement**: Blockbusters like "The English Patient" or "Gone with the Wind" have showcased that emotional interactions between characters can be more impactful than overarching conflicts like wars. For instance, in "Titanic," the love story of Rose and Jack is what deeply connects the audience to the tragedy, rather than the mere sinking of the ship.

3. **The Pitfall of Overemphasis on Action**: Novels or films that prioritize relentless action without delving into the inner conflicts of their characters often fail to create a lasting impact. Audiences may become desensitized to continuous conflict if they can't form an emotional bond with the characters.

4. **The Power of Emotional Connection**: When readers or viewers are emotionally invested in characters, even simple disagreements between those characters can evoke more powerful reactions than large-scale battles or disasters. It's this emotional attachment that makes stories memorable.

In essence, while action can be thrilling, it's the emotional conflicts within characters that truly capture the hearts and minds of an audience, making stories unforgettable.
### TYPES OF CONFLICT
**Summary**:

**Types of Conflict in Storytelling**

1. **Man Against Himself**:
   - This is the inner battle a person wages against their own desires, weaknesses, or beliefs. It's often related to internal turmoil or personal dilemmas.
   - *Example*: Adam's struggle with cocaine addiction showcases his internal battle between the desire for the drug and the understanding of its destructive nature. In literature, novels like "Requiem for a Dream" and "Bridget Jones’s Diary" portray the protagonist's intense inner conflicts, whether they are drug-related or personal self-worth and acceptance issues.
   
2. **Man Against Nature**:
   - This is about the struggles between a person (or people) and natural forces or animals.
   - *Example*: Adventure films like "Alien," "Jurassic Park," and "Planet of the Apes" show characters pitted against natural or otherworldly elements. A classic literary instance is Hemingway’s "The Old Man and the Sea," where Santiago, the fisherman, engages in a prolonged struggle with a massive marlin.
   
3. **Man Against Man**:
   - This conflict arises when one character's goals are obstructed by another character.
   - *Example*: Such conflicts can be seen in detective stories, war narratives, or tales of personal relationships like "Ordinary People," "American Beauty," and "The Great Santini." While the former might showcase good versus evil battles, the latter delves deeper into emotional and psychological conflicts within families or between friends and lovers.

Overall, for a narrative to be compelling, it often incorporates both internal (emotional) and external conflicts. The most impactful stories, while having external events, focus on the characters' internal struggles, as these tend to resonate more deeply with audiences. Personal tales, such as Tobias Wolff's "This Boy’s Life," underscore the emotional and psychological turmoil of characters, ensuring a lasting impact on readers.
### SOURCES OF CONFLICT
**Summary**:

**Sources of Conflict: Understanding Frustrations in Characters**

Conflict in storytelling is often a result of opposing emotional desires that cause inner turmoil or frustration in characters. Such frustrations arise when characters face challenges preventing them from achieving their goals or avoiding undesirable outcomes.

1. **Types of Frustrations**:
   - **Environmental Frustration**: Stemming from external circumstances, these frustrations can include factors such as financial struggles, societal or parental restrictions, lack of resources (like housing or food), and larger threats like terrorism.
   
   - **Personal Frustration**: These are internal struggles faced by characters due to personal limitations. Examples include mental or physical health issues, inadequate intelligence or physical strength, emotional conflicts, and psychological disturbances.

2. **Root of Conflict**: 
   - At its core, frustration emerges when an individual, whether a real person or a fictional character, feels thwarted or trapped in situations or relationships that seem to have no resolution. This can be observed even in infants, who show aggression or throw tantrums when their needs are unmet.

To craft compelling narratives, writers should bestow their characters with either environmental or personal frustrations, amplifying the story's conflict and depth.
### REACTIONS TO CONFLICT
**Summary**:

**Understanding Reactions to Conflict: Fight, Flight, and Self-Sabotage**

Conflict, a central component of narratives, often leads characters to respond in specific ways due to frustration or stress. Generally, there are two primary responses to conflict:

1. **Fight**: This is an aggressive response to conflict and can manifest:
   - **Directly**: Through physical actions such as brawls, duels, or gunfights.
   - **Indirectly**: Through non-physical means such as verbal abuse, including criticism, sarcasm, blaming, arguing, or threats.

2. **Flight**: This response involves avoiding the source of conflict, either:
   - **Directly**: By physically distancing oneself, like running away, quitting a job, or ending relationships.
   - **Indirectly**: By mentally disengaging or escaping from reality through daydreams, fantasies, detachment, or even extreme measures like suicide. An example of this is James Thurber's "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty", where the protagonist retreats into his fantasies to escape his mundane life.

3. **Self-Sabotage**: A more complex reaction, this involves individuals directing their frustrations inwards. In an attempt to escape emotional pain, they might indulge in reckless behaviors or substance abuse.

For compelling storytelling, authors should explore various patterns of conflict and the nuanced ways characters might react, offering depth and realism to the narrative.
### PATTERNS OF CONFLICT
**Summary**:

**Understanding Patterns of Conflict in Narratives**

1. **Double-Approach Conflicts**: Characters are presented with two positive choices and must decide between them. While neither option might lead to dire consequences, the decision can be difficult if both are equally enticing. *Example*: In "When Harry Met Sally", Harry must choose between commitment (with Sally) and freedom.

2. **Double-Avoidant Conflicts**: These are situations where characters must decide between two negative outcomes. Both choices can have grave repercussions. *Example*: In Anna Quindlen’s "Black and Blue", the protagonist has to decide between staying with an abusive husband or leaving and facing the challenges of a new identity and life without her past connections.

3. **Approach-Avoidant Conflicts**: Here, a seemingly positive decision leads to negative outcomes down the road. Often, this pattern is seen in characters with addictions, where a short-term solution (like alcohol) can cause long-term problems. *Example*: In "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya-Sisterhood", Vivi Walker resorts to alcohol to cope, which leads to strained relationships and personal turmoil.

In essence, stories often revolve around the choices characters make in the face of conflicts. The outcomes of these decisions, whether they lead to resolution or further complications, define the character's journey and drive the narrative forward.
### DEFENSE MECHANISMS
**Summary**:

**Defense Mechanisms: Understanding Psychological Protection**

Defense mechanisms are subconscious strategies individuals use to protect themselves from emotional pain, anxiety, and threats to self-worth. Proposed by Sigmund Freud, these mechanisms are means by which the ego alters our perception of reality, helping maintain emotional equilibrium. People with higher self-esteem are generally better equipped to handle stress, while those with lower self-esteem might employ these defenses more frequently. 

Here's a list of common defense mechanisms:

1. **Compensation**: Overcompensating for perceived shortcomings, like a student striving for perfect grades to bolster self-worth.
 
2. **Conversion**: Transforming emotional pain into physical symptoms, as seen in soldiers experiencing sudden blindness due to traumatic events.

3. **Denial**: Ignoring pressing issues by diverting focus to lesser problems, e.g., a financially struggling individual gambling instead of addressing his debts.

4. **Identification**: Aligning oneself with those in power, like hostages sympathizing with their captors.

5. **Projection**: Seeing one's undesirable traits in others, attributing one's own negative qualities to someone else.

6. **Repression**: Unconsciously blocking painful memories or impulses.

7. **Suppression**: A conscious effort to control unacceptable emotions or desires.

8. **Undoing**: Attempting to counteract guilt with kind acts, like Vivi in the "Ya-Ya Sisterhood" being especially nice to Sidda after a fit of anger.

9. **Sublimation**: Channeling unacceptable feelings into socially acceptable activities, such as volunteering.

10. **Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviors**: Using repetitive actions as coping mechanisms, depicted by Jack Nicholson's character in "As Good As It Gets."

11. **Rationalization**: Providing socially acceptable reasons for behaviors that stem from deeper, unacknowledged motives.

12. **Addictions**: Turning to substances or behaviors to temporarily alleviate anxiety or frustration, which can lead to self-destruction.

In literature, using these defense mechanisms can add depth to characters. For instance, a character might be in denial about a family member's addiction or may use academic achievements to sublimate feelings for someone off-limits.
### PROTECTION FROM CONFLICT
**Summary**:

**Masks of Protection: Uncovering True Character in Life and Fiction**

Every individual, both in reality and fiction, tends to hide behind "masks" - facades they present to the world as a means of self-protection against vulnerability and emotional pain. These masks conceal one's true self, serving as defense mechanisms against potential hurt and judgment. Historically, actors in ancient Greek dramas used physical masks to assume roles, drawing a parallel to the symbolic masks people wear in everyday life. Different masks might be presented in various situations or with distinct individuals, keeping the authentic self concealed and often alienating individuals from their inner emotions and genuine connections with others.

Learning to wear these masks starts early in life, influenced by societal norms, parental guidance, and experiences. Children quickly learn that expressing their true feelings might lead to scolding or mockery. Over time, they become so accustomed to wearing these masks that they lose touch with their inner selves, leading to detachment and a loss of genuine emotional connection.

In literature, the shedding or realization of these masks often drives character development and plot progression. F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" is a notable example where characters, including the titular Jay Gatsby, wear masks of pretense, striving for identities they cannot truly attain. The narrative underscores the tragedy of leading lives behind masks and the ultimate revelation of characters' true identities.

For writers, understanding and acknowledging their own masks is crucial. To create deep, believable characters in fiction, authors must introspect and connect with their genuine selves, transcending their personal masks. Only by doing so can they truly unveil the personas of their characters, offering readers a genuine and profound connection.
### CONFLICTS OR CHOICES
**Summary**:

**The Complexities of Choice and Conflict in Character Development**

Life is punctuated by conflicts and choices. While some are as simple as selecting an outfit or meal, most decisions carry weight. They arise from a matrix of past experiences, values, beliefs, and perceptions. Just as our choices define our life trajectories, characters in fiction are sculpted by their decisions, driven by their backstories and psychologies.

Consider the case study of a single, young stockbroker woman. Outwardly, she's attractive, charming, and seemingly confident. However, despite her ability to attract men, she struggles with maintaining long-term relationships. Every relationship she's had ends with her heartbroken. As she grapples with a new romantic prospect at work, her past experiences with betrayal and pain heavily influence her choices. Although she desires love and connection, a history of hurt has made her wary of new relationships.

Her internal conflict isn't just about choosing to date the new man; it's about confronting her past. The emotional scars from her previous relationships manifest as insecurity, neediness, and mistrust. As she lets these insecurities overpower her, she inadvertently sabotages her new relationship, pushing her lover away with her erratic behavior. This spiraling pattern of mistrust and insecurity leaves her increasingly bitter and skeptical about love.

For writers, this example emphasizes the importance of crafting multi-dimensional characters, shaped by their pasts, who evolve over the story's progression. Just as real people mask their true feelings with diverse facades, fictional characters can present a range of emotions, revealing the intricate dance between external choices and internal conflicts.
# PART VIII: MOTIVATIONS & RELATIONSHIPS 
## CHAPTER 28: MOTIVATION AND REALISM by Cheryl St. John
**Summary**:

**Understanding Motivation in Character Development by Cheryl St. John**

Every action has an underlying motivation. Whether it's as simple as scratching an itch or as complex as wanting a large family due to one's upbringing, the reasons behind actions give depth to characters. Cheryl St. John emphasizes that nothing happens without a cause. Understanding the "why" behind characters' actions is crucial for making them relatable and believable.

A key concept is the "prime motivating factor" or "prime motivation". This refers to a past event or series of events that significantly shape a character's behavior and personality. For instance, Quint from Jaws has his actions influenced by a past traumatic event. Leonard Hofstadter from The Big Bang Theory, shaped by a loveless childhood with an emotionally detached mother, gives us insight into his quirky behaviors.

Realism in storytelling arises from the careful crafting of these backstories. Some individuals might mimic their parents' lifestyles, while others might deviate entirely based on past experiences. The beauty of character creation lies in the ability of writers to mold these histories, ensuring characters' actions and reactions are logical and credible. As a storyteller, it's essential to ensure that the motivations align with characters' responses, grounding them in relatable realism.
### CREATE CHARACTERS WITH BUILT-IN CONFLICT
**Summary**:

**Character Conflict and Depth in Storytelling**

Creating rich, multi-dimensional characters involves embedding conflict from the very start. This conflict is born from their backstories, desires, strengths, fears, and weaknesses. When characters have solid motivations, it results in deeper conflict, and in turn, creates a stronger narrative. Superficial motivations lead to superficial characters and narratives.

One method to enhance a story is to design seemingly impossible scenarios for the characters, challenging oneself to develop realistic motivations and resolutions to these situations. As an example, the book "Her Colorado Man" involves a premise where a man, Wes, pretends to be the husband and father of the heroine's child. This unlikely scenario was made believable by giving the heroine a son with a secret father and a grandfather who falsely claimed a distant husband to protect the family name. This story's premise was challenging but, once properly motivated, became a gripping narrative.

Additionally, a story should engage the reader's emotions. By using conflict, a storyteller can draw out the character's feelings. If the character feels deeply, so will the reader. A compelling example is from the novel "Her Wyoming Man", where Ella, a woman with a dark past, marries Nathan, an upright man. Their relationship reveals Ella's vulnerability, and the reader joins her in experiencing the foreign concept of love. This deep, emotional bond between the character and the reader is the essence of effective storytelling. 

In the process of storytelling, writers should remain true to their original vision and the elements that ignited their passion. This initial spark is vital for maintaining momentum in the storytelling process. While feedback is essential, some elements should remain untouched to ensure that the story's heart remains intact.
### SIMPLE AND COMPLEX CONFLICTS
**Summary**:

**Understanding Simple and Complex Conflicts in Storytelling**

In storytelling, both simple and complex conflicts play crucial roles in character development and plot progression. While simple conflicts often revolve around internal struggles and character nuances, complex conflicts tend to be externally driven by broader plot points.

For conflicts to be effective, they must be deeply personal and significant to the characters, compelling them to act. The backbone of a character's motivations can be found in their backstory, prime motivating factor, or a prime motivating incident. 

A poignant example is the prologue of Barbara Dawson Smith’s "Fire on the Wind". Here, a young boy named Damien Coleridge desperately seeks affection from his resentful mother. A tragic past incident left his brother an invalid and Damien scarred, leading their mother to blame Damien. After facing intense rejection from her, Damien grows up believing he is unlovable, affecting all his future relationships. This central motivating incident, while starting as a simple internal conflict, gains complexity as the plot unfolds, making Damien's journey all the more engaging.

However, characters don't always need traumatic or negative events to motivate them. A character can have a perfectly harmonious upbringing, fostering a positive outlook on life. Such a character, when paired with a cynic, creates an intriguing dynamic full of conflict.

In essence, for a story to resonate deeply, conflicts must be tailored to individual characters. Knowing the roots of a character’s motivations ensures believable actions and reactions, intensifying the emotional impact of the narrative. Generalized motivations yield weak plots, whereas specificity heightens the emotional depth.
### DEVELOPING BACKSTORY

**Backstory Development in Fiction Writing**

**1. Definition**: Backstory gives context to a character's present, encompassing past events, experiences, and relationships that shaped them.

**2. Components**:

   - **Belief System**: Foundational ideas and values that dictate a character's actions and decisions. This could include religion, political beliefs, and personal philosophies.
   
   - **Values**: Personal priorities and standards that influence behavior. It could be honor, freedom, discipline, or any other guiding principle.
   
   - **Family & Friends**: Relationships, both past and present, are crucial in shaping personality. This could be supportive, conflicted, or somewhere in between.
   
   - **Fears & Phobias**: Everyone has fears; identifying these helps to build depth. A character's response to their fears can drive their actions.
   
   - **Prime Motivating Incident**: This singular, crucial event propels the character into the main story. It acts as a catalyst, pushing characters out of their comfort zones and setting the narrative in motion.

**3. Practical Application**:
In "One for the Money" by Janet Evanovich, Stephanie Plum's past experiences (e.g., her relationship with Joe Morelli) serve as the foundation for the main plot. After facing job loss, her past pushes her towards a new career, establishing the central conflict of the story.

**4. A Cautionary Note**: Overloading the start of a story with too much backstory can be overwhelming and off-putting for readers. It's best to gradually integrate backstory details into the narrative, revealing only what's essential when it's relevant.

In summary, a character's backstory is a pivotal tool in fiction writing. It provides depth, drives motivation, and can be a rich source of conflict and resolution in the narrative. However, like any tool, it must be used thoughtfully to ensure a compelling and cohesive story.
## CHAPTER 29: SHOWING CHANGE IN YOUR CHARACTERS by Nancy Kress

### THE POPEYE PERSONALITY: “I YAM WHAT I YAM”
**Clarified and Summarized Version:**

**The Unchanging Character Motivation: "Steadfast Through The Tale"**

**1. Definition**: Some characters in fiction maintain a consistent motivation and personality throughout a story. They don't undergo significant personal change, but their unwavering nature can be their appeal.

**2. Examples**:

   - **James Bond**: Across Ian Fleming's novels, Bond remains a charismatic and resourceful spy. His mission is assigned at the start, and he relentlessly pursues it till the end. While there may be smaller objectives within this mission, they all align with his main goal.
   
   - **George and Lennie in "Of Mice and Men"**: The duo consistently dreams of owning a farm. Their personalities also remain unchanged: George as the brains and Lennie as the well-intentioned, yet clumsy giant whose actions lead to a tragic ending.

**3. Writing Approach**: If crafting such characters:
   - **Introduce Them Early**: Clearly define their goal and characteristics early in the narrative.
   - **Focus Elsewhere**: Since the character remains steady, you can complexify other elements like the plot, or add twists and surprises.

**4. Emotions**: Even unwavering characters can experience a range of emotions. For instance, Bond might simultaneously feel attracted to and suspicious of one of his romantic interests. If a character encounters conflicting emotions, it's crucial to depict them in the moment. However, it's equally essential to return to the primary goal in subsequent scenes, affirming the character's steadfast nature.

In essence, while some characters undergo transformative arcs, others, like James Bond or George and Lennie, remain true to their initial motivations and traits. These characters offer a reliable touchstone throughout the story, allowing for a focus on other intricate narrative elements.
### PROGRESSIVE MOTIVATION: THE WORLD AS MOVING TARGET

**Progressive Motivation: Adapting to the Evolving World**

**1. Definition**: Characters may not change their core beliefs or personality, but their desires evolve in response to the events in the story. This concept is common in heroes and villains.

**2. Heroes with Progressive Motivation**:

   - **Jane Eyre (from "Jane Eyre")**: Jane remains consistent in her beliefs and personality, valuing dignity and standing against abuse. However, her motivations adapt: from surviving her aunt's mistreatment to seeking new opportunities, and later navigating her complicated relationship with Mr. Rochester.

   - **Howard Roark (from "The Fountainhead")**: Roark's unwavering belief in his architectural vision drives him. He begins by wanting to create unique buildings but evolves to extreme measures, such as destroying them if altered against his designs.

**Key Point**: While a heroic character might not change at the core, the external world provides challenges, and the story flows as the hero adapts to each new challenge.

**3. Villains with Progressive Motivation**:

   - Villains can remain consistent in their malevolent nature. However, as the story unfolds, their ambitions might grow, or their goals shift due to story events. For instance, a criminal's initial aim might be a robbery, but after unintended consequences like killing an officer, his new goal becomes evading capture.

**4. Emotional Complexity**: Regardless of consistent personalities, these characters can experience a spectrum of emotions. Jane Eyre, for example, battles various feelings when considering a loveless marriage for a noble cause. She remains steadfast in her desire for love.

In essence, progressive motivation means characters maintain their core beliefs and personalities but adjust their goals in response to the changing circumstances and challenges presented by the story. This dynamic keeps the narrative engaging and drives the plot forward.
### CHANGERS WITH A SINGLE MOTIVATION: OREGON OR BUST
**Clarified and Summarized Version:**

**Changers with a Single Motivation: Evolution Amidst Consistency**

**1. Concept**:
In certain narratives, while the primary objective of a character remains consistent, their beliefs or personalities undergo a significant transformation. The story often emphasizes this change as the primary focus.

**2. Example**:
A woman wants to escape prison (consistent goal). Initially, she looks down on other inmates. Over time, due to interactions and experiences, she transforms from disdainful to empathetic, realizing they aren't so different.

**3. Key Elements**:
   
   - **Driven by Story Events**: The change in the character should be a direct result of the events in the story. These events must be crafted to logically induce the desired transformation in the character.
   
   - **Emotional Responses**: Characters must emote and react to events, aiding readers in understanding the evolution.
   
   - **Dramatization of Change**: Show the transformation through actions. For example, a character's newfound empathy might be displayed through their helpful actions.
   
   - **Final Validation**: Conclude with an event that affirms the character’s change is permanent, not fleeting.

**4. Inherent Satisfaction**:
Such stories provide gratification to readers. The consistent goal offers clarity, while the character's transformation adds depth and commentary on life.

**5. Positive & Negative Arcs**:
   
   - **Positive Arc**: Transformation leading to positive realizations, like recognizing the value of empathy over scorn.
   
   - **Negative Arc**: A journey from innocence to a "sadder but wiser" state. For instance, in "The House of Mirth", Lily Bart aims to marry rich but realizes the value of love too late.

**6. Cautionary Tales**:
Some narratives portray characters achieving their goals only to face disappointment, highlighting the “be careful what you wish for” theme. The change can lead to regret or bitterness due to the unexpected consequences of their desires.

In essence, "Changers with a Single Motivation" focuses on characters whose primary goal remains constant but undergo a transformation in their beliefs or personalities driven by the events and experiences in the story.
### CHANGERS WITH PROGRESSIVE MOTIVATIONS: WHO AM I AND WHAT DO I WANT NOW?

**Changers with Progressive Motivations: Evolution of Desires and Identity**

**1. Concept**:
Characters with progressive motivations not only alter their objectives during the story but also undergo transformations in their beliefs and personality. It's crucial to maintain clarity for readers amidst these changes.

**2. Example**:
In "The Caine Mutiny" by Herman Wouk, Ensign Willie Keith undergoes various shifts in goals and personal growth:

   - Initially, he joins the Navy to dodge the draft.
   - He tries avoiding perilous assignments and subsequently wants to leave the minesweeper Caine.
   - He grapples with the challenges of serving under the erratic Captain Queeg.
   - He later joins a mutiny against Queeg.
   - Willie aims to evade a court-martial and dishonorable discharge.
   - Ultimately, he aspires to be a competent naval officer and defend his nation.

This journey reflects Willie's internal growth, from a self-centered individual seeking shortcuts to someone valuing duty and honor.

**3. Strengths**:
Having a character with evolving motivations and personal growth provides depth, making it potent for a comprehensive narrative.

**4. Key Guidelines**:

   - **Dramatization of Change**: Portray the transformation through the character's actions and responses.
   
   - **Driven by Story Events**: The changes should emerge logically from events in the story, ensuring that they don't seem random or forced.
   
   - **Emotional Depth**: Characters must react emotionally to events, giving authenticity to their evolution.
   
   - **Validation**: Changes should be solidified by the character's actions, emphasizing the permanence of their transformation.

In a nutshell, "Changers with Progressive Motivations" involves characters experiencing a series of shifting goals and personal transformations throughout the story. This dynamic process demands careful crafting to ensure clarity and authenticity for readers.
### PORTRAYING MOTIVATIONS
**Clarified and Summarized Version:**

**Portraying Character Motivations: Techniques for Illumination**

**1. Concept**:
Motivation is the driving force behind a character's actions. Dramatizing motivation is crucial for readers to understand and empathize with characters. Whether a character has a consistent motivation throughout or multiple evolving goals, it's imperative that the writer clearly depicts them.

**2. Techniques to Illustrate Motivation**:

   - **Internal Monologue**: Allow characters to ponder their desires, like Jane Eyre who yearns for liberty after years of school-life monotony.
   
   - **External Instruction**: Have others set a goal for the character, such as a detective being assigned a murder case.
   
   - **Dialogue**: Characters can discuss their aspirations with others. In "Of Mice and Men", Lennie and George converse about their dream of owning land and living freely.
   
   - **Overheard Conversations**: Other characters can discuss the protagonist’s goals, giving insight without the main character explicitly stating them. For instance, "Jack is striving for his brother’s approval..."
   
   - **Action Demonstrations**: Showcase motivation through the character's repeated efforts. For example, Jack consistently trying to get Cal's notice. Multiple attempts signify the depth of desire beyond mere routine or etiquette.

**3. Flexibility**: 
No single technique is universally perfect. If one doesn’t sufficiently highlight a character's motivation, try incorporating another method or a combination to make it clearer for the reader.

In essence, effectively portraying motivations involves a blend of internal thoughts, dialogues, actions, and interactions. These techniques help writers vividly and authentically represent what drives their characters, enhancing the narrative's depth and relatability.
### THE KEY TO JUGGLING MOTIVATION AND CHARACTER CHANGE

**Mastering Motivation and Character Development: The Power of Scenes**

**1. The Challenge**:
Writing with intertwined elements of motivation, emotion, character transformation, and detailed portrayal can feel daunting. How can an author stay focused and effectively communicate these intertwined elements?

**2. The Solution: Write in Scenes**:
- **Focus**: Don’t try to encapsulate the entire narrative or the progression of multiple characters simultaneously. Instead, concentrate on one scene at a time.
  
- **Purposeful Writing**: Before diving into a scene, understand its goals. For instance, in the scenario of the son discovering the will that benefits a veterinary hospital:
    - Communicate the will's contents.
    - Depict the son as greedy and angry.
    - Establish the son's motivation to challenge the will's validity.

- **Dramatization Over Explanation**: Use actions to depict emotions and motivations. Instead of simply stating the son's rage, show him reacting — tearing the room apart, kicking a cat, or having a drink to calm himself.

- **Stay Flexible**: Preplanned scene elements serve as guides. If a better idea emerges while writing, adapt. 

**3. Interaction Amplifies Character Development**: 
Though our example scene focused on one character, scenes with multiple characters offer even richer opportunities for character development through interactions and reactions.

---

In summary, harnessing the power of scenes aids in managing complex character motivations and transformations. By focusing on individual scenes and their purposes, authors can effectively dramatize emotions and character motivations, thereby weaving a compelling narrative.

## CHAPTER 30: ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS by Victoria Lynn Schmidt
**Clarified and Summarized Version:**

**The Significance of Romantic Relationships in Storytelling by Victoria Lynn Schmidt**

**1. Universal Importance of Love**:
- Love is a powerful and universal theme in storytelling, resonating with readers on both personal and universal levels. It's a theme that everyone can relate to, and it's prevalent in notable books, movies, and entertainment.
- Forms of love in literature can range from unrequited love to passionate, tragic love.

**2. The Challenge of Depicting Genuine Love**:
- While many writers can depict the longing or absence of love, portraying characters genuinely in love poses challenges. Questions to consider include: How is their love expressed? Who falls for whom first? How does their love influence the story and their personal growth?

**3. The Decision of Including Love**:
- Not all stories necessitate a romantic subplot. However, understanding how to weave love and relationships into a narrative is a crucial skill for writers.
- Love elements can enhance even the most action-packed tales. For example, a hero's past love can provide rich backstory and depth to the character.

**4. Historical Love Letters: Love Transcends Titles**:
- Love is not bound by status or occupation. Great leaders and soldiers, like Napoleon and King Henry VIII, have written passionate love letters, revealing deep emotions and vulnerabilities. These letters demonstrate that even influential figures are not immune to the universal pull of love.

*Excerpts from Love Letters*:
- **Napoleon Bonaparte**: He expresses intense longing for the Empress Josephine, highlighting the depth of his feelings and the sheer power of love's influence.
- **King Henry VIII**: In his letter to Lady Anne Boleyn, King Henry VIII's words brim with passion and longing, revealing a side of the king not often showcased in history books.

---

In essence, incorporating romantic relationships in storytelling taps into a universal human emotion. Whether subtle or overt, the theme of love can add depth, emotional resonance, and relatability to any narrative.
### ROMANTIC TENSION
**Clarified and Summarized Version:**

---

**The Essence of Romantic Tension in Storytelling**

**1. Importance of Romance**:
- Romance is a universally appealing theme. The booming romance novel market and the high earnings of romance authors emphasize its importance.
- Almost everyone is intrigued by love, which is evident in the presence of romantic subplots even in action-packed movies.

**2. Three Types of Intimate Scenes**:

   a. **Anticipation**: 
      - This revolves around the yearning of lovers to be together but facing obstacles that prevent their union. These obstacles not only keep them apart but also increase the readers' eagerness to see them unite.
      - External factors like jobs or commitments can act as distractions, leading to increased longing and daydreaming between the pair.
   
   b. **Submission**: 
      - Here, one partner is so deeply in love that they'd do almost anything to get the same love reciprocated. For instance, a lover waiting for their partner to end another relationship or someone proving their love.
      - The central question is, "Will their love be reciprocated?"
   
   c. **Empowerment**: 
      - This involves a shift in traditional gender roles, often leading to a female character taking charge. She might be ready to walk away from the relationship, not due to the man's submissiveness, but due to her strength and independence.
      - Although traditionally, men have had more societal power, this dynamic allows for a refreshing change, asking, "Will she leave him?" Conversely, empowered men might also make the tough choice to leave.
   
   - Characters who find empowerment are usually very self-assured and independent. They value their individual identities and can stand apart from their partners confidently.

**3. Love Letter Exercise**:
   - As a writing exercise, authors should pen a love letter between their main characters. This can reveal surprising aspects of a character's psyche and backstory.

---

In short, romantic tension is vital in storytelling because of its universal appeal. Introducing elements like anticipation, submission, and empowerment can add depth and intrigue to any romantic arc or subplot.
### WRITING ABOUT LOVE
**Clarified and Summarized Version:**

---

**The Role of Love in Storytelling**

1. **The Complexity of Love**:
    - Writing about love is challenging due to the vulnerability and insecurities it evokes, paired with the potential for profound pain.

2. **Love in Action Stories**:
    - Action writers might question the inclusion of love in their narratives. However, romance often complements action, providing additional motivation for characters.
    - Many heroes in action stories pursue romantic interests, not just for physical relationships but for genuine connections. 
    - While the romantic subplot might not be the focus, elements of romance are still evident, even if briefly.

3. **Love in Romance Stories**:
    - For romance writers, blending the elements of masculine and feminine journeys with romantic arcs can add depth.
    - Rather than sidelining the romance, the main plot serves as a backbone, allowing the romantic relationship to flourish.
    - Using traditional journey models for the main plot and romantic journeys for the subplot can enrich character-driven stories. In these stories, the hero or heroine faces challenges, with romantic elements becoming the core challenges.
    - The romance can be woven into an adventurous main plot, offering readers a layered experience.

4. **Example - Barbara Cartland's Romance Novels**:
    - Cartland’s works, which have sold billions, follow a consistent romance model similar to Cinderella's story. A young, innocent girl meets a seasoned, older man who introduces her to love and transforms her into a "princess".
    - Despite the central romantic theme, Cartland’s novels often include adventurous elements, akin to James Bond adventures, set in exotic locales with world-saving missions.

---

In essence, love is an integral component in storytelling, regardless of genre. Whether serving as the primary theme in romance novels or as a subplot in action stories, love adds depth, motivation, and universal appeal to narratives.

---

This table clearly outlines Frodo Baggins' external and internal journeys in "The Lord of the Rings", showing his evolution from a simple Hobbit to a hero.
## CHAPTER 32: THE ARC WITHIN PLOT by James Scott Bell

James Scott Bell argues that the true power of a plot lies in its ability to drive character transformation. Memorable stories are not just about external events but about how these events shape and change the protagonists. This transformation can be profound, like Scrooge in "A Christmas Carol", or more nuanced, like Scarlett O’Hara in "Gone with the Wind". While there are novels where characters remain largely static, these typically aren't seen as enduring classics. Even in series, slight character development can lift a story from being just entertaining to something more profound. Two examples given are Sue Grafton’s Kinsey Millhone and Robert B. Parker’s Spencer. The emphasis is on ensuring characters in novels grow, which not only deepens the plot but also underscores larger themes about life's broader lessons.
### THE CHARACTER ARC
**Summary and Clarification**

**Character Arc Explained**:
The character arc is the evolution of a character's internal state across a story. It's the transformational journey a character undertakes due to external events and self-realization, ending up different than they were at the start. An example from "The Wizard of Oz" shows Dorothy transitioning from a dreamer wanting more from life to realizing the value of home.

**Key Components of a Character Arc**:

1. **Beginning Point**: This is where the character's initial state is introduced. Using the character Ebenezer Scrooge from "A Christmas Carol" as an example, Scrooge starts as a selfish, miserly man.
 
2. **Layers**: Characters have a core self shaped by their experiences, beliefs, values, and attitudes. Scrooge's core is that of a miser who values money over people.

3. **Impacting Incidents**: Events challenge the character's layers. In "A Christmas Carol", Scrooge is visited by ghosts who show him his past, present, and potential future.

4. **Deepening Disturbances**: As the story progresses, events intensify, forcing the character to confront their flaws or beliefs more deeply. For Scrooge, the realization of his future and Tiny Tim's potential death profoundly affect him.

5. **Moment of Change**: Often manifested as an epiphany, this is where the character realizes the need for change. Scrooge experiences this when he begs the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come to show him a way to alter his future.

6. **Aftermath**: Post-epiphany, the character's change is demonstrated through their actions. Scrooge, for instance, becomes charitable, caring, and kind.

**Additional Insight**:

In stories like "A Christmas Carol", the character arc is explicit. However, in other tales, the arc might be subtler. Regardless, it's vital to portray the character's change convincingly. One technique to portray change is having the character confront their past self. This juxtaposition effectively highlights their transformation.

For writers, it's essential to handle the epiphany with care to avoid over-dramatization. Sometimes, the change can be implied through post-epiphany actions, subtly showing the transformation without overtly stating it.

## CHAPTER 33: THE KNOT by Jeff Gerke
**Summary & Clarification: "The Knot" by Jeff Gerke**

**The Main Point:**
Characters in fiction need problems, or "knots," to give depth to their journey. These problems serve as central conflicts for the story. The writer should also offer an alternative or resolution to these problems, challenging the character's beliefs and pushing their personal growth.

**Details:**

1. **Character's Problem ("The Knot"):** 
   - A character's problem can range from personal flaws, like selfishness or hubris, to modern issues like addiction.
   - Think of this problem as a knot in a rope; it disrupts the character's life and hinders smooth sailing. 
   - Example: A protagonist grieving the death of a loved one might be stuck in sorrow, failing to see how this grief affects their life.

2. **Finding the Knot:**
   - When choosing a problem, be creative and deep. Dive into the root causes of the character's issue.
   - The problem should be significant enough to drive an entire novel.
   - Use personal experiences, or delve into psychological reasons behind a character's flaw or problem.

3. **Consider the Alternative:** 
   - While deciding on a character's problem, also envision a potential resolution or an alternative scenario.
   - This alternative should contrast the character's problem, providing a possible path to growth or change.
   - Example: A character who avoids relationships due to past trauma might find healing and connection as an alternative.

4. **Reaching the Alternative:** 
   - Achieving the resolution won't be easy. Characters may resist change due to comfort in their existing state.
   - The tension between the character's problem and the potential resolution is what drives the story.

**About the Author:**
Jeff Gerke is a published author and founder of Marcher Lord Press. He offers services like editing and book cover designs. He emphasizes the importance of a character's internal journey in storytelling.

In essence, Gerke advises writers to give their characters deep-rooted issues, explore their causes, and challenge these issues with equally compelling alternatives or resolutions. This creates a dynamic internal journey for the character and a gripping narrative for readers.
## CHAPTER 34: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH by Jeff Gerke
**Jeff Gerke's "The Knot" and "Tying the Knot" Summary:**

Jeff Gerke highlights the importance of providing your main character with a "knot," a central problem or challenge that drives the narrative. This issue can range from personal flaws and fears to tragedies and traumas. The "knot" symbolizes an obstacle in the character's life, similar to how a knot in a rope can disrupt its function. 

Examples of these challenges include unresolved anger, selfishness, guilt, or deeper traumas like addiction or loss. The chosen problem should be deeply rooted in the character's personality and history, ensuring that it's integral to their identity.

The story should also present an alternative to the character's "knot." This alternative offers the character a potential path to happiness, healing, or growth. However, achieving this alternative is not easy. The tension between the problem and its potential solution forms the core of the narrative.

Gerke provides several examples of "knots" from literature and film to illustrate his point, emphasizing the need for the problem to be significant enough to carry an entire novel. The key is to deeply understand the root of the character's issue and provide a compelling alternative, setting the stage for the character's internal struggle throughout the story.

**Key Points:**

1. Every main character needs a "knot" or central problem.
2. This problem can be a flaw, fear, trauma, or any other significant challenge.
3. The story should also present a potential solution or alternative to the "knot."
4. The tension between the "knot" and its solution drives the narrative.
5. It's essential to deeply understand the character's issue and provide a compelling alternative.

**SUMMARY AND CLARIFICATION**

**The Moment of Truth by Jeff Gerke**

**Main Points:**
1. **"The Moment of Truth" in Writing:** Gerke discusses the climax of a story when the main character faces a crucial decision that determines the outcome. Using "The Lord of the Rings" as an example, Frodo's pivotal choice at Mount Doom epitomizes this moment of truth.
  
2. **Significance of the Ending:** A story's ending, particularly the climactic decision, is integral. By visualizing the conclusion, a writer can chart the narrative's progression towards that climactic moment. The entire story essentially serves as a buildup to this decisive instant.

3. **Understanding the Moment of Truth:** This moment revolves around a character's decision between two paths. Throughout the narrative, characters face smaller decisions leading up to this monumental one. It’s when the character comprehends the consequences of both choices, and then acts, that the story reaches its peak.

4. **Famous Moments of Truth:** Gerke highlights examples from literature and film, illustrating how characters are brought to crucial decisions, understanding the potential outcomes, and then making their choice. Examples include Romeo in "Romeo and Juliet," Darth Vader in "Return of the Jedi," and Captain Ahab in "Moby Dick."

**Clarification:**
The "moment of truth" is a fundamental narrative device where the protagonist is faced with a significant choice that determines the trajectory of the story. It represents the pinnacle of a character's internal and external struggles, culminating in a decision with profound implications. This moment doesn’t just drive the climax; it's the reason the story exists. For a compelling story, this moment must be carefully constructed, allowing readers to fully grasp the weight of the decision and its consequences.
## CHAPTER 35: REVISING FOR STRONG CHARACTER by Jack Smith

**Summary and Clarification:**

**Strong Characterization in Fiction:**

1. **Importance of Strong Characters**: While a story may begin with an idea, the characters should not merely act as vessels for this idea. Instead, they should be robust, developed, and complex, thus attracting readers. Strong characters are not necessarily heroes but are well-developed, multi-faceted individuals.

2. **Character Depth and Range**: Strong characters, also known as "round" characters, have multifaceted personalities, motivations, and actions. They are believable and relatable due to their depth.

3. **Creating a Round Character**: 
    - **Physical and Psychological Aspects**: A character's overall makeup consists of their physical appearance, personality, quirks, habits, and speech patterns. Without these, a character lacks distinction and depth.
    - **Example**: Saul Bellow and Vladimir Nabokov provide rich descriptions of their characters in their works, making them distinct and memorable.

4. **Methods of Characterization**:
    - **Direct Method**: This involves describing the protagonist's appearance and qualities in detail.
        - **Considerations**: If written in third person, avoid authorial intrusion. Ensure actions align with character descriptions.
    - **Indirect or Dramatic Method**: Here, the character is built mostly through scenes and their actions and speech. 
        - **Example**: Cormac McCarthy uses minimalistic style, hinting at character traits instead of spelling them out.
    - **Combined Approach**: Writers might mix both methods to various degrees based on the narrative's needs.

5. **Making a Character Fully Human**: As part of the revision process:
    - Equip characters with multiple goals or behaviors.
    - Give them diverse interests.
    - Introduce internal conflicts.
    - Assign quirks or distinctive speech patterns.
    - However, avoid overwhelming the character with too many traits. 

6. **Believable Motivations**: 
    - **Contradictory Nature**: Humans are inherently contradictory. Characters should reflect this, making them more relatable.
    - **Context is Key**: Even if a character's actions defy conventional wisdom, ensure the narrative context makes it believable.
    - **Ambiguity in Motives**: Like real people, characters might not always understand their motivations, which can create a layer of depth and interest.

In essence, Jack Smith emphasizes the importance of creating complex, round characters in fiction to make stories more relatable and engaging for readers.

**SUMMARY AND CLARIFICATION**

**Character Motivation:**
1. **Personality & Temperament:** A character's motivation is shaped by their personality and temperament. Introverts and extroverts, or people who are easily angered vs. those who are calm, may react differently to the same situation. When creating characters, consider if their actions align with their personality.
2. **Antagonists:** Antagonists drive character motivations. They can be personal, societal, or natural. The relationship and reactions between the protagonist and antagonist should reveal the core attributes of the main character.
3. **Character's Past:** A character's history can influence their actions, but avoid oversimplifying the cause-effect relationship. Ensure that past events are compelling enough to justify present actions.
4. **Character's Actions:** Actions shape and reflect a character's motivations. Actions also change a character. For instance, committing a crime might forever alter a person's perception of themselves. Ensure that characters' actions are complex, showing the intricate nature of human motivations.

**Realistic Dialogue:**
1. **Avoid Prepared Speech:** Dialogue should sound natural and not like a rehearsed speech.
2. **Use Dialect with Care:** If incorporating accents or regional speech, research thoroughly to ensure authenticity and avoid stereotypes.
3. **Avoid Cliched Dialogue:** Ensure characters have unique and genuine voices.
4. **Reveal Character Through Dialogue:** What characters say, or choose not to say, can reveal their motivations and personalities.

**Dynamic vs. Static Characters:**
- **Round Characters:** These characters evolve throughout the story. Their behaviors or viewpoints may change due to events or realizations. For instance, the protagonist in "The Yellow Wallpaper" undergoes significant change due to her oppressive environment.
- **Flat Characters:** These characters remain mostly unchanged. An example is Billy Budd, who remains consistently good throughout his story.
- Significant character changes must be justified and believable. Characters should not change drastically without reason or over trivial events.

**Revision Tips for Dynamic Characters:**
- Look for signs of potential change in the character's personality, past, interactions with other characters, and reactions to major events.
- Remember, while character development should be logical, it shouldn't be overly predictable. An air of mystery or some unresolved questions can make the story more engaging for the reader.
