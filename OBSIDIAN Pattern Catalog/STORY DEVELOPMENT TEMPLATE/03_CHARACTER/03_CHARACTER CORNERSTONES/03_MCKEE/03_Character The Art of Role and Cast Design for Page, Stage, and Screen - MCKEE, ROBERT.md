#03_CHARACTER 

# INTRODUCTION

**Character’s primary purpose is to enrich your insights into the nature of the fictional character** and sharpen your creative techniques as you invent a complex, never-seen before cast of personalities, starting with your protagonist, then moving outward through your first, second, and third circles of supporting roles, ending with the nameless passing at the far edges of episodes.

In the chapters that follow, the principle of contradiction underpins virtually every lesson in character design. I play opposites against each other: characters versus human beings, institutions versus individuals, traits versus truths, the outer life versus the inner life, and so on. You and I know, of course, that along any spectrum strung between polar extremes, shades of possibility blur into overlaps and admixtures. But for clear, facile perception of character complexity, a writer needs a sensitivity to contrast and paradox, an eye for contradiction that unearths the full range of creative possibility. This book teaches that skill.

Characters taken from all eras serve two purposes: (1) The task of an illustration is to exemplify and clarify the point at hand, and, as it happens, the sharpest example is often history’s first. (2) I want you to take pride in your profession. As you write, you join an ancient, noble, truth telling tradition. Brilliant casts from the past will set the stage for your future writings.

Character has four parts. 
**Part One: In Praise of Characters** (Chapters One through Three) explores sources of inspiration for character invention and lays out the foundational work that shapes your talents toward creating superbly imagined fictional human beings. 
**Part Two: Building a Character** (Chapters Four through Thirteen) pursues the creation of never-met-before characters, beginning with methods from the outside in, followed by the inside out, expanding into dimensionality and complexity, ending with roles at their most radical. As Somerset Maugham expressed it, “The only inexhaustible subject is human nature.” 
**Part Three: The Character Universe** (Chapters Fourteen through Sixteen) contexts character by genre, performance, and reader/audience/character relationships. 
**Part Four: Character Relationships** (Chapter Seventeen) illustrates the principles and techniques of cast design by mapping the dramatis personae of five works taken from prose, cinema, theatre, and longform television. 

All told, I will parse the universe of character into its galaxies, galaxies into solar systems, solar systems into planets, planets into ecologies, ecologies into the life force all in order to help you uncover creative meanings in the human mystery.
