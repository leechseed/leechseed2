## 1. What are a Character's Internal Traits?
**Assignment Worksheet: Applying Character Contradictions for Enhanced Storytelling**

*Objective*: To help writers create layered, believable characters by integrating and expressing contradictions in their traits and actions.

**1. Character Profile Creation**
* Name your character:
* Age:
* Occupation:
* Primary goal in the story:

**2. Identifying Contradictions in Physical Appearance**
* Describe your character's physical appearance:
* Choose one physical attribute and create a contradiction based on ironic juxtaposition (e.g., a strong-looking character named "Tiny").

**3. Multi-Faceted Social Roles**
* List three social roles your character plays in their life (e.g., parent, employee, friend):
  1.
  2.
  3.
* Choose one of these roles and describe a situation where the character might act out of character or contradictory to their usual behavior in that role.

**4. Exploring Moral Dilemmas**
* List a strong moral or ethical belief of your character:
* Now, describe a situation where your character might act in contradiction to this belief:

**5. Secrets and Deceit**
* Describe a secret your character is hiding:
* How might this secret cause them to act in ways that are contradictory to their public persona?

**6. Conscious vs. Unconscious Traits**
* List one positive trait your character is consciously aware of:
* List one negative trait your character suppresses or is unconscious of:
* Describe a scene where the suppressed trait slips out, catching someone off guard.

**7. Crafting Dispositional Contradictions**
* From the earlier list of your character's internal traits, choose one:
* Now, create a contradiction to that trait. This could be an opposing behavior, a paradoxical belief, or an unusual habit that doesn't align with the primary trait.

**8. Reflection and Analysis**
* How do these contradictions make your character more interesting or relatable?
* What challenges might you face in weaving these contradictions into your story seamlessly?
* How might these contradictions drive your story's plot or conflict?

*Note*: Remember that while contradictions can add depth and complexity, they should still be believable. Always consider the backstory or underlying reasons that might cause your character to possess these contradictory traits or make contradictory decisions.

## 2. What are the Character's External Traits?
**Assignment Worksheet: Analyzing and Applying Character's External Traits**

*Objective*: To assist writers in understanding and effectively integrating a character's external traits, ensuring that their behaviors are observed, interpreted, or misinterpreted by other characters in the narrative.

**1. Character Profile Creation**
* Name your character:
* Age:
* Occupation:
* Primary goal in the story:

**2. Defining Observable External Traits**
* List three external traits that your character prominently displays:
  1.
  2.
  3.

**3. Perception and Misconception**
* Choose one of the external traits listed above:
* Describe a scene where another character observes this trait:
* Now, explain how this observing character might misconstrue or inaccurately interpret the trait:

**4. Intentional Projections vs. Unintended Behavior**
* Choose another external trait from your list:
* Is this trait something your character intentionally projects? Why or why not?
* Describe a scene where this trait is on display and note whether other characters believe it's genuine or just a fa√ßade:

**5. External Reflections of Internal Traits**
* Recall an internal trait from the previous worksheet:
* How does this internal trait manifest as an external behavior?
* Describe a scenario where this behavior catches another character off guard:

**6. Contextual Behavior**
* Take the last external trait from your list:
* Describe two different contexts (e.g., a party vs. a funeral) and how your character might display this trait differently in each setting:

**7. External Contradictions**
* Choose an external trait that seemingly contradicts one of the character's internal traits:
* Explain why you've chosen this contradiction:
* Create a scene where another character notices this contradiction and reacts to it:

**8. Reflection and Analysis**
* How do these external traits, and their perceptions by other characters, drive the interactions and dynamics in your story?
* Are there any challenges you anticipate in making these traits believable or consistent?
* How do the external traits push the narrative forward or create conflict?

*Note*: Strive for balance. While it's crucial to introduce dynamic external traits and their interpretations, ensure that they don't overshadow the core essence of your character.
