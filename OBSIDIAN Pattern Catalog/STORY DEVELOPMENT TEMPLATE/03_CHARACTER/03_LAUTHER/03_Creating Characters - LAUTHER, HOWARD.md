## Introduction 
**Summary and Clarification:**

"Creating Characters" is a reference book designed for writers who want to deeply understand their fictional characters before writing about them. It is not a step-by-step manual but a guide that poses questions about a character's traits, needs, fears, beliefs, and profession. These questions aim to help writers create a detailed biography for their characters. In response to each question, the book either offers various answers or prompts more in-depth questions. The objective is to stimulate profound contemplation about the characters who propel the story.

The tools and resources within the book are likened to a toolbox; they provide necessary instruments for construction. However, the final masterpiece—the captivating story filled with multifaceted characters—relies on the writer's personal insight, innate talent, and storytelling skill. This book emphasizes the importance of developing unique characters to avoid resorting to cliches or stereotypes. It stands firm on the idea that compelling characters lead to compelling stories, not vice versa.

While the book provides a thorough examination of character development, it does not prescribe an exact method to produce captivating characters or compelling narratives. Such a journey is personal and must be undertaken by each writer individually. For practical purposes, the book uses a single gender pronoun for descriptions, but the content is meant to be applicable to characters of any gender. The Table of Contents acts as a gateway to explore the book's depth. Overall, "Creating Characters" offers a holistic approach to character creation, urging writers to delve deep into their understanding of their characters.

## 1. What are a Character's Internal Traits?
**Summary and Clarification:**

Internal traits of a fictional character refer to their inner qualities and characteristics which are not always obvious to other characters within the story. For instance, while an adventurous spirit may be evident in a character's actions, traits like intuition or keen observation might be more subtle. It's the author's responsibility to share these traits with the readers, but they might decide to keep some of these traits hidden from other characters in the narrative.

There are two main sources of internal traits:

1. **Inborn Traits**: These are inherent qualities determined by genetics. They're consistent throughout a character's life, though their intensity might vary based on external factors like the environment or particular situations.

2. **Acquired Traits**: These are developed over time due to experiences, education, social environment, or specific life events. For instance, a character might become cynical due to past betrayals. Some of these acquired traits can be temporary. They might appear at the start of a story or develop as the plot unfolds and can disappear just as quickly, depending on the narrative's direction. An example given is "discontent," which can evaporate once a character's desires are fulfilled.

The passage also suggests that there's a list of internal traits that can serve as a resource for writers in character development.

## 2. What are the Character's External Traits?
**Summary and Clarification:**

The text delves into how other characters in a story perceive a specific character based on their external traits or behavior, rather than their physical appearance. The author of the story has the discretion to decide which characters are privy to certain behaviors and which are not. For instance, one character might be aware that another is prone to violence, while others might be oblivious to this fact.

There are key considerations when defining a character's external traits:

1. **Accuracy of Perception**: Just because a character observes a trait doesn't mean their perception is accurate. A character might be perceived as brave by others, but in reality, they may be cowardly.
 
2. **Intention vs. Misinterpretation**: The character being observed might intentionally project certain traits, or their actions might be misconstrued by others.

3. **Relationship between Internal and External Traits**: While some external behaviors might directly reflect internal traits, in many instances, they might differ or require separate analysis.

The text also offers a list of external traits for authors to consider when crafting characters. It's essential to note that a character can exhibit contradictory traits; for instance, they might be sociable in one context and not in another. Regardless, all external traits are observable to some characters within the story, but not necessarily to every character.

## 3. What Does the Character Want, Not Want, or Need?
**Summary and Clarification:**

The playwright Neil Simon believed that every central fictional character should have desires or wants. This idea emphasizes not just what a character desires, but also what they want to avoid and what they truly need. While it's not obligatory for an author to ponder these aspects for every character, understanding these aspects can give depth and clarity to a character's motivations and development.

Considerations for a writer regarding a character's wants and needs include:

1. **Timing of Realization**: Determine when the character becomes aware of their wants, needs, or aversions, or if they ever do.
 
2. **Changing Wants and Needs**: Circumstances can change a character's desires. The movie "Tootsie" exemplifies this with its protagonist shifting goals based on the unfolding plot.

3. **Differences between Wants and Needs**: While a character may achieve their desires, it might not necessarily align with their true needs, leading to potential dissatisfaction.

4. **Reasons Behind Desires**: Understanding why a character has specific wants or fears can define their motives. 

5. **Practicality of Wants**: Characters might desire something others deem unrealistic. The writer then decides whether to make the dream achievable or keep it elusive.

6. **Plot-Driven Obstacles**: To build tension, the writer introduces challenges that hinder the character from achieving their goals.

7. **Supporting Characters**: Some characters can aid the protagonist in their pursuits, while others might compete for the same goal.

8. **Sacrifices for Wants and Needs**: Often, characters might have to give up something valuable to achieve their desires.

After introducing these key concepts, the original text seems to delve into categories or types of wants and needs for characters, presented in a question format. These categories serve as a starting point for authors to define their characters' desires more precisely.

### ADVENTURE

**Does the character want a thirst for excitement?**

## 4. What Does the Character Like or Dislike?
**Summary and Clarification:**

Every individual has personal likes and dislikes, and fictional characters are no exception. While simple preferences like enjoying Van Gogh's art or disliking the color blue might seem trivial, when combined with more profound traits and desires, these nuances add depth to a character, similar to how spices enhance the flavor of soup.

There are times when simply stating a character's preference might suffice, like someone liking hot dogs. However, occasionally, to make the narrative more engaging, an explanation for more unusual dislikes, such as hating parades, could be essential. For instance, if a character despises parades due to their past military experiences, this detail provides deeper insight into their past and emotions.

Incorporating a character's indifference can also be impactful. Imagine one character expressing strong feelings about Thanksgiving or baseball, while another displays complete apathy. Such interactions can create tension or reveal character dynamics.

## 5. What Does the Character Fear?
**Summary and Clarification:**
The emotion of fear is a powerful tool in storytelling, with its ability to deeply affect characters and, by extension, engage audiences. While horror and adventure genres often exploit explicit fears like monsters or dangerous situations, this section is more concerned with subtle, internal fears that many individuals can relate to. These are fears that stealthily emerge, unsettling characters and pushing them towards decisive actions.

A crucial aspect to consider when crafting character-centered fear is its legitimacy. If a fear isn't warranted, it's likely self-imposed. This distinction can pivot the narrative in different directions. For instance, if a woman erroneously fears her husband no longer loves her because he's working excessively, when in truth he's merely trying to financially support them, this misinterpretation offers multiple story avenues. Conversely, if her fears are valid, the narrative trajectory will vary, but be equally compelling.

#### A Word About Phobias
**Summary and Clarification: "A Word About Phobias"**
Phobias refer to intense, often irrational fears. In the realm of fiction, phobias can be powerful tools for writers to utilize, adding depth to characters and tension to plots. When introducing a phobia in a character, a writer typically has three choices:

1. **Dramatic Impact**: Use the phobia briefly for dramatic effect in specific scenes.
   - *Example*: In "Raiders of the Lost Ark", the protagonist's fear of snakes is revealed early on. This knowledge makes a later scene, where he's surrounded by snakes, more intense for viewers.

2. **Character's Psychology**: Integrate the phobia deeply into the character's psychology, affecting their daily life and behavior. This requires consistency, reminding the audience about the phobia and occasionally elaborating on its origin.
   - *Example*: A character with claustrophobia stemming from a childhood incident might live in open spaces and avoid cars. This phobia impacts his relationships and daily choices. For a genuine depiction, a writer may describe the incident causing the phobia, emphasizing its influence on the character's life.

3. **Combination of Both**: Start with the psychological grounding and culminate with a high-impact scene confronting the phobia.
   - This approach requires careful build-up. By laying the groundwork, a climactic scene where the character faces their fear will have a profound effect on the reader.

While phobias can intensify a story's emotional impact, it's crucial to handle them sensitively. The narrative doesn't always need a resolution, where the character overcomes their fear. Sometimes, it's more realistic and relatable for the character to continue struggling, avoiding clichés or melodrama.

The passage concludes with a list of various phobias, ranging from common ones like fear of heights (acrophobia) or snakes (ophidiophobia) to more specific fears like fear of being touched (haptephobia) or fear of new things (neophobia). This list serves as a reference for writers looking to explore different character phobias in their narratives.
## 6. What Does the Character Believe?
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters' beliefs play a crucial role in shaping stories and their development. If a character's belief doesn't contribute significantly to the story or their depth, then it's often redundant. For instance, a character's preference for vegetables over meat might be inconsequential, whereas a more controversial belief, such as racial superiority, can profoundly impact the story, showcasing deep character motivations and actions, like affiliating with a radical group.

Authors should think of storytelling as a journey of discovery. This chapter's objective is to guide writers in understanding and exploring the domain of characters' beliefs. Two primary kinds of beliefs are highlighted:

1. **Temporary Belief**: These are beliefs that stand until proven wrong. An instance would be a character suspecting someone of a crime, only to find out they were mistaken. Temporary beliefs can stimulate actions and shift storylines, e.g., a character trying to mediate a fight based on a misconception could find himself becoming the target.

2. **Core Belief**: Formed over time, these beliefs are deeply ingrained in a character due to education, upbringing, personal experiences, and societal influences. Changing a core belief typically requires a substantial event or revelation because of their foundational nature in the character's psyche. People usually defend core beliefs passionately, as they form an essential part of their identity.

Beliefs generally stem from six sources:
1. Personal experiences.
2. Observations.
3. Things heard.
4. Reading materials.
5. Educational teachings.
6. Intuitive feelings.

When incorporating a belief into a character's makeup, writers should consider various aspects. For example, understanding the origin of the belief, evaluating its correctness, and pondering its impact on the character's decisions and interactions with others. A crucial point to note is ensuring the character's beliefs are genuinely theirs and not just a reflection of the author's personal convictions.

In conclusion, beliefs can be powerful storytelling tools that offer myriad possibilities for character development and plot progression.

### FORMAL PHILOSOPHIES

What follows is a brief explanation of some specific philosophies. In trying to fashion a rather loose philosophy for a character you have in mind, you may find something here that fits their nature. You could even use a combination of two or more.

#### Agnostic
Holds the opinion that nothing in life, including God and the origin of life itself, can be known by man.

#### Atheist
Convinced that God does not exist. Lacks any true faith. Sometimes called an infidel.

#### Deist
Believes that God exists, but completely rejects the idea that the Christian scriptures (Bible) are God's revelation.

#### Dualist
Believes that the universe is neither idealistic nor materialistic, but rather is comprised of mind and matter. A theological dualist sees life as a struggle between the forces of good and evil. An ethical dualist, however, thinks it is proper to alter one's conduct to satisfy the social group one is in.

#### Empiricist
Thinks that all knowledge is gained through the senses.

#### Hedonist
Believes in self-indulgence; permits oneself to excessively engage in all pleasures available.

#### Humanist
Believes that man's cultural and practical interests and developments are more important than those that are material or scientific.

#### Materialist
Places more value on man's earthly interests.

#### Mystic
Convinced that one is especially in union with God and that one has been given spiritual knowledge, gained through either intuition or meditation. In this capacity, one may initiate or be a rapt witness to certain occult rites.

#### Naturalist
Holds the belief that all things occur because of natural causes and that they can be scientifically explained.

#### Nominalist
Thinks that abstract ideas have no reality and are names only.

#### Pantheist
Believes that everything that exists, including that which we cannot see, such as the boundless journey of our minds, is, in fact, God.

#### Positivist
Rejects pure speculation. Believes that only well-known facts, including that which can be perceived, represent the only worthwhile knowledge.

#### Pragmatist
Accepts the reality of intangible ideas and thoughts, and yet measures their worth by their practicality only.

#### Rationalist
Convinced that elusive truth and knowledge can be gained only through reason, not experience.

#### Realist
Spurns ideals and accepts only what one knows to be facts; yet believes that abstract concepts, e.g., love and hate, have an existence that is more real than physical matter.

#### Supernaturalist
Convinced that a higher power transcends natural law, that events are divinely inspired.

#### Theist
Feels sure that God is perfect; that He is the Creator and ruler of the universe.

#### Utilitarian
Believes that the greatest good for most of the people should be the goal and leans heavily toward material needs rather than spiritual. In their eyes, usefulness is the great leveler.

#### Vitalist
Holds that intuition is greater than intellect and esteems man's inherent creative power. Believes that the beginning of life was not organic or material.

### Informal Philosophies
**Summary and Clarification: "Informal Philosophies"**

Everyone possesses an "informal philosophy", an evolving set of beliefs and convictions about various life aspects. These beliefs don't necessarily adhere to any particular named philosophy or school of thought but shape the way individuals perceive and interact with the world. These convictions can stem from various categories, including:

1. **Basic Concepts**: What are the character's personal definitions or views on concepts like courage, love, justice, success, and friendship? For instance, how do they perceive the nature of work? How do they interpret past experiences? And what are their anticipations for the future?

2. **Duty to Oneself**: Does the character prioritize self-care or self-interest above all else? Do they believe that one should always be self-reliant and pursue personal happiness, even at the expense of others?

3. **Duty to Others**: To what extent does the character feel responsible for the welfare of others? This encompasses a range of behaviors, from maintaining friendships and promises to being respectful, honest, and charitable.

4. **Eternal Questions**: This category dives deeper into the spiritual and existential beliefs of a character. How do they perceive concepts like God, Satan, the afterlife, virtues, vices, and the nature of good and evil?

5. **Feelings About the Government**: What are the character's political inclinations? How do they view the role of the government in the lives of its citizens? This can encompass views on taxation, the fairness of the political system, and preferred forms of governance.

In essence, exploring a character's informal philosophy gives depth to their motivations, actions, and decisions, creating a more holistic and believable portrayal in storytelling.

### Proverb
**Summary and Clarification: "Proverb"**

Proverbs are common sayings or clichés that people use to succinctly convey their feelings or beliefs about a situation. These sayings are a form of verbal shorthand that offers a glimpse into a person's worldview or principles. Some proverbs and their themes include:

- **Practicality**: "Handsome is as handsome does."
- **Sexual Equality**: "What's good for the goose is good for the gander."
- **Perseverance**: "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
- **Leniency**: "Spare the rod, spoil the child."
- **Compromise**: "To get along, you've got to go along."

For writers, integrating a character's use of a proverb can be a concise way to shed light on their core beliefs or attitudes about a particular subject.

**Summary and Clarification: "Extremism"**

**Extremism** refers to an individual's unyielding and fervent adherence to a particular philosophy or belief system, often to the exclusion of any other viewpoint. Such individuals typically view things strictly in black and white, labeling their own beliefs as "good" and anything opposing as "bad." They lack the capacity to see any middle ground or gray areas. They vehemently propagate their viewpoints, and can sometimes manifest as either tragic or comedic characters in literature. Three main types of extremists are the disciple, the dogmatist, and the fanatic:

1. **Disciple**:
   - Unquestioningly follows and promotes a particular doctrine or its leader.
   - Merges his identity with the group, becoming subservient to it.
   - His personality might undergo significant change due to his devotion.
   - Takes pride in his dedication and sacrifices for the "cause."

2. **Dogmatist**:
   - Similar to the disciple but reacts aggressively when his beliefs are challenged.
   - Very stubborn, rarely admitting fault.
   - Often tries to dominate conversations about his beliefs and shows little tolerance for dissenting opinions.
   - Is often looking for opportunities to strengthen and validate his convictions.

3. **Fanatic**:
   - Not just satisfied with personal conviction; strives to convert everyone to his viewpoint.
   - Extremely uncompromising: views matters as life-or-death.
   - His fervor makes him irrational, even to the point of risking his own life and those of others.
   - Exemplified by characters like zealots, anarchists, and radicals who are willing to make ultimate sacrifices for their cause.

In essence, extremism in a character is depicted by an unwavering, often irrational, commitment to a belief, leading to a rejection of reason and an inability to engage in balanced discussions.
## 7. What are the Character's Strengths, Weaknesses, and Habits?
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters' strengths, weaknesses, and habits are crucial in developing a narrative. Generally, primary traits drive the main plot, while secondary traits add depth and dimension to characters but might not have a significant impact on the story's direction.

For instance, in Shakespeare's "Othello", Iago's persuasive skills exploit Othello's gullibility, leading Othello to believe in his wife's infidelity. This primary trait is central to the plot. In contrast, the film "Rainman" offers a secondary trait: Dustin Hoffman's character is autistic with a unique ability to calculate large numbers instantly. Though this skill is utilized in a casino scene, the primary focus of the story is the evolving relationship between the brothers.

Typically, strengths are seen as positive attributes and weaknesses as negative. However, their perception can be subjective, varying based on the observer's perspective in the story. Depending on the narrative, one character might see another's strength as a weakness and vice versa. Regardless, any strength or weakness introduced should be relevant to the storyline. For instance, mentioning a character's photographic memory without ever demonstrating it in the story would be redundant.

In addition to strengths and weaknesses, habits also help in character building by providing authentic details that make characters more relatable and believable.

### STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

**Summary and Clarification: "Strengths and Weaknesses"**

**Strengths and Weaknesses** can be broadly categorized into two types: inherited (natural) and acquired (developed over time). 

1. **Inherited Strengths and Weaknesses**:
   - **Strengths**: Often seen as talents given at birth, they're unexplained and can evolve into significant skills. For instance, some people might naturally have an aptitude for music or art.
   - **Weaknesses**: Typically viewed as shortcomings or challenges due to genetics. Remarks like "You can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse" reflect societal attitudes towards such inherent weaknesses. For instance, someone might inherit a predisposition to certain health conditions.

2. **Acquired Strengths and Weaknesses**:
   - **Strengths**: Developed through effort and experience. The saying, "Practice makes perfect" embodies this concept. For instance, one becomes a skilled writer or athlete not by birthright but through consistent effort.
   - **Weaknesses**: Developed due to habits or exposure to certain situations. For example, an addiction or phobia might develop over time based on experiences or choices.

Considering the development of a fictional character, strengths and weaknesses can help make them distinct. They can be:
- **Physical**: Attributes related to the body, such as strength, agility, or physical vulnerabilities like poor eyesight.
- **Mental**: Pertains to cognitive abilities or challenges, including skills like problem-solving, memory, attention to detail, or weaknesses like forgetfulness.
- **Social**: Relates to interpersonal skills. A person could be charismatic, great at storytelling, or might struggle with social interactions, be awkward, or insensitive.

It's essential to consider these facets when creating a layered, believable character. The combination of strengths and weaknesses gives depth and makes a character relatable, driving the narrative in meaningful ways.

### HABITS
**Summary and Clarification: "Habits"**

**Habits** can be classified into two main types: voluntary and involuntary. 

1. **Voluntary Habits**:
   - These are intentional routines or practices that individuals follow regularly, even if there isn't a logical reason behind them.
   - They can lead to conflict when disrupted. For example, if two people in an apartment have the habit of using the washing machine at the same time, it might cause an argument.
   - Voluntary habits can provide insights into a character's personality and even influence a story's plot or direction.

2. **Involuntary Habits**:
   - These are unconscious behaviors that recur frequently.
   - They are often noticeable to others and can sometimes annoy or irritate them. Examples include unconsciously tapping fingers, clearing the throat often, or humming off-key.
   - In storytelling, these habits can introduce tension, humor, or character depth.

Regardless of the type, habits are not necessarily strengths or weaknesses but rather peculiarities that add dimension to a character. They can be leveraged in storytelling for comedic effect, to build tension, or to add depth and relatability to characters.
## 8. What is the Character's Background?
**Summary and Clarification:**

A character's background offers insights into their motivations, decisions, and behaviors within a story. Determining the significance of this background is vital.

## 9. What Is the Character's Self-Assessment?
**Summary and Clarification:**

A character's background is crucial for the audience's understanding of their motivations and actions. If key elements of a character's past are omitted, it could reduce the clarity and depth of that character in the story. For writers, a comprehensive grasp of a character's history can aid in creating a more authentic portrayal.

There are various methods to unveil a character's history, such as flashbacks, direct narrative, or subtle hints. The depth of this revelation hinges on its relevance to the plot and the writer's intention.

## 10. What is the Character's 'Type'?
**Summary and Clarification:**

The term "character type" often makes writers think of stereotypes, which can carry negative connotations. However, character types can serve as foundational blueprints for crafting unique and multifaceted characters. For instance, a writer may begin with a Scrooge-like archetype but evolve it into a character that differs significantly from Dickens's Scrooge. Similarly, influences from well-known characters like Huck Finn or Captain Bligh can be taken, adapted, and placed in entirely new contexts. The essential point is that while a character type might serve as an initial inspiration, it shouldn't restrict or oversimplify the character's development. It's a starting point, not the end goal. An archetype becomes a stereotype if the writer lacks the creativity to layer depth and nuance onto it. Characters can be multifaceted and might embody characteristics from multiple types, emphasizing the importance of not limiting them to a single mold.
## 11. Does the Character Have a Nickname?
**Summary and Clarification:**

Nicknames can be powerful tools in storytelling, providing insights into both the character who has the nickname and those who use it. While there are countless potential nicknames, it's essential to focus on what type best suits the character and the story. Often, a nickname reflects the attitudes or biases of those who coin and use it. For instance, derogatory nicknames based on physical appearance or nationality might hint at prejudice or cruelty from those using them. On the other hand, how a character feels about their nickname can also reveal aspects of their self-perception and emotional response. If they appreciate a nickname like "Ace," it may align with their self-image or past experiences. However, if they detest a nickname like "Rooster," it can evoke strong emotional reactions whenever it's used. In essence, when choosing a nickname for a character, a writer should consider both the intent behind the name and the character's feelings towards it.
## 12. What is the Character's Job?

**Summary and Clarification:**

The occupation of a character can be a significant aspect of their identity and story. It's essential for readers or viewers to believe that the character's job aligns with their personality or background, ensuring the story remains credible. While a character might not always be good at their job, like an inept family member put in charge of a family business, the key is for the profession to seem plausible given the character's background and context. Assigning a character an occupation that doesn't align with their personality or backstory might jeopardize their believability. The author mentions a range of job categories, including crime, to help writers choose a suitable profession for their characters, emphasizing the vast options available.
## 13. Will the Character Face a Nonhuman Adversary?
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters in a story may face challenges or opposition from nonhuman adversaries. These adversaries can help reveal a character's true nature, as they force the character to respond in various ways, such as fighting back, negotiating, seeking assistance, showing anger, fleeing, or resigning to the situation. An adversary doesn't necessarily need to be visible or audible; their impact can be felt through the danger, difficulty, or emotional distress they bring. Sometimes, these nonhuman threats can be the primary antagonists, like the shark in the movie "Jaws". However, often, they serve as secondary challenges within a narrative. When incorporating a nonhuman adversary, writers should consider its role in the plot, its duration in the story, its impact on the characters, and the actions it compels characters to take. This chapter aims to outline various nonhuman adversaries that can help illuminate a character's essence and reactions.
## 14. What Plot Drivers Will Affect the Character?
**Summary and Clarification:**

A plot driver is an element in a story that pushes the narrative forward, prompting readers or viewers to wonder about upcoming events. While sometimes a singular plot driver suffices, other stories might require multiple plot drivers that can result from one another. These drivers create action and provoke reactions, rather than emotions. Some traits might seem like plot drivers, such as jealousy or courage, but they are usually responses to events rather than the events themselves. For instance, jealousy might arise because of a character's actions or perceived actions, making the action the real driver. However, certain drivers, like acts of kindness or unkindness, are perceived based on the recipient's viewpoint. Some plot drivers may have taken place before the story starts, like in "Hamlet" where prior events like the king's death and the queen's remarriage set the stage. Ideally, a plot driver reveals the character's internal traits or prompts them to take action, showcasing their strengths, weaknesses, desires, or fears. This chapter doesn't aim to list every possible plot driver but to categorize major types for writers to explore. A significant theme here is that adversity is a primary driver in storytelling. Out of 49 plot driver categories discussed in this chapter, the majority revolve around adversity, emphasizing that conflict and challenges are essential in captivating narratives.
