#03_CHARACTER 

> **03 CHARACTER** - A character refers to an individual or entity that is part of the story and plays a role in advancing the narrative. Characters are the driving force behind the events, conflicts, and emotions that unfold in the fictional world. They can be human, non-human (such as animals or supernatural beings), or even inanimate objects (personified entities). Each character possesses unique traits, personalities, motivations, and backgrounds that contribute to their distinct role within the story.

**Character is not created in isolation or repose; itâ€™s forged through *interaction with others and the world.*** - STENDHAL

# Character - Body of Knowledge

## Character_Cornerstones
The authors found in this category represent the cornerstones of my personal theory of composition. 5? Masters of the craft each which represent their own robust theory on creating character. 
Each can be used independently or in cooperation with each other. The idea for now is to limit myself to these 5 authors when crafting my own personal character theory. 

### Character The Art of Role and Cast Design for Page, Stage, and Screen - MCKEE, ROBERT
McKee's entire methodology and theory when it comes to intertextual storytelling is based on the concept of duality. The idea of polar opposites are what govern drama, dilemma, and tragedy. The impossible decisions, contradictions, perceptions that we embody as consciousnesses against the immovable reality of the world in which we are forced adapt and change with. 
*The genius of McKee is in the simplicity of his design theory. Duality and the infinite spectrum between provides constraints to the infinity that is relentless creativity. At any point of the creative writing process, McKee is the tool to always reach for first. Salt to culinary.*
### Creating Compelling Characters for Film, TV, Theatre and Radio - DAVIS, RIB
Davis explicitly states that his writings are not of a prescriptive nature. EG: Steps to character. Rather, Davis theorizes on the nature of character and characterization. He believes that character is an organism of evolving relationships that can adapt according to the needs of the author. What has worked, why, and why it might not again. He places the onus of decision making on the author. Concisely, Davis' approach to character is that of a craft. A pursuit of aesthetics guided by principles and refinement. 
*Davis is the wind in the sails and the stars in the sky. When all else fails, his pontifications can be used as a troubleshooting guide or a reminder that as the author, I decide write and wrong.*

### The Art of Character - CORBETT, DAVID
Corbett focuses on a wholistic approach of characterization that prioritizes the use of memory thru scenes. He breaks up the development of character into three steps: 
	- 1 conception
	- 2 development
	- 3 portrayal
*Corbett provides a solid theory, architecture, and method for developing character. For now, it seems that his approach will serve as the cornerstone in which all others will fall under*

## The Psychology Workbook for Writers - SMITH, DARIAN
Smith focuses on an academic psychological approach using applied theories used in counselling. Her approach designates *personality*, *human interaction*, *conflict*, and *self-sabotage*, as key identifiers for well developed characters. 
*Smith provides a very practical methodology that is backed up by science and experience. Its primary strength is its theoretical framework of establishing trauma in theory. Using Smith can help reinforce characterization in line with Corbett. 
Since Corbett focuses on scenic depth that is experienced by the reader, perhaps Smith can assist in creating a framework for the author to audit or verify the believability of a character's arch.*

## The Coffee Break Screenwriter - ALESSANDRA, PILAR
Alessandra focuses on a simple methodology that provides a step-to-step guide on rapidly developing a story for screen or television. 
*Alessandra was my first real book on writing that made sense to me. I can reference her whenever I need a guide to what I need to accomplish next in the writing process. She uses a multitude of theories behind each step in her process, however, I seek to know story beyond the simplicity provided in her method. Though that does not retract her ability to provide an approach that is simple and that works.*
