#03_CHARACTER 

> **03 CHARACTER** - A character refers to an individual or entity that is part of the story and plays a role in advancing the narrative. Characters are the driving force behind the events, conflicts, and emotions that unfold in the fictional world. They can be human, non-human (such as animals or supernatural beings), or even inanimate objects (personified entities). Each character possesses unique traits, personalities, motivations, and backgrounds that contribute to their distinct role within the story.

**Character is not created in isolation or repose; itâ€™s forged through *interaction with others and the world.*** - STENDHAL

# Character - Body of Knowledge

## Character Cornerstones
The authors found in this category represent the cornerstones of my personal theory of composition. 5? Masters of the craft each which represent their own robust theory on creating character. 
Each can be used independently or in cooperation with each other. The idea for now is to limit myself to these 5 authors when crafting my own personal character theory. 

### 03_The Art of Character - CORBETT, DAVID
Corbett focuses on a wholistic approach of characterization that prioritizes the use of memory thru scenes. He breaks up the development of character into three steps: 
	- 1 conception
	- 2 development
	- 3 portrayal
*Corbett provides a solid theory, architecture, and method for developing character. For now, it seems that his approach will serve as the cornerstone in which all others will fall under*

### 03_The Compass of Character - CORBETT, DAVID
Corbett picks up with where The Art of Character leaves off, focusing wholly on the most important part of his character theory, motivation and desire. 
*The Art of Character, and The Compass of Character together is a solid theory and methodology of Character. Corbett, in general, should be thought of the most important of all character cornerstones because his theory serves as a bridge  between theory and practice.*

### 03_Creating Compelling Characters for Film, TV, Theatre and Radio - DAVIS, RIB
Davis explicitly states that his writings are not of a prescriptive nature. EG: Steps to character. Rather, Davis theorizes on the nature of character and characterization. He believes that character is an organism of evolving relationships that can adapt according to the needs of the author. What has worked, why, and why it might not again. He places the onus of decision making on the author. Concisely, Davis' approach to character is that of a craft. A pursuit of aesthetics guided by principles and refinement. 
*Davis is the wind in the sails and the stars in the sky. When all else fails, his pontifications can be used as a troubleshooting guide or a reminder that as the author, I decide write and wrong.*

### 03_Creating Characters - LAUTHER, HOWARD
Lauther's character theory aligns with contemporary understanding. In his view, character resembles a database form where every aspect, when completed, results in a fully developed character. Lauther's approach is straightforward, making it valuable for designing characters across different artistic forms.
*I find Lauther's approach particularly effective for adapting intricate characters across different media. Although its design is uncomplicated, it incorporates depth, enabling a seamless transition of characters from literary to visual formats.*

### 03_Character The Art of Role and Cast Design for Page, Stage, and Screen - MCKEE, ROBERT
McKee's entire methodology and theory when it comes to intertextual storytelling is based on the concept of duality. The idea of polar opposites are what govern drama, dilemma, and tragedy. The impossible decisions, contradictions, perceptions that we embody as consciousnesses against the immovable reality of the world in which we are forced adapt and change with. 
*The genius of McKee is in the simplicity of his design theory. **Duality** and the infinite spectrum between provides constraints to the infinity that is relentless creativity. At any point of the creative writing process, McKee is the tool to always reach for first. Salt to culinary.*

### 03_The Psychology Workbook for Writers - SMITH, DARIAN
Smith focuses on an academic psychological approach using applied theories used in counselling. Her approach designates *personality*, *human interaction*, *conflict*, and *self-sabotage*, as key identifiers for well developed characters. 
*Smith provides a very practical methodology that is backed up by science and experience. Its primary strength is its theoretical framework of establishing trauma in theory. Using Smith can help reinforce characterization in line with Corbett. 
Since Corbett focuses on scenic depth that is experienced by the reader, perhaps Smith can assist in creating a framework for the author to audit or verify the believability of a character's arch.*
