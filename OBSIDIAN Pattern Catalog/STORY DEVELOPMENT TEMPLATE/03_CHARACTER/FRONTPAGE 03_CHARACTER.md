#03_CHARACTER 

> **03 CHARACTER** - A character refers to an individual or entity that is part of the story and plays a role in advancing the narrative. Characters are the driving force behind the events, conflicts, and emotions that unfold in the fictional world. They can be human, non-human (such as animals or supernatural beings), or even inanimate objects (personified entities). Each character possesses unique traits, personalities, motivations, and backgrounds that contribute to their distinct role within the story.

**Character is not created in isolation or repose; itâ€™s forged through *interaction with others and the world.*** - STENDHAL
# The Art of Character - CORBETT, DAVID
Corbett focuses on a wholistic approach of characterization that prioritizes the use of memory thru scenes. He breaks up the development of character into three steps: 
	- 1 conception
	- 2 development
	- 3 portrayal

*Corbett provides a solid theory, architecture, and method for developing character. For now, it seems that his approach will serve as the cornerstone in which all others will fall under*

# The Psychology Workbook for Writers - SMITH, DARIAN
Smith focuses on an academic psychological approach using applied theories used in counselling. Her approach designates *personality*, *human interaction*, *conflict*, and *self-sabotage*, as key identifiers for well developed characters. 

*Smith provides a very practical methodology that is backed up by science and experience. Its primary strength is its theoretical framework of establishing trauma in theory. Using Smith can help reinforce characterization in line with Corbett. 
Since Corbett focuses on scenic depth that is experienced by the reader, perhaps Smith can assist in creating a framework for the author to audit or verify the believability of a character's arch.*

# The Coffee Break Screenwriter - ALESSANDRA, PILAR
Alessandra focuses on a simple methodology that provides a step-to-step guide on rapidly developing a story for screen or television. 

*Alessandra was my first real book on writing that made sense to me. I can reference her whenever I need a guide to what I need to accomplish next in the writing process. She uses a multitude of theories behind each step in her process, however, I seek to know story beyond the simplicity provided in her method. Though that does not retract her ability to provide an approach that is simple and that works.*
