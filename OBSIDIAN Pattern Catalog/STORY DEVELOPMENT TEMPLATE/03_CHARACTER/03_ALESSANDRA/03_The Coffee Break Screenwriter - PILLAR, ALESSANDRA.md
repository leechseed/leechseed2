# INTRODUCTION
This book will help you use your stolen ten minutes of time to make real progress on your screenplay . Each chapter focuses on a different phase of the writing process: THE STORY, THE STRUCTURE, THE OUTLINE, THE CHARACTERS, THE FIRST DRAFT, THE DIALOGUE, THE REWRITE, THE CRAFT, THE FINAL EDIT, THE PRESENTATION, and THE OPPORTUNITY. 

Within these chapters there are subsections to help you work through each phase. As you move through, you’ll also see “Take Ten” writing tools and exercises. These have been created to help you move through the writing process quickly and efficiently , ten minutes at a time. When a “Take Ten” exercise comes up, try it out. Not every tool is going to work for every writer. But you should be able to find at least one new thing that will help you to brainstorm, outline, expand or polish your script. 

At the end of each “Take Ten” exercise, you’ll see a summary of “What You’ve Accomplished.” This should remind you that you actually have moved forward in your story — despite the short amount of time in which you’ve worked. “You’ve finished something,” they’ll say. “So don’t go back and make it perfect. Turn the page and do something else!” 

And, from time to time, you’ll also come across a “Ten-Minute Lecture.” These are meant to quickly distill and demystify current screenplay theory or common screenwriting language. 

If you’re just beginning a new project, I’d suggest following along chronologically, using the book to build your story from concept to finished script. Even if you’ve already written a screenplay, you’ll find outlining tools and writing tips that will streamline your process. 

If you’re a writer who only needs help with certain areas of your script, feel free to jump from chapter to chapter . Even skipping around, you should find a writing tool that will work for you

It’s up to you. All I can tell you is that time is wasting, so start writing! You’ve only got ... well, you know!

> *This exercise aims to generate narratives in a scalable manner. However, the main problem lies in its inability to clearly define the character's scope. Properly answering this question requires initial understanding of the scale at which the story's queries should be approached - whether at a detailed, localized scale or at a larger, more comprehensive story scale. When considering the grand story scale, the challenge is the limited data available to establish the story's bounds. Therefore, it would be more practical to select a scale size that seems the most convenient. Once you've established this foundational overview, you can incrementally build upon it to achieve the desired scale.*

## Your Turn
### EMOTION + ACTION = STORY
*Set your main character off on an active, emotional journey by asking the following questions:*  

	In the beginning of my story, this event occurs:
==...==

	It makes my main character (MC) feel this way:
==...==

	So he does this: 
==...==

	But that makes someone else do this:
==...==

	That event makes MC feel:
==...==

	So MC does this:
==...==
 
Keep asking these questions and see how much story you can invent in 10 minutes.
