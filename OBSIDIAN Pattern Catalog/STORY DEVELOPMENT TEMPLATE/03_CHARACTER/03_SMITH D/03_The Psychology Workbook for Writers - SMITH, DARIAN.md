#03_CHARACTER 
# Introduction
**Summary:**

The author believes that writing and psychology are deeply intertwined. Good writers often have an innate understanding of human nature, which they incorporate into their characters and stories. Although this insight can come naturally or through experience, grounding in psychological theories can fast-track the creation of compelling characters and narratives. Drawing from their background in psychology, English literature, and counselling, the author has recognized the importance of robust characters in engaging the reader. In their novel, "Currents of Change", they applied psychological insights, earning praise for strong character development.

In the upcoming book, the author plans to present various counselling and psychological theories that can benefit writers. These theories, which are used by therapists to understand human behavior, can be instrumental in crafting realistic characters. The book will explain these concepts in layman's terms, offer examples from popular literature and movies, and provide worksheets to help writers integrate the theories into their own work. While writers already acquainted with their characters can benefit from a deeper understanding, the book's primary goal is to guide writers in creating problems for their characters, driving the story's conflict. The content is strictly for crafting fiction and should not be used for personal therapy or applied to real-life situations. The author encourages writers to experiment with the theories, adopt what resonates, and discard what doesn't to enhance their storytelling.

# Blame the Parents
**Summary:**

Psychology often underscores the impact of early-life influences, especially from parents, in shaping our behaviors and beliefs. While therapists aim to identify the root causes of an individual's issues without placing blame, writers can use this understanding to deepen their characters' backgrounds and motivations. The counseling theory, Transactional Analysis, categorizes these early-life messages into two types: Injunctions (negative subconscious cues) and Drivers (positive guiding cues).

Injunctions are the "don'ts", suggesting a character is not okay if they indulge in certain behaviors or emotions. Examples include messages that tell a character not to express their emotions, not to be themselves, or that they don't belong. Drivers, conversely, are positive messages that encourage characters to behave in specific ways to gain acceptance, such as trying hard, being perfect, or pleasing others. These messages can become burdens if they're viewed as absolutes, leading to internal conflict within characters. 

A compelling character journey can be crafted by integrating a mix of these injunctions and drivers, creating a psychological tug of war. An example of this is Princess Elsa from "Frozen", who grapples with negative injunctions from her past, such as not showing her true self or her powers. Only when she reevaluates and overcomes these early-life messages can she truly embrace herself and her abilities.

The book "TA Today" by Ian Stewart and Vann Joines further explores this concept.
# Flip the Script

**Summary:**

**Flip The Script Theory in Storytelling**

*Concept:* 
The "Flip The Script" theory emphasizes the impact of early developmental messages on an individual's worldview and behaviors. In Transactional Analysis, this process is referred to as life scripting. These internalized scripts influence a person’s perception and reaction to real-world events, often based more on their existing beliefs than on the actual happenings.

*Key Points:*

1. **Life Scripting**: Decisions made about the world based on childhood messages can lock into a person's mind, often becoming challenging to change. People tend to behave in line with their scripts, sometimes neglecting real-world events that contradict their ingrained beliefs.

2. **Expectation & Perception**: People see and recall events based on their expectations. For example, those who believe they are lucky notice opportunities, while those who feel they are unlucky notice obstacles.

3. **Character Behaviors**: The reactions of fictional characters to story events are deeply rooted in their internal life scripts. A character's journey could involve challenging these internalized beliefs, producing internal and external conflicts in the narrative.

4. **Common Life Script Themes** (as presented in "TA Today" by Ian Stewart and Vann Joines):
    - **Until**: Belief that something positive will only occur after a less favorable event.
    - **After**: A current joy will lead to future pain.
    - **Never**: A desired outcome will never happen.
    - **Always**: Repeated patterns in outcomes.
    - **Almost**: Goals are almost reached but never fully attained.
    - **Open-ended**: Uncertainty about future steps after reaching a specific point.

5. **Narrative Therapy**: This therapy type believes that people's perceptions and behaviors are influenced by the stories they tell themselves about their experiences. By changing or refocusing the narrative, individuals can alter their beliefs and, subsequently, their actions.

*Examples:*
- **Cinderella**: Represents the "Until" script where she believes her life will only improve when she's rescued after enduring suffering.
- **Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones**: Embodies the "Never" script, believing he will never earn his father's love, leading him to a life of debauchery.

*Further Reading*: 
"TA Today" by Ian Stewart and Vann Joines, 1987; "What is Narrative Therapy" by Alice Morgan, 2000. 

This theory offers a comprehensive framework for writers to craft believable characters, as understanding and effectively employing a character's life script can deeply enrich narrative complexity and engagement.

# Pieces of Me

**Summary**

**Systemic Theory in Personality and Character Development**

* **Basic Concept:** Systemic Theory posits that every individual is a part of a vast bio-psycho-social system, which means our behaviors are linked to the environment and the people around us. We influence others, and they influence us. For instance, individual behaviors accumulate to establish societal norms, which further affect the environment, and these environmental changes, in turn, affect us.

* **Internal Systems:** Each individual comprises various internal systems or parts that can sometimes conflict. For instance, someone needing to give a public speech might have a part that's scared of public speaking and another part confident in their preparation. The resultant action or behavior is a culmination of which 'part' dominates.

* **Therapeutic Application:** Therapists use this concept to understand different parts of an individual. By recognizing these parts, and understanding their positive intentions (despite possibly negative outcomes), an individual can become more in control of their actions and feelings.

* **Implication for Writers:** This theory aids writers in developing multidimensional characters. A character may be influenced by various parts of their personality, leading to internal conflict, growth, and change. Villains, for instance, aren't just evil but are motivated by parts of them that want love, safety, or power.

* **Example:** In the film "Notting Hill", Anna Scott, a celebrity, loves the limelight but also desires normalcy. When confronted with chauvinistic comments, different parts of her battle between confronting and ignoring the remarks. Her choice to confront reflects the domination of her strong-willed and witty parts.

* **Further Reading:** For a deeper understanding, one can refer to "Metaframeworks" by Breunlin, Schwartz, and Mac Kune-Karrer and "An Introduction to Family Therapy" by Dallos and Draper.
# All's Fair in Love and War
**Summary:**

**ALL’S FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR**

**The Theory:**
1. **Relationship Dynamics:** Relationships are central to stories. While plots are pivotal, it's the dynamic between characters that captivates readers.
2. **Opposites Attract:** Literary works often portray opposites attracting, primarily because such dynamics introduce conflict which fuels the narrative.
3. **Communication:** Good relationships hinge on open communication, but for writers, miscommunication can create intrigue and tension in the storyline.
4. **Mirroring:** In relationship therapy, mirroring ensures clear communication. In literature, mirroring can signify a deep empathic bond between characters or be a catalyst for conflict.

**Key Relationship Aspects:**
1. **Love Languages:** Proposed by Gary Chapman, the Five Love Languages theory explains how people express love differently: through Words, Acts of Service, Physical Affection, Gifts, or Quality Time. Mismatched love languages can be a rich source of conflict in stories.
2. **The Four Horsemen:** Based on John Gottman's research, these are critical behaviors that signal relationship troubles. They are Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling. Writers can leverage these behaviors to depict strained relationships.

**Example:**
- In Jane Austen’s "Pride and Prejudice", Mr. Darcy's initial lack of eloquence contrasts Elizabeth's proficiency with words. However, his acts of service and potential gifts signify his love, making their dynamic more nuanced.

**Suggested Further Reading:** 
1. "The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts" by Gary Chapman.
2. "The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work" by John Gottman and Nan Silver.

# There's No Place Like Home
**Summary:**

**THERE’S NO PLACE LIKE HOME (WITH THE FAMILY): A Systemic Approach**

The systemic approach to therapy focuses on understanding individuals as part of interdependent systems, such as families. Within these systems, each member's actions influence the others and the entire dynamic. For instance, a young adult might want to move out, but stays because of parental loneliness. The familial dynamic creates both support and constraint, and this balance is crucial for stories, as it provides context for a character's behavior.

- **Homeostasis:** Systems resist change to maintain equilibrium. For example, if someone starts to lose weight, friends might subconsciously try to sabotage their efforts to maintain the familiar dynamic. This concept is key in storytelling, as protagonists often have to challenge the status quo, resulting in resistance from their familiar systems.

- **Triangulation:** A psychological bonding technique where two parties bond over a mutual third party or enemy. It's a classic story mechanism to make unfriendly characters unite against a common adversary.

In *Game of Thrones*, both the Stark and Lannister families exemplify these systemic dynamics. The Lannisters, in particular, have defined roles within their family, and any deviation from these roles results in a pushback from the rest of the family members, ensuring everyone remains in their assigned place.

*Recommended Readings:* For a deeper dive into systemic family therapy and its principles, "Metaframeworks" by Breunlin, Schwartz, and Mac Kune-Karrer, and "An Introduction to Family Therapy" by Dallos and Draper are recommended.
# State of Being
**Summary:**

**STATE OF BEING: Ego States and Drama Triangle in Transactional Analysis**

**Ego States in Transactional Analysis:**
Transactional Analysis (TA) proposes that personalities can be viewed through three ego states:

1. **Parent**: This is the internalized voice of our parents or primary caregivers. It can be nurturing, offering care and guidance, or critical, reprimanding or giving rules. Examples include advice like “Look both ways when you cross the road.”
2. **Adult**: The adult ego state is rational, logical, and operates in the present moment. It's useful for solving problems and making assessments based on evidence.
3. **Child**: This represents our behaviors from childhood. The child can be playful and fun (Free Child) or can adapt according to societal rules (Adapted Child).

Our interactions with others often depend on these ego states, and we can switch between them throughout the day. For instance, if confronted by someone in a Parent state, an individual might respond from their Child state.

**Drama Triangle in TA**:
The Drama Triangle describes three roles individuals may take on:

1. **Victim**: Feels oppressed and seeks rescuing.
2. **Persecutor**: Aggresses or oppresses the victim.
3. **Rescuer**: Steps in to help the victim.

Dramatic tension rises as characters shift roles within this triangle. For instance, a victim might lash out at a rescuer, becoming the persecutor, while the rescuer becomes the new victim.

**Examples**:
- In *Love Actually*, Daniel and his stepson, Sam, frequently transition between Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, reflecting their evolving relationship.
- In *Bridget Jones’s Diary*, the dynamic between Bridget, Daniel Cleaver, and Mark Darcy exemplifies the Drama Triangle, with shifts in roles bringing about conflict and drama.

*Recommended Reading*: "TA Today" by Ian Stewart and Vann Joines provides an in-depth understanding of Transactional Analysis.
# Conflict of Interest
**Summary:**

**Understanding Conflict in Storytelling: Styles and Escalation**

**The Role of Conflict:**
Conflict is crucial in storytelling, helping drive the narrative. Authors must understand character reactions to conflict, methods to intensify it, and its timely resolution.

**Responses to Conflict**:
People typically react to conflict through:
1. **Fight or Flight**: They either confront the situation (fight) or evade it (flight).
2. **Freeze**: Some choose to remain inactive and hope the conflict dissipates.

**Three Basic Styles to Address Conflict**:
1. **Submit**: Yielding to the other's demands.
2. **Use Logic**: Offering a well-thought-out argument to support their viewpoint.
3. **Get Angry**: Being aggressive in an attempt to dominate.

Individuals generally have a preferred sequence for these styles, and escalation happens when they shift from one style to another. For instance, someone who turns to anger as a last resort will exhibit more intense anger than someone who uses it as their primary response. Conversely, those who submit as their final option are relinquishing something vital, leading to profound despair.

**For Writers**: 
To enhance conflict, assign characters opposing conflict styles. Intensify the narrative by making characters move through their conflict sequences, thereby increasing the story's tension as characters grow more engrossed in their disputes.

**Example from Literature**:
In *Pride and Prejudice*, Elizabeth Bennet's conflict pattern is: submission, logic, anger. For trivial matters, especially with loved ones, Elizabeth might overlook issues. With more significant concerns, she employs logic, which often works with her father. Yet, when pushed to her limits, Elizabeth will express her anger, even if her opponent is as formidable as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
# Personality Plus
**Summary:**

**Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and Character Development**

**The Theory:**
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a popular tool to determine personality types. It consists of four scales or continuums, leading to specific personality types. For writers, MBTI can help understand characters and cultivate conflict by juxtaposing characters with opposing traits.

**The Four Scales:**
1. **Introvert vs. Extrovert**: 
    * **Introverts** prefer solitude to recharge and value deeper friendships, whereas **Extroverts** gain energy from social interactions and often have a broader circle of friends.
    * In crises, an extrovert might seek social interactions, while an introvert might desire solitude.

2. **Sensing vs. Intuition**:
    * **Sensing** individuals rely on tangible evidence and concrete information. 
    * **Intuitive** people discern patterns and make connections even when direct evidence is lacking. They understand overarching principles.

3. **Thinking vs. Feeling**:
    * **Thinkers** prioritize logic in decision-making, while **Feelers** emphasize emotions.
    * A thinker might buy a house based on practical considerations, whereas a feeler might choose based on emotional connection.

4. **Judging vs. Perception**:
    * **Judgers** prefer planning ahead and sticking to it. They struggle when needing to adapt.
    * **Perceivers** are more spontaneous, often improvising and are adaptable to changing situations.

**Example in Film**:
In *Beauty and the Beast*, Belle exemplifies introversion with her love for books and introspective nature. Gaston, conversely, embodies extroversion with his loud and attention-seeking demeanor. Their contrasting personalities create dramatic tension.

**Further Exploration**:

# Giving Greif
**Summary:**

**Understanding Grief in Storytelling**

**The Theory:**
Grief is a complex emotional response not solely tied to death but can arise from any form of loss. Its portrayal in literature is often limited due to its emotionally intense nature, which may decelerate the story’s pace. However, an authentic character portrayal often requires addressing grief. While there are typical reactions to grief, like anger or substance abuse, they have become clichéd in literature. Realistically, grief comprises various stages, although they aren't strictly linear.

**Stages of Grief**:
1. **Shock/Denial**: Initial disbelief regarding the loss.
2. **Physical Reaction**: Physical symptoms like shivering or weakness.
3. **Emotional Response**: Outbursts of crying or intense sorrow.
4. **Anger**: Frustration and resentment towards the situation or others.
5. **Idealisation**: Overemphasizing the positive aspects of what's lost.
6. **Guilt**: Believing one is responsible for the loss.
7. **Behavioural Issues**: Manifesting grief through disruptive actions.
8. **Realisation**: Recognizing the lost entity's imperfections.
9. **Learn New Ways of Being**: Adapting to life without the lost entity.
10. **Find a New Place in the World**: Re-establishing one's identity post-loss.
11. **Acceptance**: Embracing the new reality without the lost entity.

**Example in Fiction**:
In the story "Spring" from the collection *Shifting Worlds*, the protagonists grapple with the immediate shock and denial from a sudden tragedy. Although the narrative doesn’t showcase an overt emotional breakdown, the profound sense of disbelief is conveyed through altered perceptions of time, environmental details, and poignant metaphors.

**Recommended Reading**:
For an in-depth study on grief, consider "On Grief and Grieving" by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, published by Scribner in its 2014 Reprint edition.
# There's a Little Bit in All of Us
**Summary:**

**Understanding Psychological Traits in Character Development**

**The Theory:**
Everyone possesses traits that, in their extreme forms, resemble psychological disorders. These traits are usually benign and only become problematic when they impair daily functioning. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory can help identify potential psychological challenges in an individual. For writers, considering these traits in characters can make them more realistic and multi-dimensional.

**Traits and Potential Disorders:**
1. **Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**: A mild tendency for cleanliness can, at an extreme, evolve into obsessive rituals and phobias.
2. **Depression**: A mild inclination to feel down can, in its severe form, manifest as severe sadness, motivation loss, and suicidal thoughts.
3. **Anxiety**: Being a slight worrier in mild cases can escalate to severe anxiety symptoms like panic attacks in extreme cases.
4. **Bipolar**: Mild mood swings can lead to episodes of severe depression and heightened mania.
5. **Hypochondria**: Overconsciousness about health can, at an extreme, result in unwarranted fear of severe illnesses.
6. **Paranoia**: Being safety conscious can escalate to distrust and imagined threats.
7. **Anorexia**: A mild focus on calorie counting can lead to extreme meal skipping and malnutrition.
8. **Bulimia**: Comfort eating in moderation can lead to binge eating and purging when extreme.
9. **Schizophrenia**: A belief in the mystical or slight social isolation can turn into delusions and hallucinations.

**Example in Popular Media**:
In the TV series "Friends," Monica exhibits mild traits on the OCD and Bulimia spectrums. She has a penchant for control and cleaning, especially when stressed, and she previously struggled with weight. While her tendencies are within the normal range, they could be intensified in a dramatic setting.

**Recommendation for Writers**:
If considering giving a character a pronounced disorder, thorough research is essential to avoid perpetuating misconceptions about mental health. The DSM-5 provides detailed information on diagnosing and categorizing psychological disorders.

**Suggested Reading**:
"DSM-5 Insanely Simplified" by Steven Buser M.D., Chiron Publications, 2015 provides insights into psychological disorders.
# Me and My Shadow
**Summary:**

**The Shadow Self in Character Development**

**The Theory:**
Everyone possesses hidden traits or aspects of their personality that they might be ashamed of or unaware of. Coined by Carl Jung, the "shadow self" represents these dark, concealed parts of our psyche. For writers, understanding a character's shadow is crucial to creating a multi-dimensional and realistic portrayal. While characters may not recognize their shadow, it's the writer's responsibility to subtly reveal it. This shadow often manifests in traits that a character vehemently dislikes in others, a psychological phenomenon called "projection."

**Example in Literature**:
In the novel "Currents of Change," Moana is a character with deep-rooted responsibilities in her community. She actively opposes racism. However, when she meets Sara, Moana prematurely judges her based on her family name, revealing a hint of prejudice. This bias, which Moana condemns in others, is a part of her shadow. As the story unfolds, Moana grapples with recognizing this trait within herself and either addressing it or justifying her initial judgment.

**Advice for Writers**:
It's essential to introspect on the hidden qualities a character might possess. Displaying these qualities without the character's awareness, and considering who they might project these traits onto, can add depth to their portrayal.

**Recommended Reading**:
For a deeper understanding of the shadow concept, "Owning Your Own Shadow: Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche" by Robert A. Johnson, HarperOne reprint edition, 2013, offers valuable insights.
