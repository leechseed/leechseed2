#03_CHARACTER 

# INTRODUCTION

**Character’s primary purpose is to enrich your insights into the nature of the fictional character** and sharpen your creative techniques as you invent a complex, never-seen before cast of personalities, starting with your protagonist, then moving outward through your first, second, and third circles of supporting roles, ending with the nameless passing at the far edges of episodes.

In the chapters that follow, the principle of contradiction underpins virtually every lesson in character design. I play opposites against each other: characters versus human beings, institutions versus individuals, traits versus truths, the outer life versus the inner life, and so on. You and I know, of course, that along any spectrum strung between polar extremes, shades of possibility blur into overlaps and admixtures. But for clear, facile perception of character complexity, a writer needs a sensitivity to contrast and paradox, an eye for contradiction that unearths the full range of creative possibility. This book teaches that skill.

Characters taken from all eras serve two purposes: (1) The task of an illustration is to exemplify and clarify the point at hand, and, as it happens, the sharpest example is often history’s first. (2) I want you to take pride in your profession. As you write, you join an ancient, noble, truth telling tradition. Brilliant casts from the past will set the stage for your future writings.

Character has four parts. 
**Part One: In Praise of Characters** (Chapters One through Three) explores sources of inspiration for character invention and lays out the foundational work that shapes your talents toward creating superbly imagined fictional human beings. 
**Part Two: Building a Character** (Chapters Four through Thirteen) pursues the creation of never-met-before characters, beginning with methods from the outside in, followed by the inside out, expanding into dimensionality and complexity, ending with roles at their most radical. As Somerset Maugham expressed it, “The only inexhaustible subject is human nature.” 
**Part Three: The Character Universe** (Chapters Fourteen through Sixteen) contexts character by genre, performance, and reader/audience/character relationships. 
**Part Four: Character Relationships** (Chapter Seventeen) illustrates the principles and techniques of cast design by mapping the dramatis personae of five works taken from prose, cinema, theatre, and longform television. 

All told, I will parse the universe of character into its galaxies, galaxies into solar systems, solar systems into planets, planets into ecologies, ecologies into the life force all in order to help you uncover creative meanings in the human mystery. 


**PART ONE: IN PRAISE OF CHARACTERS**
# **PART ONE: IN PRAISE OF CHARACTERS**
*Characters from stories and literature significantly influence our lives, sometimes even more than real-life individuals. They serve as guides and provide insights into understanding ourselves and others. The upcoming chapters will explore human nature and the principles of storytelling. The first chapter specifically focuses on the distinctions between fictional characters and real people.*
# 1 CHARACTER VERSUS PEOPLE

Human beings and characters are distinct in their nature and existence. While humans are constantly evolving and changing, characters are stable and fixed in their narratives. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

- **Nature and Growth**:
    - Humans are continuously evolving and adapting, making them unpredictable.
    - Characters, once defined in their narrative, remain consistent and do not evolve beyond the climax of their story.
      
- **Impact**:
    - Humans affect us in straightforward, direct ways.
    - Characters indirectly influence us by seeping into our imaginations.
      
- **Existence**:
    - Humans live in the real world with multifaceted lives and representations.
    - Characters exist within their stories, symbols of broader human experiences, making them metaphoric but unique in their portrayal.
      
- **Permanence**:
    - Humans are mortal; their lives end with their passing.
    - Characters can transition from one narrative to another, as seen with characters like Jimmy McGill and Jesse Pinkman from the "Breaking Bad" universe.
      
- **Actors vs. Characters**:
    - There's a distinction between actors and the characters they portray. While actors might not inspire people in their everyday lives, their characters can deeply resonate with audiences. This difference exists because characters are crafted to fully express their experiences, making them more accessible and memorable.
      
- **Expression**:
    - Humans often internalize their experiences, sharing only a fraction of what they feel or undergo.
    - Characters, in contrast, are designed to display every emotion, experience, and thought, making them multidimensional and layered.
- **Duration of Existence**:
    - Humans have lifespans determined by fate and time, living each moment of their days.
    - Characters come to life within the confines of a narrative — when a book is read, a play is performed, or a film is viewed. Their existence is bound by the start and end of their story.
    
- **Desire**:
    - If characters could experience the real world, they'd likely opt-out of their fictional existence due to the challenges and suffering they often endure.

In essence, while humans and characters might share certain emotional and psychological attributes, their existence, impact, and representation are fundamentally different. Characters provide a focused lens into the human experience, making them more accessible and resonant than the often complex and guarded lives of real people.

## CHARACTER AND INSIGHT
**Summary and Clarification**:
Characters in literature and media provide readers and viewers with a unique opportunity to analyze and understand them deeply. Here's a breakdown:

- **Insight into Characters**:
    
    - Characters don't change or move in real-time, unlike real people. This static nature allows us to dissect their actions, words, and intentions.
    - As we engage with characters, it feels as though we can penetrate their outer actions and words, delving deep into their hidden thoughts, desires, and even their subconscious.
- **Self Reflection**:
    
    - When we introspect, accessing our own subconscious or understanding our true nature can be challenging. This often leaves us with questions about who we truly are.
    - Robert Burns's quote highlights this challenge, expressing a wish to see ourselves objectively, as others see us.
- **Character Analysis as Therapy**:
    
    - Observing and understanding a range of characters can be therapeutic, as it helps us reflect on and understand various human behaviors and motivations.
- **Depth of Understanding**:
    
    - When we engage with a story, we get a comprehensive view of the entire world the characters inhabit, and then we focus on the inner workings of the characters.
    - This dual perspective—both broad and deep—often gives us clearer insights into fictional characters and their worlds than into our own selves and our real world. The author cites the example of understanding Walter White from "Breaking Bad" more than understanding oneself or the intricacies of real-world societies.

In essence, the fixed and detailed portrayal of characters in stories allows for a profound analysis, giving us insights that are often clearer than our understanding of ourselves or the real world around us.

## CHARACTER LIMITS
Human nature is rife with opposing traits and behaviors. However, most people do not confront or deeply explore these inner contradictions in their daily lives. Here's a breakdown:

- **Human Dualities**:
    
    - Humans possess inherent contradictions, such as being capable of both good and evil or love and cruelty.
- **Literary Exploration**:
    
    - While many people don't delve deep into their internal contradictions, literature often magnifies these aspects. Characters like Sethe in "Beloved" by Toni Morrison or Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman in "Better Call Saul" embody extreme exploration of these inner paradoxes, often to an extent greater than most people would ever experience in real life.
- **Historical and Notable Figures**:
    
    - Well-known figures, such as William Randolph Hearst or historical leaders like Marcus Aurelius, Abraham Lincoln, and Eleanor Roosevelt, are often remembered more for their portrayals in literature, film, and other media than for their actual historical deeds. Their "characters" in these mediums amplify certain traits, bringing to the fore their internal conflicts or highlighting particular aspects of their personalities.
    - The portrayal of these figures in arts and media gives them a form of immortality, allowing them to be perceived and remembered in ways that may differ from their real-life personalities or actions.

In essence, while humans inherently possess various conflicting traits, it's through literature and media that these contradictions are deeply explored, often creating more vivid, lasting impressions of characters or historical figures than their real-world counterparts.

## CHARACTER FOCUS
While people often present themselves with a facade or "mask", fictional characters are crafted to spark curiosity and engage the audience. Here's a breakdown:

- **Human Interactions**:
    
    - People frequently put up defenses or superficial fronts in their interactions. Some individuals might be challenging to understand or might not seem worth the effort to decipher.
- **Crafting Fictional Characters**:
    
    - Authors have the power to transform even mundane or annoying personas into intricate characters that pique readers' interest. This transformation requires significant skill and psychological depth on the writer's part.
- **Intriguing Characters**:
    
    - Characters that challenge readers, making them think and analyze, often feel more authentic. The more layered, unpredictable, and complex a character is, the more lifelike and captivating they appear.
- **Contrast with Simplistic Characters**:
    
    - Characters that are overly consistent, predictable, and lack depth can come off as unrealistic or cartoonish. These characters often fail to engage readers deeply.

In essence, while people may hide behind facades, well-crafted fictional characters engage readers with their complexity. This depth and unpredictability often make them feel more authentic and relatable, even though they are products of an author's imagination.

## CHARACTER AND TIME
Stories and characters provide different perspectives on the passage of time and the nature of existence. Here's a breakdown:

- **Character's Perception of Time**:
    
    - For a character, time seems like a continuous stream, flowing from a vaguely recalled past into an uncertain future.
- **Readers/Audience's Perception**:
    
    - For readers or audiences, an author's narrative allows them to see time in a more structured way. Since the story's timeline is fixed, readers can revisit past events and anticipate future ones, giving them a broader perspective than the characters themselves.
- **Story vs. Character**:
    
    - A story represents life and existence as a sequence of events, while a character embodies the journey and evolution of humanity. While a story, once told, remains static, a character undergoes growth and transformation through conflict until they reach their destiny at the climax.
- **Ephemeral Nature of Ideas**:
    
    - Ideas and stories can be time-sensitive, losing relevance as societal values and contexts change. Even renowned tales may become outdated, but the essence of their characters can transcend time.
- **Enduring Characters**:
    
    - Iconic characters from literature, such as Homer's Odysseus, Shakespeare's Cleopatra, and others mentioned, have an enduring presence in collective consciousness. Even if the specifics of their stories fade, the characters themselves remain memorable and are often reinterpreted in various contexts.

In essence, while stories can become outdated due to changing societal norms and perspectives, the characters within them, especially those deeply developed and iconic, tend to have a timeless quality, ensuring their lasting impact on readers and audiences.

## CHARACTER AND BEAUTY 
True beauty in a character arises from the harmonious alignment of their traits and depths, irrespective of their physical appearance. Here's a breakdown:

- **Beauty vs. Prettiness**:
    
    - Beauty is an expression of depth and harmony, while prettiness is merely a superficial decoration.
- **Definitions of Beauty**:
    
    - Throughout history, beauty has been defined in various ways: Plato saw it as harmony, Aquinas as radiance, Elijah Jordan as sublimity, John Ruskin as clarity and repose, and Hegel described it as a calm without deeds. These definitions try to capture the essence of beauty that can be felt even in art that may be dark or chaotic.
- **Character and Beauty**:
    
    - A character can be evil or traditionally unattractive, but if their traits come together in a meaningful and harmonious way, they exude a type of beauty. This beauty might even appear grotesque but is still deeply resonant.
- **Response to Beauty**:
    
    - Beauty evokes emotions similar to love, making our connection to well-crafted characters more profound than just appreciation. It's not just about recognizing their depth; it's about feeling a genuine affection towards them.
- **Beauty vs. Kitsch**:
    
    - While beauty enhances and deepens our inner experiences, "kitsch" (art or other objects considered to lack serious artistic value) dulls or oversimplifies them.

In essence, a beautifully crafted character resonates deeply with audiences, generating feelings of love and appreciation, regardless of their outer appearance or moral standing.

## CHARACTER AND EMPAHTY
Empathy for characters in fiction requires a heightened level of sensitivity and allows us to explore our inner thoughts and emotions. By identifying vicariously with characters, we can better understand our own complex nature and connect with our shared humanity. Characters are created to be more interesting and insightful than real people and, with the help of prose, actors, and our own imaginations, they become more vivid in our minds.

Here's a breakdown:

- **Empathy and Sensitivity**:
    - Identifying with a character requires refined sensitivity. This identification enriches our mental and emotional experiences and helps us to reflect on our own inner selves.
- **Characters' Purpose**:
    - Characters exist to reveal the depth of human nature, including our strangeness, inconsistency, duplicity, and hidden beauty. Henry James stated that fiction should compete with life, implying that characters should be more compelling than real people, showcasing greater complexity and revealing more about humanity than real-life counterparts.
- **Desired Outcomes**:
    - A well-told story takes us into a world we would never experience, while a well-told character allows us to live a life we would never lead through someone unforgettable.
- **Shared Humanity and Empathy**:
    - Memorable characters connect us to shared humanity through empathy, allowing us to experience others' emotional lives vicariously.
- **Character Support**:
    - Characters are created with help from vivid prose, actors, and audience imagination. As audience members, we further enrich characters with our personal perspectives, giving them unique shadings.
- **Vivid Characters and Symbolism**:
    - Characters are more vivid than real-life people, as they are often designed to symbolize the human spirit, even when portrayed naturalistically.

In essence, well-written characters evoke empathy, enrich our emotional experiences, and offer insights into the human condition by symbolizing the human spirit. They compete with reality by providing us with more complex, revealing, and magnetic portrayals of humanity than we typically encounter in real life.

## CHARACTER AND THE AUTHOR
Characters in stories, while appearing lifelike, are crafted and choreographed entities serving the author’s purpose. Authors create these characters to add depth and meaning to narratives, as reality often lacks the structured beginnings, middles, or ends that stories provide. Characters offer a direct, unmasked insight into emotions and the human psyche, unlike real people who often hide behind societal masks.

So, why do writers dedicate their lives to character creation? Here are ten key reasons:

1. **Taste**: Writers need to have a discerning eye for what's good and bad, not just in others' works but in their own. A commitment to truthful writing requires writers to recognize and eradicate weaknesses in their craft.
    
2. **Knowledge**: Deep knowledge about the story's setting, history, and characters is paramount. This understanding emerges from personal experiences, academic research, and exploration of the world.
    
3. **Originality**: Real originality involves presenting a fresh perspective or revealing an uncharted truth. It’s less about doing something never done before and more about adding unique insights.
    
4. **Showmanship**: Writers are entertainers. They have to keep audiences hooked with a blend of truth and innovation.
    
5. **Awareness of the Reader/Audience**: Writers should always be conscious of their audience's reactions. Fiction needs to engage and satisfy the reader continuously.
    
6. **Mastery of Form**: Writers need to understand and appreciate the art form of storytelling itself. The interplay of character and story structure is fundamental.
    
7. **Hatred of Clichés**: Writers must avoid overused ideas or techniques. Being aware of clichés and ensuring originality in their work is essential.
    
8. **Moral Imagination**: This pertains to the writer's perspective on the world’s binaries (e.g., good/evil, rich/poor). Their personal values guide the portrayal of their characters.
    
9. **An Ideal Self**: When writing, an author channels their best self – the most intelligent, sensitive, and honest version of themselves.
    
10. **Self-Knowledge**: Deep understanding of oneself forms the foundation of character creation. This self-awareness helps writers create relatable characters that resonate with readers.
    

In essence, the act of creating characters allows writers to explore, reflect upon, and communicate profound insights about human nature.

## A LAST NOTE

Characters in stories offer different reflections of humanity. While poorly written characters give inaccurate depictions of people, clichéd characters show popular stereotypes or common perceptions. Unique characters reflect individual preferences, but it's the empathetic characters that truly mirror our inner selves. This is because stories allow us to experience emotions and situations, such as revenge, that we can't or don't wish to in real life. Through stories, characters enable us to explore various worlds and situations fueled by our capacity for empathy. Even though we might meet countless people in our lives, characters in stories can often provide deeper insights into human nature than real-life interactions. This is because we never truly know people, even those we're close to, as deeply as we understand a well-written character. Thus, many might find themselves connecting more with fictional characters than real individuals. If one doesn't believe that fictional narratives can have more depth than real-life experiences, they might need to rethink their engagement with storytelling as a profession or hobby.


# 2 THE ARISTOTLE DEBATE - Plot Versus Character
The distinctions of "plot-driven" and "character-driven" originated from mid-20th-century film critics differentiating between the entertainment-focused Hollywood movies and the more artistically sophisticated European cinema. Later, similar distinctions appeared in literary critiques, contrasting literary novels with best sellers. The theatre scene also mirrored this trend. Initially, Off-Broadway was a precursor for Broadway, but by the 1960s, a clear divide arose between art-focused and commercially-driven productions, especially along New York's Forty-Second Street. A similar separation occurred in the UK between traditional theaters in London's West End and the more experimental Fringe theaters. Fast forward, this dichotomy appeared in U.S. television, where subscription-based platforms emphasized character-driven narratives targeting mature audiences, contrasting with advertisement-funded networks that produced plot-centric shows for broader family audiences.

## ARISTOTLE'S RANKINGS
The debate between plot-driven and character-driven storytelling has a long history, starting with Aristotle's ranking of the elements of drama in his work "Poetics". Aristotle listed Plot as the most important and difficult component of dramatic art, followed by Character. This ranking held influence for two millennia until the novel became the dominant storytelling medium. By the end of the 19th century, writers and theorists began to argue that memorable characters are what readers truly want, relegating plot to a mere backdrop for character development.

This perspective conceives plot as actions and reactions on the physical and social planes, while character is limited to thoughts and feelings in the conscious and subconscious spheres. However, the relationship between plot and character is more intricate. Characters internalize external events as they perceive them, and their decisions lead to actions that become external events. The flow of events between the internal and external is continuous, and restricting plot to external actions misses the majority of a human being's experiences.

The argument of whether plot or character is more important or challenging is a flawed one, as the two concepts are intertwined. Plot and character are two sides of the same storytelling coin. A role becomes a character when actions and reactions are brought to life through events, while an incident becomes a storied event when a character causes or experiences change. A person untouched by events is static and uninteresting, while an activity without a character is trivial and uninvolving.

In essence, the debate over the significance of plot versus character is a specious one, as both are inextricably linked in storytelling, and understanding this distinction requires a deeper examination of their definitions.

## CHARACTER, PLOT, EVENT
The term "Character" refers to a fictional being who influences or reacts to events, whereas "Plot" describes the structure or sequence of events in a story. Essentially, every story must have a plot, meaning there's always a sequence of events. While stories can be told in various ways (flashbacks, shifting perspectives, etc.), it is the characters that anchor readers and viewers to the narrative.

Central to both character and plot is the concept of an "event." But in storytelling, not every happening is significant. For an event in a story to matter, it needs to bring about change in value. Values are essential aspects of human experience, existing in binaries like Life/Death, Love/Hate, or Poverty/Wealth. When something occurs that shifts these values from positive to negative or vice versa, it becomes a meaningful event in the story.

For instance, an event causing a character's feelings to shift from love to hate is significant because it alters the value from positive to negative. Similarly, a situation that changes a character's financial status from poor to wealthy is also meaningful due to the positive shift in value.

In conclusion, a "storied event" is a pivotal moment in a character's life marked by a significant change in value. This change can either result from a character's actions or their reactions to external events. The essence of storytelling is the portrayal of these value-charged events and how they impact the characters involved.

## TWO SIDES / SAME COIN

The relationship between characters and events in a story is deeply intertwined. An event's significance often lies in how it reveals a character's true nature or decision-making process. For example, in the movie "Chinatown", a revelation involving a character, Evelyn Mulwray, unveils a twist in the plot, exposing her father as the true villain. Additionally, the protagonist, J. J. Gittes, makes a pivotal decision, which both impacts the narrative and showcases his character flaw - his stubborn pride.

Essentially, viewing a story from the outside emphasizes events, but viewing it from the inside highlights the characters. Events determine a character's actions and reactions, while characters drive and influence events. This dynamic is encapsulated in Henry James's perspective that character is action and action forms the plot.

When issues arise in storytelling, particularly if a climax feels unsatisfying, the solution usually lies in tweaking either the character's traits or the sequence of events. By altering a character's core nature or decisions, the events in the story shift accordingly, and vice versa. The key is to ensure that changes in character psychology lead to believable events, and that plot changes are consistent with character development.

Aristotle, in his analysis of dramatic art, may have placed more emphasis on events due to the profound impact of plays like "Oedipus Rex", where fate-driven events are pivotal. Additionally, Athenian plays often lacked subtext and characters were straightforward, leading Aristotle to prioritize events over character depth. In modern storytelling, however, with a deeper understanding of psychology, there's an emphasis on the interplay between character and plot, making them equally vital.

## CHARACTERIZATION VERSUS TRUE CHARACTER
In storytelling, there are two primary facets to characters:

1. **Characterization:** The external, observable traits of a character. This includes things like age, appearance, speech patterns, job, and attitudes. It's essentially the mask or persona that a character presents to the world. While these aspects give readers an initial understanding of who the character is, they don't always reveal the deeper truth about the character's nature.
    
2. **True Character:** This pertains to a character’s innermost desires, values, and motivations. It's what drives their decisions, especially during critical moments. Their true character shines through the choices they make, especially under pressure.
    

For a story to be effective, the outer characterization must make the character seem credible, while their inner, true character drives the actions of the plot. If either is unbelievable or inconsistent, the narrative may falter.

The long-standing debate between "character-driven" and "plot-driven" stories is more about cultural politics than actual storytelling techniques. The term "character-driven" is often used to denote high art, something crafted with care and meant for an intellectual audience, while "plot-driven" can imply a story meant for mass appeal and profit. However, this distinction is not always accurate or useful. There are countless classics in literature and cinema that are primarily plot-driven yet are considered masterpieces.

The real difference between the two approaches lies in what primarily drives the events in the story:

- **Plot-driven stories:** Major events, especially the inciting incidents, are beyond the characters' control. These events can arise from natural disasters, societal issues, or sheer chance.
    
- **Character-driven stories:** The plot progresses primarily due to the choices and actions of the characters. Instead of external forces driving the narrative, it's the characters' decisions, stemming from their personal motivations and desires, that push the story forward.
    

In essence, whether a story is plot-driven or character-driven is about the primary source of causality in the narrative. Neither approach guarantees quality; it's the execution that matters.

The six key differences between plot-driven and character-driven stories are:

1. **Causality**:
    
    - **Plot-driven**: Major events, especially key turning points, are often influenced by external forces or events that are out of the characters' control (e.g., war, natural disasters, crimes).
    - **Character-driven**: The main events and turning points stem from the characters' personal desires, choices, and actions, showcasing their inner motivations.
2. **Identity**:
    
    - **Plot-driven**: Protagonists react to external desires or needs introduced to them.
    - **Character-driven**: Protagonists act based on desires originating within themselves.
3. **Values**:
    
    - **Plot-driven**: Protagonists are primarily concerned with external societal values like Justice/Injustice or Peace/War.
    - **Character-driven**: Protagonists grapple with personal values like Love/Hate or Truth/Lie.
4. **Depth**:
    
    - **Plot-driven**: Rarely delves into characters' subconscious or irrational motivations. The story is enhanced with details from external settings and social contexts.
    - **Character-driven**: Plunges deep into characters' psychologies, with their hidden desires often conflicting with their outward actions, revealing more intricate layers of their personality.
5. **Curiosity**:
    
    - **Plot-driven**: Focuses on external conflicts and polarizing roles (heroes vs. villains). The "how" of actions becomes the main curiosity driver, often involving unique tools, weapons, or powers.
    - **Character-driven**: The primary intrigue lies in internal conflicts, making the characters' unpredictable decisions central to the story.
6. **Freedom vs. Fate**:
    
    - **Plot-driven**: Characters often follow a predestined path based on their inherent nature, making outcomes seem inevitable.
    - **Character-driven**: Characters' decisions, rooted in their internal conflicts, shape the story, offering a sense of free will. This makes the ending feel less predestined and more a result of character choices.

In essence, plot-driven stories are majorly influenced by external events and clearly defined roles, while character-driven stories revolve around intricate personal motivations and unpredictable choices.

## MELDING PLOT AND CHARACTER
The extremes of plot-driven and character-driven stories differ in how they approach fate and freedom. While plot-driven narratives lean more towards predetermined outcomes and character-driven stories emphasize free will and choices, real life is a mix of both these elements. Talented storytellers often blend both types of causality, rather than relying solely on one.

## A LAST NOTE
To determine whether your story is more plot-driven, character-driven, or a combination of both, categorize each scene based on whether its pivotal moments are a result of character decisions or external forces. Regardless of the outcome, neither causality type is inherently better. Ultimately, the balance of these elements will naturally emerge as you further develop your narrative.
# 3 AN AUTHOR PREPARES
Before diving into the process of crafting characters, it's crucial to understand the core beliefs that guide a writer's creative endeavors. Consider your perspectives on fundamental topics such as human nature, cultural impact, and the duties of a writer.

## AN AUTHOR'S VISION OF CREATIVITY
The author presents three visions of creativity:

1. **Creativity as Madness:** Historically, creativity was often depicted as a state bordering on insanity. This view is reinforced in modern comedies that portray artists as neurotic individuals torn between indulging their fantasies and dealing with their repercussions.
    
2. **Creativity as Fantasy:** Freud suggested that creativity arises from the human need to escape from reality. While everyone daydreams to escape life's hardships, artists take these fantasies and manifest them into tangible forms, such as movies or novels. In this process, the distress of fictional characters becomes a source of pleasure for the audience, as there is no real threat.
    
3. **Creativity as Discovery:** From a neuroscience perspective, the brain's hemispheres each have their distinct functions. The left hemisphere handles logical processes and language, while the right is responsible for intuition, emotions, and creative thinking. Creativity is viewed as the intersection of these two hemispheres. It is the ability to draw unseen connections between existing things to create something entirely new. This "third thing" discovery is like a bridge between reason (left brain) and imagination (right brain). Creativity can flow in both directions, either by grounding abstract concepts into reality or by elevating real-life scenarios into broader themes.
    

In essence, creativity is a dynamic interplay between the logical and imaginative parts of our brain, continuously oscillating between the real and the abstract to create meaningful and memorable content.

## TWO THEORIES OF CHARACTER CREATION
The debate centers on whether writers invent their characters or if these characters are born from the writer's subconscious.

1. **Invention:** Some authors consciously craft their characters. They might be inspired by real-life observations or events and then deliberately create characters that fit their story idea. For instance, **Suzanne Collins** was inspired by juxtaposing reality shows with war footage, leading to the conception of "The Hunger Games." Similarly, **Patrick McGrath** might take inspiration from a peculiar behavior or a unique accessory and wonder about the kind of person exhibiting such traits. This deliberate creation from observed or imagined cues is seen as the author inventing their characters.
    
2. **Giving Birth:** On the other end of the spectrum, some authors perceive character creation as a more organic process. They believe their characters pre-exist and reveal themselves to the writer over time. **Elizabeth Bowen** believes characters gradually become apparent, akin to strangers conversing in low light. **Elizabeth Strout** feels her characters arise spontaneously and mysteriously. She captures these revelations on scraps of paper and waits for the characters to unveil their authentic selves. **Anne Lamott** humorously suggests that characters within her know their narratives but require her help to type them out.
    

Most writers likely employ a mix of both methods – consciously inventing some aspects while other facets emerge from their subconscious. The article critiques the notion of authors suggesting that their characters have free will, likening it to a painter claiming colors have minds or a composer blaming a chord for not sounding right. The author of the piece finds such claims as self-indulgent and somewhat deceitful.

In conclusion, characters are products of an author's mind, a blend of conscious invention and subconscious revelations. However, they remain firmly under the control of the writer, even if the process of creation can occasionally be surprising.

## CREATIVE HUNGER
An artist's creations come from a collection of knowledge and experiences stored in the subconscious mind. The right brain, adept at drawing connections, merges separate bits of information into unified ideas, then hands them to the left brain for execution. However, the limitation of every artist is that they can only draw from what's stored in their subconscious. This means that the depth of one's experiences and knowledge directly impacts the originality of their work. While an uninformed yet talented writer might occasionally produce beautiful snippets, composing intricate, full-length pieces requires extensive knowledge.

The real challenge for artists arises when their inspiration brings forth unfamiliar characters or scenarios. At this point, they recognize their knowledge is insufficient. Hence, a writer shouldn't merely masquerade as knowledgeable but should be genuinely well-informed, grounding their imaginative prowess with solid research.

For instance, if one dreams of a mysterious family in lab coats surrounded by test tubes, this evocative scene prompts numerous questions: Who are these characters? What is their objective? Is the imagery literal or symbolic? While trying to answer these questions, an artist realizes that without a wealth of unique information, they risk merely echoing other writers.

To combat this, artists should maintain files, cataloging everything they understand about their characters and the universe they inhabit. The act of writing solidifies knowledge, making it tangible and real. If they can't capture their understanding on paper, it's an indicator that they need to expand their knowledge base.

## THE FOUR RESEARCHES THAT FEED CREATIVITY
Artists leverage four primary types of research when developing their work:

1. **Personal Research**: This refers to drawing from one's memories and life experiences. Both real and fictional experiences are stored in our memory in a similar way. Thus, when crafting characters or scenes, an artist can delve into their past emotions, reactions, and experiences to create authentic moments. For example, by recalling personal instances of rebellion or pain, a writer can infuse realism into a fictional confrontation between family members.
    
2. **Imaginative Research**: This involves the power of imagination, which mixes various bits of one's past experiences, knowledge, dreams, and observations. Unlike memory, which replicates past events, imagination blends these fragments to create new scenarios. For instance, combining memories from different ages or juxtaposing real-life events with dream elements can offer unique character interactions or settings.
    
3. **Book-Bound Research**: Even with rich personal experiences and a vivid imagination, there will be gaps in one's knowledge. Reading and studying materials, especially academic or insightful works, can bridge these gaps. For instance, when writing about family dynamics, delving into scholarly articles on parent-child relationships can provide universal truths and unique insights, elevating the work and avoiding clichés.
    
4. **Grounded Research**: This is about grounding fictional elements in real-world settings. It involves seeking out and observing real-life counterparts to one's imagined scenarios. Like a documentary filmmaker, an artist should engage in firsthand observations, interviews, and note-taking to ensure the utmost authenticity. For instance, if one imagines a scene with equestrians, actually witnessing a dressage competition or speaking with participants can offer valuable details.
    

In essence, to craft authentic and compelling narratives, writers should merge their personal experiences with their imaginative capabilities, complement this with book-bound research, and validate their fictional scenarios with real-world observations.

## AN AUTHOR'S VISION OF NATURE
Original characters are birthed from a unique understanding and perspective of human nature. Each writer, in their distinct way, forms a personal theory about why people act and think the way they do. This individual theory is not based on a fixed recipe; instead, it evolves organically as artists, despite often being unstructured, piece together their observations and beliefs about humanity. This theory subsequently shapes their characters, guiding their motivations, decisions, and worldviews.

Central to this discussion is the age-old debate of nature versus nurture. The crux of this debate is determining what influences human behavior more:

- **Nature**: The intrinsic qualities one is born with, including genetics and inherent traits.
- **Nurture**: The external factors such as upbringing, culture, economic conditions, and societal influences.

In essence, writers need to decide how they view humanity: whether there's a universal human nature shared by all, or if humans are moldable, shaped by various external forces. These views impact how they depict characters, their stories, and their motivations. The ultimate question being, are our successes and failures a product of our inborn nature, or are they a result of our upbringing and environment?

## TWO GRAND THEORIES
Throughout history, humankind has sought to understand human behavior by developing philosophical and theoretical beliefs. These beliefs primarily bifurcate into two categories: the inside-out, intrinsic view focusing on individual nature (referred to as "Nature") and the outside-in, extrinsic perspective focusing on societal influences (referred to as "Nurture").

- **India:**
    
    - **Intrinsic**: Buddhism posits that the "self" or identity is an illusion, implying that the reality of individual identity is non-existent.
    - **Extrinsic**: Hinduism counters this, suggesting that while reality is a projection (or an illusion), the self is real and enduring.
- **Greece:**
    
    - **Intrinsic**: Socrates stressed the importance of self-awareness, asserting that understanding oneself is crucial for wisdom.
    - **Extrinsic**: Aristotle contended that real fulfillment comes from societal engagement and the public good.
- **China:**
    
    - **Intrinsic**: Taoism emphasizes alignment with the natural world and introspection.
    - **Extrinsic**: Confucianism emphasizes societal structures, moral responsibilities, and hierarchies in society.
- **Nineteenth Century:**
    
    - **Extrinsic**: Karl Marx believed that human nature is shaped continuously by societal forces.
    - **Intrinsic**: Sigmund Freud highlighted the subconscious mind, seeing it as the primary driver of behavior, rather than broader social constructs.
- **Twentieth Century:**
    
    - **Extrinsic**: Joseph Campbell theorized an overarching story (monomyth) embedded within cultures, which often led to stereotypical character development.
    - **Intrinsic**: William James discussed the duality and fluidity of the self, pondering how we can have a stable identity yet change over time.
- **Twenty-First Century:**
    
    - **Extrinsic**: Critical Theory or postmodernism sees the mind as a product of social conditioning, critiquing traditional methods of understanding as biased.
    - **Intrinsic**: Cognitive Science views the mind as a result of evolutionary design and believes that the mysteries of human behavior can eventually be decoded through scientific research.

Despite these dichotomies, the author underscores an often-overlooked factor: randomness or coincidence. Using the example of identical twins, who despite sharing genetics and sometimes environments, still develop distinctive personalities, the author suggests that neither nature nor nurture alone can explain human behavior entirely. The unpredictable events and chance occurrences play a significant role in shaping human lives. After chance events, only then do nature and nurture have their say in a person's reactions. In essence, human behavior is a complex interplay of inherent nature, societal influence, and the unpredictability of life.

## THREE KEYS TO AUTHORSHIP
To deepen your understanding of humanity beyond ordinary experiences and standard education, focus on three main faculties: Moral Imagination, Logical Implication, and Self-Knowledge. Cultivating these areas will allow you to comprehend and depict why characters act as they do.

1. **Moral Imagination**:
    
    - **Meaning**: It's an ability to sense life's moral values and distinctions, such as good vs. evil or honesty vs. dishonesty.
    - **Importance for Writers**: To create well-rounded characters and settings, a writer must infuse them with conflicting values that drive action and create tension. This imagination helps in capturing the dynamic moral compass within characters and their environment.
2. **Logical Implication**:
    
    - **Meaning**: Possessing an analytical mind that can build a comprehensive picture from small hints. It’s about extrapolating details to construct larger, more complex ideas or scenarios.
    - **Importance for Writers**: Writers must draw from hints or pieces of information to imagine entire characters, settings, or stories. It's like visualizing a whole based on a fragment, or vice versa.
3. **Self-Knowledge**:
    
    - **Meaning**: Recognizing that all writing is influenced by the writer's own experiences and worldview. It doesn't mean characters are replicas of the writer but are filtered through the writer’s perspective.
    - **Importance for Writers**: Self-awareness is central to character development. Writers must ask, "If I were this character, what would I do?" By understanding oneself, writers can better empathize with and depict varied characters. Despite individual differences, human beings share common emotions and experiences, which writers tap into for character creation.

In essence, by nurturing these faculties, writers can produce characters that resonate with readers, reflecting the complexities and intricacies of human nature.




# **PART TWO: BUILDING A CHARACTER**
*Characters in literature are often a mix of various influences, reflecting different aspects of civilization, literature, and personal experiences. When creating characters, writers face the dilemma of whether to start from the external environment and then develop the characters or vice versa. Additionally, there's the question of whether to begin character development from external traits and move inwards or to start with their core essence and work outwards. The following discussions will delve into these contrasting methods of character creation.*

# 4 CHARACTER INSPIRATION: OUTSIDE IN
Inspiration for a story typically begins as a small spark or fragment that an artist senses. This tiny seed often leads to a series of ideas, though many might be clichéd or fruitless. Eventually, with persistence, the writer may find a path to a successful narrative. To understand where inspiration might stem from, imagine an author's world as five nested spheres, each representing a realm of inspiration:

1. **Actuality Sphere**:
    
    - **Meaning**: The outermost realm representing real-world elements like time, place, current events, people, and history.
    - **Significance**: It is where writers draw from real-life experiences and settings, grounding their work in reality.
2. **Media Sphere**:
    
    - **Meaning**: The world of established media, which includes books, theater, and films.
    - **Significance**: Writers can be influenced by other artistic works, and understanding this sphere helps in identifying those influences.
3. **Genre Sphere**:
    
    - **Meaning**: This sphere represents the different storytelling genres and their respective conventions (e.g., romance, horror, mystery).
    - **Significance**: Being aware of genre conventions allows writers to work within or challenge established norms.
4. **Story Elements Sphere**:
    
    - **Meaning**: The backstory, character histories, pivotal moments in the narrative, and overarching themes that shape a story.
    - **Significance**: Understanding a story's foundational elements ensures depth and coherence in the narrative.
5. **Creative Self Sphere**:
    
    - **Meaning**: The core or heart of all these spheres - the author's unique perspective, experiences, and voice.
    - **Significance**: This is where the true essence of the story originates. The more introspective and self-aware a writer is, the more authentic and resonant the story will be.

In essence, an author's inspiration is influenced by a multitude of layers, ranging from the tangible world around them to their personal introspections. It's a journey from the vast expanse of reality to the intimate core of the writer's being.

## REALITY AS INSPIRATION
Character creation for a writer often arises from the intense interaction between real-world stimuli and an expansive imagination. Almost any sensory input can set off a stream of creative ideas that can evolve into a detailed character. The most significant source of inspiration for authors is observing other people, much like how musicians are inspired by sounds.

When an author crafts a character, they're using the many facets of human nature as building blocks, piecing them together to portray a range of behaviors. The distinction between real people and fictional characters is stark: while real people are multifaceted and still-evolving, characters are complete expressions of the inspiration that birthed them. Paradoxically, while real people are tangible, characters often feel more vibrant and "real" in a reader's mind. Characters don't interact with us; we become engrossed in their world and actions.

Famous early 20th-century authors, like **Henry James** and **Luigi Pirandello**, believed that while characters in novels could be deeply understood, truly knowing real people was near impossible, given that one can only observe their outward behaviors. They suggested that any attempts to deduce hidden intentions were at best educated guesses, laden with potential biases.

When basing a character on a real person, especially in memoirs, there's a risk of the portrayal being shallow or superficial. It's essential for a writer not to merely replicate but to reimagine real people, digging deeper into their essence. Direct inspiration from a person doesn't guarantee a believable character. For a character to be convincing, the writer must genuinely believe in them, and this often stems from noticing a unique aspect or "telling detail" that represents their larger humanity.

In essence, if writers merely rely on surface-level knowledge, their characters may come off as generic and less compelling. However, those who draw upon a comprehensive understanding of the world around them can craft unique, immersive characters that resonate with readers.

## MEDIUM AS INSPIRATION
The medium an author chooses to tell their story has a significant influence on the traits and behaviors of the characters they create. For instance, characters in films often communicate more visually, with facial expressions and body language, since the camera captures these nuances well. In contrast, stage characters rely more on verbal communication, as playwrights craft expressive dialogue to engage theater audiences. Stage and screen characters usually act in the present tense, focusing on their future goals, while prose characters often recount events in the past tense, providing retrospective interpretation. First-person narrators in prose typically have sharp memory, keen observational skills, and a strong sense of subtext.

The choice of medium also affects a writer's self-perception. Writers often identify as playwrights, showrunners, screenwriters, or novelists, each with its own rich tradition. However, confining oneself to a single medium can limit creative potential. Writers are encouraged to explore various formats and adapt their works accordingly. For instance, a rejected screenplay can be transformed into a stage play or a novel. Putting characters out for public consumption helps writers learn from audience reactions and refine their skills. The key is to embrace an all-media identity and simply call oneself a "writer."

Moreover, writers should reflect on their motivations. Are they passionate about the art within themselves, or are they enamored with the idea of living an artist's life? Some beginners may romanticize the notion of becoming a successful Hollywood or Broadway writer, or even living in writer communities in places like Connecticut. However, they often become discouraged after facing a few rejections and give up. Therefore, it's essential that the medium chosen resonates with a genuine love for storytelling rather than just a desirable lifestyle.

## GENRE AS INSPIRATION
Many writers might believe they draw inspiration primarily from real-life experiences, but in reality, they often find inspiration in other works of fiction more than they realize. The initial spark for a story might not necessarily come from a real-life event or observation but from an impactful line in a novel, dialogue in a film, or a captivating scene in a play or series, especially within their favorite genre. Different media platforms offer a range of genres, each with its subgenres. These genres can be blended to create unique story frameworks. Thus, when looking for fresh and innovative topics, writers should reflect on their own media consumption habits. By identifying the shows they binge-watch, the books they read, and the films or plays they're drawn to, writers can discover the genres they are truly passionate about. This self-awareness can serve as a starting point for character and story inspiration.

## EVENTS AS INSPIRATION
Konstantin Stanislavsky, a renowned Russian stage director, introduced the "Magic If" technique for actors. This approach involves posing hypothetical situations to stimulate the imagination and generate authentic reactions. By asking "What would happen if XXX occurred?", actors are prompted to imagine and act out genuine responses to the situation. Similarly, writers utilize this technique to shape their narratives. By contemplating hypothetical events or circumstances, they can devise a story's initiating event and then explore the characters' reactions. This starting point can dictate whether the story is led by its plot or by its characters. Stephen King, a celebrated novelist, uses this method by initiating his stories with plot-driven scenarios but aims for the characters to evolve and make unexpected decisions, making the narrative eventually feel character-driven.

## THEME AS INSPIRATION
Writing is an unpredictable journey where authors venture into uncharted territories, discovering the true essence of their stories as they progress. The most compelling stories arise not when writers impose a preconceived meaning but when they allow the story's events and characters to reveal it organically. The essence of powerful stories revolves around the transformation of core values, like shifting from hate to love or freedom to confinement. These narratives delve deep into societal issues or a character's inner psyche, unveiling truths through spontaneous improvisation. Conversely, when writers prioritize their personal beliefs over genuine exploration, their work often becomes rigid and didactic. Such writers can end up merely illustrating their convictions, turning characters into mere spokespeople for their ideas. This approach, reminiscent of ancient morality plays, is evident in contemporary "Social Drama" genre where themes are pulled directly from societal issues. When an author starts with a fixed theme and crafts the story backward to fit that belief, the narrative often becomes contrived and less effective. For instance, a story built around the theme "Love cures addiction" may end up simplifying complex issues and characters. Stories are most impactful when their meaning is discovered through the authentic exploration of character and plot, rather than predetermined beliefs shaping the narrative.

## THE SELF-STORY AS INSPIRATION
To better understand a character, imagine sitting them down and conversing with them, delving into their self-stories. These self-stories, which individuals construct about themselves, shed light on their perception of their life and the world around them. As a writer, you must discern whether what the character says about themselves is true, false, or somewhere in between. Every personal statement a character makes serves a purpose beyond its literal meaning and may contain an element of self-deception or exaggeration. For instance, even when a character confesses a fault, they might simultaneously be seeking affirmation for their supposed honesty and self-awareness.

People project a certain persona to navigate daily life smoothly, which is often a mask hiding their true self. To gain insight into a character's genuine self, ask about pivotal moments in their life, the difficult choices they've made, and actions they've taken in high-risk situations. The coherence and consistency in their self-story can indicate a well-structured psychology, while inconsistencies can suggest a more complex, possibly conflicted, inner world.

Characters, like real people, often grapple with internal contradictions, desiring things that are inherently in conflict. For instance, someone may desire professional success but also expect warmth and camaraderie from colleagues, which may not always coexist. Delve deeper into the motivations behind their desires and actions. Constantly question their "whys" to uncover deeper layers of their psyche.

Beliefs play a pivotal role in shaping a character's actions and worldview. Understanding what they believe in, be it religious, moral, or personal, can be illuminating. However, beliefs are not always static; they can change, sometimes rapidly. This fluidity of beliefs, especially in staunch believers, shows that sometimes the intensity of belief is more significant than the content of the belief itself. The insights gained from exploring these various facets can help in crafting multidimensional and intricate characters.

# 5 CHARACTER INSPIRATION: INSIDE OUT

## THE OBSERVER AND THE OBSERVED
One of the most profound methods of writing is when the author immerses herself deeply into the consciousness of her character, a technique termed as "writing-in-character." Instead of just observing or imagining the character's actions and emotions from a distance, the writer takes on the character's perspective, experiencing the fictional world as if it were happening directly to them. Essentially, the writer acts as the character's first actor.

This approach, inspired by **Konstantin Stanislavsky**'s "Magic If," involves the writer not simply asking, "What would I do in this situation?" or "What would my character do in this situation?" but rather, "If I were this character in this situation, what would I do?" This subtle shift in perspective allows the writer to genuinely feel the character's emotions and respond authentically to the fictional circumstances.

For this method to be effective, the writer should do more than just consider what's happening in the character's mind. They must fully inhabit the character, merging their consciousness with the character's. This results in more genuine and intricate portrayals on the page, stage, or screen.

However, to genuinely tap into the emotions and intricacies of a fictional character, the writer must first have a deep understanding of their own inner life. Self-awareness and introspection are essential, as knowing oneself deeply enables the writer to delve into the depths of their characters. In essence, the writer's authentic understanding of their nature can be reflected in every character they create. Thus, before trying to master the writing-in-character technique, a writer should first explore and understand the multi-layered facets of their own humanity.

## FOUR SELVES IN SEARCH OF CHARACTER
In this passage, the author delves into different aspects of a character's identity and behavior:

**Private Selves: Variations of Identity**
- **William James** introduced the concept of the core self, the unchanging essence of one's identity.
- The core self maintains a stable sense of identity throughout life while evolving in consciousness.
- The core self observes and absorbs past selves, resulting in a paradox of change and constancy.
- Characters' inner voices are unique to themselves; consciousness operates like a cinematic experience.

**The Extended Self**
- The concept of the extended self by Henry and William James includes possessions, relationships, and experiences that shape one's identity.
- Losing something or someone tied to one's identity feels like a personal loss.
- A person's total sense of self is formed by all the things they consider their own.

**The Protected Self**
- The core self keeps its secrets, harboring willpower, rational thought, and moral sensibility.
- This protected self provides the voice for first-person narration in novels.

**The Vanished Self**
- Extreme stress or trauma can cause the core self to weaken, resulting in overwhelming emotions, personality changes, or even the disappearance of the core self.
- Characters experiencing a loss of self can lead to radical changes in perception and behavior, challenging writers to portray altered realities.

**Personal Selves: Variations of Intimacy**
- Different types of relationships lead to varying behaviors and adaptations of the "agent self."
- Personal relationships like family, friends, and lovers are defined by degrees of intimacy and shared experiences.
- People have different versions of themselves for different relationships, which are temporary behaviors.

**Social Selves: Variations of Power**
- Power dynamics shape social interactions, leading to the development of social personas or "selves."
- Characters use social masks to navigate various situations and protect their core self.
- Different social selves are necessary for encounters with varying levels of familiarity and status.

**Developing Characters' Personal and Social Selves**
- Writers' theories of psychological cause and effect influence how they develop characters' personal and social selves.
- The interplay between childhood and adulthood roles, core self, and evolving identity is explored.
- The tension between a character's inherited identity and their personal evolution is highlighted.

**The Hidden Self: Variations of Desire**
- The subconscious self exists behind the conscious mind and influences perceptions and feelings.
- The subconscious "thinks" rapidly, absorbing sensory stimuli and making decisions.
- Innate desires arise from the hidden self, affecting judgments and feelings.
- The question is raised whether authors can improvise from within a character's subconscious mind, given its lack of language and self-awareness.

The passage emphasizes that writers have the creative freedom to incorporate these different levels of identity and behavior in their characters to create depth and complexity.

## MAD MEN: THE FOUR SELVES IN ACTION
The show "Mad Men," created by Matthew Weiner, uses a four-level structure to develop its characters' complexity: Social Self, Personal Self, Core Self, and Hidden Self. Here's a breakdown of how this structure is applied to some of the show's main characters:

**Don Draper (Jon Hamm)**

- Social Self: Ad agency creative director skilled at charming clients.
- Personal Self: Presents a perfect family image but engages in extramarital affairs.
- Core Self: Concealed identity, guilt-ridden, incapable of love due to past actions.
- Hidden Self: Haunted by a sense of dread and fears life's meaninglessness.

**Betty Draper (January Jones)**

- Social Self: Former model, mother, horse rider, and smoker.
- Personal Self: Trapped in an unhappy marriage, pregnant with unwanted child.
- Core Self: Uses sexuality for revenge, struggles with self-doubt.
- Hidden Self: Feels reliant on her beauty for worth.

**Roger Sterling (John Slattery)**

- Social Self: Firm partner, has had heart attacks.
- Personal Self: Struggles with mistresses, considers divorce.
- Core Self: Suppresses feelings for Joan.
- Hidden Self: Fears being alone.

**Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss)**

- Social Self: Climbs career ladder from secretary to copywriter.
- Personal Self: Devout Catholic, resists family's marriage pressures.
- Core Self: Conceals pregnancy.
- Hidden Self: Intelligent, battles with unspoken sexual impulses.

**Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser)**

- Social Self: Ambitious, playing power games to advance.
- Personal Self: Struggles with wife's infertility.
- Core Self: Has a child with Peggy, yearns for the child he never knows.
- Hidden Self: Hides his lack of talent.

**Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks)**

- Social Self: Appears glamorous but insightful.
- Personal Self: Endures loveless marriage, divorce, and illegitimate child.
- Core Self: Believes marriage gives life meaning, despite business acumen.
- Hidden Self: Independent loner.

**Sal Romano (Bryan Batt)**

- Social Self: Art director, illustrates slogans.
- Personal Self: Married, closeted homosexuality.
- Core Self: Struggles to hide his true identity.
- Hidden Self: Hates being gay.

The four-level structure enriches the character development by exploring the different dimensions of their identities and motivations, contributing to the depth and complexity of the show's narrative.

## OUTSIDE IN / INSIDE OUT
Writing in-character is a technique where writers immerse themselves in their characters' personalities and lives. It creates a deep bond between the writer's creative process and the character's essence. However, not many writers solely rely on this internal perspective. Instead, they often employ a two-fold approach:

1. **External Perspective:** Writers first gather external cues about the character. This could be from their environment, societal norms, age, intelligence level, and genetic predispositions. These aspects provide a contextual understanding of the character's life.
    
2. **Internal Dive:** Once equipped with this external knowledge, writers delve into the character's innate behaviors, instincts, and emotions. The "Magic If" is a method used here, where the writer asks themselves, "What would I do if I were this character in this specific situation?" This helps the writer immerse into the character's shoes.
    

While in this in-character mode, writers don't stick to just one perspective. They might alternate viewpoints, especially when multiple characters are involved in a scene. They might ask, “How would Character A respond?” and then “How would Character B react to that response?” By stepping in and out of these characters, writers gain both a deep, internal understanding of each character, and a more objective, bird's-eye view of the interactions. This toggling between subjective (inside) and objective (outside) viewpoints is repeated until the scene is polished and refined.

E. L. Doctorow, a renowned writer, exemplifies this alternating technique. In his historical fiction works like "Ragtime" and "The Waterworks," Doctorow would extensively research his topics, becoming almost an expert. However, when bringing his characters to life, he blended fiction and reality. His fictional characters feel like they've been plucked from history, while his historically accurate figures seem freshly imagined from his creative mind.

# 6 ROLES VERSUS CHARACTER
A role in a story is a basic template or position, like "Mother" or "Boss." It's a label that describes a function or position in the story's societal structure. Think of it like a blank template or an empty picture frame, waiting to be filled.

A character, on the other hand, is a distinct, individual personality that fits into one of these roles. It's the unique person who brings a particular role to life by adding their specific traits, quirks, history, and emotions. In the analogy, the character is the painting that fills the empty canvas of the frame.

So, while a "Mother" role might involve tasks like feeding children, a character within that role could do it uniquely, maybe singing songs while cooking or telling stories during mealtime.

When constructing a story, it's important for writers to ensure that each character within the cast is distinct and doesn't merely replicate the tasks or characteristics of another. Each character should bring their own flavor and dynamic to the overall narrative, ensuring richness and variety in the story.

## CAST FORMATION 
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters in a story form a complex web of relationships, akin to a cosmic system. If we visualize this system:

- The **protagonist** (or main character) is like the central sun or star.
  
- **Supporting roles** can be imagined as celestial bodies orbiting this central star:
  - **Closest to the protagonist** are the most influential characters, playing a significant role in the narrative.
  - **Further out** are minor characters with less direct influence on the protagonist's journey.
  - At the **outermost orbits** are characters with minimal presence in the story, like extras or background characters that might appear just once or not have speaking roles.

- A **third-person narrator** observes this entire system from afar, like a deity overseeing the universe. They provide a more detached and encompassing perspective on the events.

To effectively build a story's ensemble of characters, start by defining the protagonist and then progressively flesh out the supporting characters, expanding outward from the most crucial to the least significant.

### Protagonist
**Summary and Clarification:**

A protagonist is the central character in a story, and there are specific attributes and roles associated with this character:

1. **Willpower:** When faced with an event that upsets the balance of their life, the protagonist's instincts kick in. They desire an objective that would restore balance. Throughout their journey, they'll face numerous obstacles, but a true protagonist's strength lies in their determination to overcome the biggest challenges.

2. **Multiple Capabilities:** Protagonists possess a mix of mental, emotional, and physical qualities. These unique traits should allow readers/audiences to believe in the choices and actions of the protagonist as genuine and believable.

3. **An Underdog Status:** When we compare the strength of the protagonist to all the antagonistic forces they will face, the protagonist often appears to be the underdog. They might have a slim chance of achieving their objective but that chance exists.

4. **Empathic Nature:** Most stories position the protagonist as the "Center of Good", making them the primary figure for the reader/audience's empathy. This center of positive values in a generally negative surrounding attracts readers' identification and attachment.

5. **Intrigue:** Due to their complexities and contradictions, protagonists are often the most interesting characters in a story, sparking the reader's curiosity.

6. **Length and Depth:** The protagonist is the character that is most explored throughout a story. As they make challenging decisions, we see their subconscious motivations and deepest desires.

7. **Capacity for Change:** While most people remain consistent in their core nature, protagonists often undergo significant change, be it positive or negative, symbolic or realistic.

8. **Insight & Epiphany:** Protagonists are prone to moments of profound realization, known as epiphanies. These are moments where the protagonist's view shifts dramatically, sometimes leading to significant action or internal transformation. While these moments can be powerfully resonant, they also run the risk of feeling overly dramatic if not executed with nuance.

In essence, the protagonist is a multi-faceted character, possessing determination, complexity, relatability, and the capacity for deep insight. Their journey is central to the story, and their experiences and transformations play a pivotal role in engaging the reader or audience.

### Protagonist Variations
**Summary & Clarification of Protagonist Variations:**

1. **Co-protagonists:** Two characters with contrasting qualities share the central role. Examples include characters from Rudyard Kipling’s “The Man Who Would Be King” and movies like “Thelma & Louise.” Some co-protagonists, like in Beckett’s "Waiting for Godot," are used to emphasize similarity rather than complexity.

2. **Group Protagonists:** A group shares the protagonist role if they share a unified desire and mutually experience triumphs and setbacks. Examples are films like "Seven Samurai" and Eisenstein's depiction of large populations in revolt.

3. **Multi-protagonists:** Multiple storylines revolve around a theme, each with its individual protagonist. Examples include movies like “Crash” and "Wild Tales."

4. **Split Protagonists:** A single character has a dual nature or split personality. Notable examples are "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and "Fight Club." 

5. **Passive Protagonists:** Characters who externally appear inactive or indifferent, but internally grapple with profound dilemmas. Examples include the lead in “Milkman,” who tries to avoid a stalker, and Schmidt from "About Schmidt" who is full of life regrets.

6. **Switching Protagonists:** The story begins with one apparent protagonist, but shifts focus after a significant event. In "The Killing Fields," the protagonist changes from an American journalist to his cameraman. In “Psycho,” the protagonist's sudden death shifts the narrative.

7. **Metaphorical Protagonists:** Non-human entities that represent human qualities or aspirations can be protagonists if they make decisions driven by desire, such as cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny, animals like Babe, or even inanimate objects like Wall-E.

In essence, while traditionally a story might center on one protagonist, there are diverse and creative ways to present the central character or characters in a narrative. This variety adds richness and depth to storytelling across different mediums.

### First Circle Characters
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Characters in Stories: A Comprehensive Guide**

1. **First Circle Characters:**
    - Major characters impact the protagonist in various ways.
    - *Support Role:* Changes the course of events. 
    - *Service Role:* Does not change the course.
        - For instance, in a crime story, the cop finding a body is service, while the coroner finding a crucial clue is support.
    - Major characters are fleshed out and could have stories of their own.

2. **Uses of these Characters:**
    - *Subplot Protagonists:* A major character can be a protagonist of a subplot. They can either affect the main plot (support) or run alongside it without impact (service). 
        - Example: In "The Godfather", Michael's journey is central, Tessio's betrayal supports it, but the love story simply adds depth.
    - *Focal Character:* The one drawing most interest, usually the protagonist. But sometimes, another character can steal the show.
        - Example: Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice" or Hannibal Lecter in "The Silence of the Lambs".
    - *Foil Character:* Enhances the protagonist by contrasting or paralleling with them.
        - Foils can:
            1. Highlight the protagonist's traits by being their opposite.
            2. Provide clarity when the protagonist is blinded by their journey.
            3. Showcase a contrasting moral compass.
            4. Give insights into a mysterious protagonist.
            5. Interpret a protagonist's profound realization.
            6. Highlight a protagonist's complexities.
            7. Anchor a larger-than-life protagonist in reality.

3. **Point of View (POV) Character:**
    - Usually the protagonist, but there are exceptions where another character narrates the story.
        - Example: Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes or Nick Carraway in "The Great Gatsby".

4. **Major Support Roles:**
    - Help or hinder the protagonist.
    - Can be allies or antagonists, even villains.
    - Sometimes, the protagonist can be their own enemy.

5. **Major Service Roles:**
    - Characters that seem independent of the story's main events.
    - They provide depth but don't change the main narrative.
        - Example: Miss Flite in Dickens's "Bleak House".

6. **Potential Risks:** 
    - If a secondary character becomes too dominant, they might overshadow the protagonist and derail the story.
        - Example: Dicky Eklund in "The Fighter".

In essence, stories use a variety of characters that serve different functions, whether to support, provide depth, contrast, or illuminate the protagonist. Properly balancing these characters is key to effective storytelling.


### Second Circle Characters
- **Definition**: These are characters of lesser depth, limited to a single dimension or trait, and they have limited screen or page time. While they might be simpler, they should still have multiple facets to them to make them feel human.
- **Support Roles**: These characters influence the story's direction but don’t captivate the audience when they are not part of the main scenes. Examples include Claudius from "Hamlet" and Milo Minderbinder from "Catch-22".
- **Service Roles**: These characters provide a predictable behavior, grounding the story's setting through archetypal roles, types, or stock characters. Their behavior remains consistent throughout, adding authenticity to the story setting.

### Third Circle Characters
- **Definition**: These are minor characters who have the least connection to the protagonist. They typically appear once, and their roles are mostly service-oriented.
- **Characteristics**: Occasionally, they may have a brief moment of significance, but they're usually not fleshed out or given depth. They are often used as props to advance the plot or to provide background and context.
- **Background Masses**: Representing the broader setting of a story, these characters (like crowds in a stadium) depict the general populace through which the main characters interact.

In essence, while main characters drive the plot and engage the audience with depth and development, second circle characters provide auxiliary support, and third circle characters offer background and setting details to enrich the story's world.

### Narrators
Narrators guide readers and audiences through a story's exposition. They can be classified based on person, medium, and reliability:

#### Based on Person
- **First-person narrator**: A character narrates their own story. Examples include Tom Wingfield in "The Glass Menagerie" and novels like "The Great Gatsby".
  
- **Second-person narrator**: The story is told as if the reader/audience is experiencing events firsthand using the pronoun "you". This method turns the reader into a protagonist, like in Jay McInerney’s "Bright Lights, Big City".
  
- **Third-person narrator**: This is an external voice of knowledge. It doesn't participate in events, offering an omniscient viewpoint. Examples include the Stage Manager in "Our Town" and novels like Jonathan Franzen’s "The Corrections".

#### Medium-Specific Narrators
- **Onstage**: Narrators can be direct like Tom Wingfield or indirect like the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder’s "Our Town".
  
- **On the Page**: Novels often use first-person for empathetic characters, third-person for an omniscient view, and rarely the second-person, like "Bright Lights, Big City".
  
- **On-screen**: Narrators can vary in reliability, from truthful in "Memento" to deceitful in "The Usual Suspects".

##### Unreliable Narrators
Sometimes, narrators can be unreliable, either by deception, faulty memory, or biased viewpoint.

**Reasons for Unreliability**:
- **Enhanced Credibility**: Imperfections make characters relatable and credible. Perfect characters feel unreal, while those who misinterpret or self-deceive feel more human. Flaws make them trustworthy to audiences.
  
- **Greater Curiosity**: Unreliability can increase tension and intrigue. For example, different characters remembering events differently in "Rashomon" or lies being uncovered like in "The Wasp Factory".

**Medium-specific Unreliable Narrators**:
- **On the Page**: Authors can portray unstable minds like in “The Tell-Tale Heart”, innocence like Holden Caulfield in "The Catcher in the Rye", or deceit like in "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd".
  
- **On-screen**: Films can show unreliable first-person perspectives due to varying reasons like faulty memories in "How I Met Your Mother" or deceit in "The Usual Suspects".
  
- **Onstage**: The theater, as a more objective medium, requires imaginative portrayals to show unreliability. An example is "The Father", where the stage becomes the mind of a man with dementia.

In essence, narrators guide the audience through a story, but their reliability can vary based on the narrative intent, medium, and the complexity of characters. Unreliability can be a tool to enhance credibility and spark curiosity.



# 7 THE OUTER CHARACTER
**Summary & Clarification**:

Humans are inherently social and, for evolutionary purposes, have learned to manage the impressions they give off in various situations. This adaptability has led to humans playing different roles in diverse contexts to fulfill fundamental social goals: fitting in, advancing their position, and attracting partners. This natural inclination towards adaptability has rendered humans as innate actors, adjusting their behavior based on their current situation and relationship.

This doesn't mean humans are disingenuous. Instead, it highlights our capacity to transition between various selves based on the dynamics of a given situation. For instance, one's demeanor might differ when interacting with a religious leader versus a spouse or a stranger.

For storytellers, understanding this complex mosaic of human behaviors is crucial. When developing characters, it's essential to recognize and depict these varying roles and external behaviors, which collectively form a character's "Characterization". This helps in creating authentic, relatable characters that resonate with readers and audiences.

## CHARACTERIZATION 
**Summary & Clarification**:

When crafting characters in your creative work, it's helpful to differentiate between two main components: "characterization" and "true character."

- **True Character**: Refers to a character's deep-seated internal attributes, including their core beliefs, motivations, and hidden aspects that might not be immediately evident. These inner qualities will be further discussed in subsequent content.
  
- **Characterization**: Encompasses the outward, observable traits and behaviors of a character. These are the aspects of a character that the world sees and interacts with. This includes explicit details like their name, age, occupation, and physical appearance, as well as more subtle cues like body language, tone of voice, and their interactions with others.

For a comprehensive understanding of a character, it's a useful exercise to mentally "follow" them around day and night. This immersive method helps in capturing both their overt traits (like their job or home) and the more implicit ones (such as their beliefs or emotions). By doing so, you'll get a holistic view of who they are, both inside and out.

## THE THREE FUNCTIONS OF CHARACTERIZATION
**Summary & Clarification**:

Characterization in a story serves three main purposes: to provide credibility, originality, and intrigue.

1. **Credibility**: The fear for most writers is that their audience won't believe in the characters or their actions. When a character's behavior doesn't match their portrayed traits, audiences disconnect and may abandon the story. For instance, if the actions of a character don't align with how they've been presented, it leads to disbelief. However, even in fantastical tales, as long as characters are well-defined and consistent (like Harry Potter or Luke Skywalker), audiences can still feel connected.

2. **Originality**: Audiences seek stories that offer fresh perspectives and unique characters. The key to originality lies in specificity. Broad, generalized character traits result in predictable and clichéd roles. On the other hand, a detailed, well-researched characterization leads to characters that stand out and feel fresh. For instance, a broadly described "fashion-conscious" character is less impactful than one whose fashion choices are rooted in meticulous research and observation, resulting in a truly unique and believable individual.

3. **Intrigue**: Unique characterizations make audiences curious about what lies beneath the surface. However, clichéd character portrayals, like the stereotypical portrayal of an angry, out-of-work husband, lack depth and fail to spark curiosity. A character should never feel one-dimensional; they should have layers that the audience wants to uncover. To truly engage the audience, the setting and characters both need to be captivating and multifaceted.

In essence, for a story to be successful, characters must feel believable, distinct, and spark the audience's interest, prompting them to delve deeper into the narrative.

## SETTING: WORLD BUILDING
**Summary & Clarification**:

1. **Characterization Influences**: A character's traits, such as gender and hair color, are determined by genetics. However, external factors, including physical and social settings as well as time and space, significantly shape a character's outer persona. This ranges from daily activities to larger life events, and their behaviors often develop from birth.

2. **Moral Imagination**: Writers should see significance in every part of their story, ensuring that each element, whether a prop or a scene, carries a specific value or sentiment. This helps in making the narrative rich and multi-dimensional. A morally imaginative writer sees deeper meanings, even in mundane objects, ensuring the setting isn't just background but is filled with meaningful details.

3. **Cultural Restraints**: Characters are bound by the cultural norms and expectations of their environment. These norms define what a character can or cannot do, and often, positive relationships result in more civilized behaviors, while the lack of them can lead to unpredictability.

4. **Physical Settings**: The external environment, both in terms of time and place, has dual effects. While it can provide benefits like shelter and sustenance, it can also pose challenges, such as pollution. These settings, like weather patterns, impact characters' personalities and actions in different ways, either supporting or challenging their desires.

5. **Social Settings**: Characters are influenced by societal structures, which offer a sense of belonging or opposition. Groups, be it based on nationality, religion, or profession, play a role in molding a character's identity. Large institutions often demand a significant personal price for being a part of them, sometimes dehumanizing individuals or leading them to self-deception. Yet, within such systems, there's a vast variety of personalities.

6. **Personal Settings**: Personal relationships, such as with family or lovers, provide unique conflicts in a story. These connections, filled with deep emotions, can be both sources of joy and tension. They present opportunities for rich character development, with intricate layers of love, betrayal, respect, and disagreement.

In essence, while genes play a role in character development, external factors ranging from physical environments to personal relationships have profound influences, offering storytellers numerous layers to explore and enrich their narratives.

### SETTING VERSUS CHARACTERIZATION
**Summary & Clarification**:

Characters' interactions with their environment, including physical, social, and personal aspects, play a crucial role in defining their traits and behaviors. Here's how the setting can influence and shape a character:

1. **Character Extension**: A character's belongings, like homes and clothes, can become a reflection of their core identity. In literature, this concept suggests that objects a character owns or surrounds themselves with can represent aspects of their personality or life. For instance, the things one chooses to wear or the books one reads can be expressive of their inner self.

2. **Forces of Antagonism**: The environment can present challenges that obstruct a character's goals, leading to unexpected reactions. These challenges can come from nature or society, causing a rift between the character's expectations and reality, often leading to unpredictable behaviors.

3. **Metaphorical Representation**: The setting, combined with its characters, can symbolize a broader reality or societal commentary. For instance, a peculiar setting combined with its odd characters can serve as a metaphor for human nature or societal norms.

4. **Influence on Thoughts**: A character's surroundings can dominate their thoughts, triggering a rush of memories, emotions, or ideas. The setting acts as a catalyst for internal reflections.

5. **Background vs. Foreground**: Sometimes, the environment takes a backseat, letting characters take the center stage. The setting acts more like a backdrop, providing context but not actively influencing the narrative.

6. **Indifference of Setting**: In certain narratives, the environment feels detached, almost oblivious to the characters, giving them a feeling of isolation or existential pondering.

7. **Animating Objects**: Some stories assign intentions or feelings to inanimate objects, making them almost lifelike or suggesting they possess a kind of consciousness.

8. **Objects as Characters**: Beyond just animating them, settings can transform objects into full-blown characters, giving them roles, personalities, and significance in the storyline.

In essence, the relationship between characters and their environment is multifaceted, with settings playing various roles - from being a silent backdrop to an active participant in the story's unfolding.

## CHARACTERIZATION CHANGE

Characters evolve when they engage with different physical, social, and personal environments. Their personalities can morph based on various external factors. Here are four common ways through which characters might change:

1. **Rebellion**: Characters can actively alter their surroundings in hopes of reshaping their personalities. For instance, a countryside artist might move to a bustling city to find themselves or redefine their identity. Similarly, a dedicated scholar could suddenly join the military, seeking a shift in perspective.

2. **Travel**: Exploring new places can lead to an amalgamation of cultural identities. For instance, the widespread adoption of jeans and tennis shoes, regardless of their origin, is a testament to the global influence of youth culture.

3. **Time Travel**: Characters can be influenced by different time perspectives. Some might be trapped in nostalgia, constantly reminiscing about the past. Others might be obsessively future-focused, while some live in a twisted version of the present, seeking pleasure without thought of consequence.

4. **The Internet**: The digital realm offers limitless opportunities for identity exploration. Its nature is fast, anonymous, and often lacks depth. Still, it's impactful because real interactions occur there, influencing people's identities either positively or negatively.

In essence, characters don't remain static. Their interactions with varied environments can lead to significant shifts in their personalities and identities.

## EXPLICIT TRAITS
**Summary & Clarification**:

**Characterization through Explicit Traits**:

1. **Origins of Traits**: Characters possess traits derived from both genetics (like vocal quality) and learned behaviors (like vocabulary). A combination of these factors results in unique character profiles.
  
2. **Trait Spectrum**: Traits can be observed on a scale from positive to negative, with some displayed in public settings (e.g., sophisticated vs. unsophisticated) and others in private, more intimate settings (e.g., generous vs. selfish).

3. **Optimal Trait Density**: Characters shouldn’t be fully detailed. Leaving some aspects of a character mysterious allows readers/audiences to use their imagination. If you depict every possible trait, the character becomes overwhelming, but too few makes them one-dimensional.

**Factors to Consider in Characterization**:

1. **Names and Nicknames**: Names in fiction can convey deeper meanings than in real life. They can be symbolic but should be chosen wisely to avoid clichés or overtness.

2. **Physical Appearance**: Consider every aspect of a character's physique, from their body type to their skin texture, and even the clothes they choose to wear.

3. **Gender & Sex Life**: Understand your character’s gender and their sexual preferences.

4. **Vocal Tone & Language**: Characters should have distinct speech patterns that reflect their personality and background.

5. **Facial Expressions & Gestures**: Expressions can be picked up quickly by audiences, so it's crucial to depict consistent and telling mannerisms.

6. **Profession & Recreation**: Characters can derive identity from their job and hobbies, which provide insights into their personality.

7. **Home & Transportation**: Assets, like homes and cars, can reflect a lot about a character's priorities and status.

8. **Knowledge & Ignorance**: A character's education and life experiences shape their worldview.

9. **Religion & Beliefs**: Core beliefs play a crucial role in decision-making during conflicts.

10. **Conversation**: Regular topics of a character's conversations reveal their concerns and priorities.

11. **Manners**: The way characters treat others and their general decorum can indicate deeper values and beliefs.

In essence, creating a character involves a meticulous amalgamation of various traits, both inherent and acquired. The judicious use of these elements can help in creating a well-rounded and believable character.

## IMPLICIT TRAITS
Characters start off as enigmas. Their observable, outer traits give hints about their deeper, hidden characteristics. As the story progresses, readers or audiences interpret these external traits to understand the character's inner attributes. Thus, it's crucial for storytellers to delve deep into their characters' inherent qualities, such as their inherent nature, intelligence level, mindset, feelings, and other internal factors.

### VARIETIES OF PERSONALITY 
**Summary & Clarification**:

**Personalities**:

- Personalities have been studied for millennia. As early as 319 BC, Theophrastus attempted to categorize character types but only listed thirty. Modern humorists like Mark Twain have added to the list, yet the full spectrum remains elusive.
  
- Psychologists have tried to categorize personalities into five major categories, each with a positive to negative spectrum:
  
  1. **Openness/Closedness**: 
     - **Openness**: A trait marked by curiosity, appreciation for art, and a penchant for novelty. Highly open individuals might enjoy thrilling experiences like skydiving, though they can seem erratic.
     - **Closedness**: Denotes pragmatism and focus. Such individuals can appear dogmatic.

  2. **Conscientiousness/Capriciousness**: 
     - **Conscientiousness**: Indicates a sense of duty, discipline, and a planned approach to life. Taken to an extreme, it can seem like stubbornness.
     - **Capriciousness**: Reflects spontaneity but can come off as unreliable.

  3. **Extraversion/Introversion**: 
     - **Extraversion**: Characterized by sociability and assertiveness. Such personalities might come off as attention-seeking.
     - **Introversion**: Suggests a more reflective personality, but can be perceived as distant.

  4. **Agreeableness/Argumentativeness**: 
     - **Agreeableness**: Implies compassion and generosity. However, excessive agreeableness can be seen as naive.
     - **Argumentativeness**: Makes one confrontational and possibly mistrustful.

  5. **Rationality/Neuroticism**: 
     - **Rationality**: Represents a calm and stable personality. When overextended, it can appear apathetic.
     - **Neuroticism**: Is characterized by frequent and intense negative emotions. Such individuals crave stability.

- Personalities are vast due to the interplay of determinism and chance. Human experiences, driven by genetics and unpredictable environmental interactions, result in unique personalities.

- Personalities are not static; they vary based on relationships. Depending on whom an individual interacts with (e.g., boss, parent, friend), their mannerisms, expressions, and even temperament can change, oscillating within the limits set by their inherent personality.

### VARIETIES OF INTELLIGENCE
**Summary & Clarification**:

To craft a believable character, ensure her intellectual and emotional capacities align with her actions and decisions in the story. A character's intelligence isn't just about IQ, or analytical and problem-solving skills. Consider multiple facets of intelligence:

1. **IQ**: Measures analytical thinking, spatial abilities, and problem-solving.
2. **EQ**: Represents emotional intelligence, assessing the ability to recognize and understand emotions in oneself and others.
3. **CIs (Creative Intelligences)**: 
   - **Creative Intelligence**: Gauges the power of imagination.
   - **Intellectual Curiosity**: Evaluates the desire to learn and understand.
   - **Cultural Intelligence**: Assesses adaptability in foreign or unfamiliar environments.

Moreover, consider the patterns in your character’s thinking. Each individual has personal strategies or habitual ways of dealing with relationships and challenges. If a particular approach has succeeded before, a person may be resistant to changing it. Therefore, ask: How adaptable is your character's mindset?

### ATTITUDES, BELIEFS, VALUES
**Summary & Clarification**:

To understand a character's core principles, delve into her attitudes, beliefs, and values. Explore her personal preferences, passions, and fears. Determine her outlook on life: is she hopeful or cynical? By questioning your character directly, you can uncover her self-perception. For instance:

- How does she identify herself: through personal qualities or her job?
- How independently defined is she, and how much does her profession dictate her identity?
- What are her aspirations and core responsibilities to herself and others?
- What boundaries has she set for herself and for her interactions with others?
- How does she perceive the intrinsic nature of humanity: inherently good, evil, or a mix of both?

By asking these questions, you gain a clearer understanding of the character's core convictions and the motivations that drive her actions.

### EMOTION, MOOD, TEMPERMENT
**Summary & Clarification**:

Emotions arise from shifts in what a character values. When a character's central value shifts from a positive state (like wealth) to a negative one (like poverty), they experience negative emotions. Conversely, moving from a negative state (like pain) to a positive one (like pleasure) results in positive emotions. However, how a character perceives these shifts is influenced by what they personally value. For example, the emotional impact of a romantic breakup depends on how the character perceives love, happiness, and companionship. 

A character's consistent reactions to various experiences indicate their mood. While kids exhibit temperaments, adults display personalities. Temperament is rooted in brain chemistry and is seen early in life, while personality evolves from interactions with the environment. Yet, an adult's core temperament remains reminiscent of their childhood nature. A clear example is the spectrum ranging from authoritarian to antiauthoritarian behaviors:

- **Authoritarians**: They lean towards militarism and religious fundamentalism, value family unity, and prioritize discipline and responsibility. They often view artists with suspicion and emphasize the importance of stability, even in unsatisfying jobs.
  
- **Antiauthoritarians**: They resist strict authority and traditional structures, often seeking personal fulfillment. They might change jobs frequently and are inclined to challenge or mock authority figures.

In essence, understanding a character's emotional responses, mood, temperament, and personality helps in creating a comprehensive and authentic portrayal.

### MIRROR, WORLD, AUTHOR
**Summary & Clarification**:

A character's present self is deeply influenced by her past, but her recollections of events are often subjective and altered interpretations rather than exact recounts. As soon as an event occurs, a character's mind starts to modify it, sometimes even adding fictional elements. This reconstructed memory then informs her understanding of the event and its impact on her identity. Different observers might have varying interpretations of the same event. As a writer, it's essential to consider these multiple perspectives to ensure that every trait, both explicit and implicit, effectively contributes to the character's portrayal.

### EXPRESSING CHARACTERIZATION
**Summary & Clarification**:

Characterization in writing can be conveyed in three ways: by stating what it is, what it's not, and through comparisons. There are nine specific techniques to flesh out a character:

1. **Simile**: This compares a character to someone or something else using "like" or "as". Example: "He looked like a dishonest Abe Lincoln."
2. **Metaphor**: Directly links a character to other entities without using "like" or "as". Example: "She’s the Tony Soprano of self-control."
3. **Correlations**: Links character traits with personal habits or possessions. Example: "She found her hair color in the same place she found her courage... a bottle."
4. **Contrasts**: Showcases how a character differs from a general group or stereotype. Example: "She’s unlike the typical college grad."
5. **Oppositions**: Highlights stark contradictions in a character. Example: "She’s an anti-intellectual PhD."
6. **Telling**: Descriptive language that paints a clear image. Example: "She stood six feet, two inches tall."
7. **Showing**: Provides actions or dialogues that give insights into the character. Example: "At six-two, she had to duck into my car."
8. **Self-assessments**: Insights into how a character views themselves. Example: "I’m a people person."
9. **Other-assessments**: Insights based on other characters' perceptions. Example: "She says she’s a people person, but..."

Hemingway's portrayal of Margot Macomber demonstrates these techniques. She's described explicitly as a beautiful woman of privilege, with implicit traits hinting at a life of luxury. The fact she endorsed a product she never used indicates her flexible morals, foreshadowing future events in the story.

### YES, BUT WHO IS SHE, REALLY?
**Summary & Clarification**:

Character development in storytelling goes beyond the superficial traits. While explicit and implicit characteristics provide a surface-level understanding of a character, there's always a deeper truth hidden beneath. Characterization showcases how a character presents themselves, but not necessarily their genuine essence. When an audience finds a characterization believable, they often wonder about the character's true nature and core values. The following chapter delves into these internal facets of a character's true persona, which are not immediately visible but reside within their psyche.

# 8 THE INNER CHARACTER
**Summary & Clarification**:

A character's outward appearance and behaviors, termed as characterization, only show a fraction of who they truly are. Beneath this facade lies their true character, a combination of their private feelings and concealed motives. When introduced to a character, the audience naturally tries to discern the character's genuine nature, seeking to understand their core values and motives. It's during moments of high stakes and challenges that a character's genuine nature is unveiled. Their actions, especially when faced with adversity, provide a glimpse into their true character: their honesty, kindness, strength, moral compass, and more.

The character themselves might not be fully aware of or might even avoid confronting these deep-seated traits. While they might wonder about others' perceptions or their subconscious motivations, the ultimate understanding of their character lies with the writer. The writer knows both the character's external representation and their innermost desires and fears. By blending the character's conscious thoughts with their subconscious motivations, the writer crafts a holistic and genuine representation of the character. The subsequent section would delve into what motivates such multifaceted characters.

## INSIDE-OUT MOTIVATIONS
**Summary & Clarification**:

Every individual possesses a range of inner motivations, from primal urges to elevated desires. These internal drives shape behaviors and decisions. Here are the twelve core motivations, ranging from basic to profound:

1. **Immortality**: The fear of death propels humans to leave lasting marks, such as art or monuments.
   
2. **Survival**: This fundamental drive pushes humans towards what they perceive as beneficial. People will often prioritize survival over moral considerations.
   
3. **Balance**: People innately seek equilibrium in their surroundings. Imbalances can threaten sanity, leading to actions that restore balance, such as seeking justice.

4. **Pleasure**: Humans are drawn to immediate pleasure, even if it's short-lived or leads to future pain.

5. **Sex**: Freud believed that sexual instincts are foundational to human behavior.

6. **Power**: According to Adler, people continuously assess their power in relation to others, driven by a desire to be on top.

7. **Empathy**: The desire to connect and belong forms groups or tribes. Empathy allows for collective feelings of pain or joy.

8. **More**: This includes:
   - **Greed**: A never-ending desire for more.
   - **Envy**: Desiring what someone else has, and sometimes wanting to destroy it if it's unattainable.
   - **Jealousy**: The heightened form of envy when a rival threatens one's position.

9. **Interest**: Engaging in tasks for their inherent satisfaction is crucial. The process often matters more than the result.

10. **Meaning**: After achieving goals, individuals often search for deeper purpose, as the lack of it can lead to feelings of emptiness.

11. **Fulfillment**: There's an innate drive to realize one's full potential, mentally and emotionally.

12. **Transcendence**: Jung proposed that people subconsciously yearn for a higher understanding, akin to godlike knowledge.

While society and its tools evolve, the core motivations driving human behavior remain consistent.

## OUTSIDE-IN MOTIVATIONS
**Summary & Clarification**:

From an external perspective, a storyteller examines the influence of societal structures like economics, politics, and religion on their characters. While these institutions can shape societal trends (like the impact of social media), attributing a character's motivation solely to these broad forces can be misleading. Conditions like poverty or wealth aren't direct causes of behaviors; they merely provide context. For instance, poverty doesn't directly cause crime. People from different socioeconomic backgrounds can commit crimes. 

For an external influence (like a TV ad) to drive a character's action, it must first engage their senses, resonate with their internal motivations, and then lead them to a decision. Major societal forces do affect characters, but each character processes these influences based on their unique personality, leading to unpredictable outcomes. A character's background doesn't necessarily dictate their behavior or personality; education doesn't always mean sophistication, ignorance doesn't always equate to crudeness, and being in a servant role doesn't mean one is subservient. Different characters can react differently to the same experiences, making their responses distinctive and unforeseeable.

### THE OBJECT OF DESIRE
**Summary & Clarification**:

In a classically told story, the protagonist starts with a relatively balanced life until an "inciting incident" disrupts this equilibrium. This incident could be positive (like Romeo falling for Juliet) or negative (like Hamlet learning of his father’s murder). This disruption awakens a subconscious desire in the protagonist to restore balance. This desire is termed the "super-objective". To achieve this equilibrium, the protagonist imagines a solution or change, often termed the "object of desire". If he can attain this object, he believes his life will regain balance. His pursuit of this object propels the story towards its climax. 

Different genres and plots focus on various objects of desire. For example:
- **Action Genre**: The object of desire is tangible. In "Jaws", it's the dead shark.
- **Education Plot**: The objective is more intangible, like self-discovery. In Ralph Ellison’s "Invisible Man", the protagonist seeks his identity.
  
Motivation remains a dormant force until an inciting incident triggers it, focusing the character's actions towards a specific desire. The inciting event is the catalyst that propels motivation into action, creating a goal or object of desire that guides the protagonist.

For instance:
- In "Romeo and Juliet", Romeo's passion (a motivation) is directed towards Juliet, leading him to pursue her as his ultimate desire.
- In "Vikings", an initial taste of victory drives a young warrior towards a desire for rule, with the throne as his goal.
- In stories like "A Confederacy of Dunces" or "Perfume", protagonists experience traumas that awaken deeper, often darker motivations, leading them towards unusual or harmful actions in pursuit of their desires.

### TRUE CHARACTER THROUGH CHOICES
**Summary & Clarification**:

To reveal a character's true nature in storytelling, it's not effective to solely rely on their outward behavior, what others say about them, or what they say about themselves. This is because external behaviors can be deceiving, comments by others might be biased or incorrect, and characters, like real people, can be as self-deceptive as they are self-aware. 

Instead, the most trustworthy way to unveil a character's true essence is through the choices they make, especially when faced with pressure or high stakes. At the heart of it, every individual's choices over their lifetime define who they are.

Drawing from nature, all living creatures inherently abide by the principle of choosing life and survival. Regardless of the creature, there's an intrinsic inclination to act in a way that they perceive as positive for their existence, even if it means reinterpreting what might conventionally be considered immoral. As an example, what's harmful for a gazelle (being hunted) is beneficial for a lion (getting food).

Given this fundamental natural law, if audiences understand a character's viewpoint, they can often predict how the character will act when faced with a choice. The character will always gravitate towards what they perceive as positive, rejecting the negative. This is a universal principle.

However, choices that merely contrast clear opposites, like poverty vs. wealth or ignorance vs. wisdom, can be seen as simplistic or predictable in storytelling. Such stark contrasts do not delve deep enough to unveil the complexities of a character's true nature.

### TRUE CHARACTER THROUGH DILEMMA
**Summary & Clarification**:

True character is profoundly revealed through dilemmas. Unlike straightforward decisions between clear opposites, dilemmas present a character with two equally compelling options, forcing them into a challenging decision that highlights their core values and motivations.

There are two types of dilemmas:

1. **Positive Dilemma**: A character is faced with two equally appealing choices but can only select one. An example is the romantic dilemma where a woman must choose between a kind, devoted partner and a passionate, unpredictable one.

2. **Negative Dilemma**: A character has to pick between two unappealing options. For instance, a woman may need to choose between marrying a man she doesn't love (to please her family) or facing familial rejection.

Dilemmas are potent storytelling tools because they place characters under intense pressure, driving audience curiosity about the character's ultimate decision. Simple choices might not tell us much, but how a character acts when faced with a dilemma provides deep insight into their essence.

Illustrations of such dilemmas in literature and film include:

- In *No Country for Old Men*, Llewelyn Moss decides to take stolen drug money, a decision which costs him and his wife their lives.
  
- In the play *Sweat* by Lynn Nottage, Cynthia faces the dilemma of supporting her working-class friends by striking or maintaining her new management position. She chooses the latter, sacrificing her friendships.

- In the novel *Less* by Andrew Sean Greer, the protagonist Arthur Less must decide between pursuing full creative accomplishment with its inherent challenges or settling for a less demanding but more comfortable life. He opts for comfort.

Such decisions under duress not only advance the plot but deeply expose the character's nature.

### TRUE CHARACTER THROUGH ANTAGONISM
**Summary & Clarification**:

True character is revealed through how one reacts to antagonism and the choices they make under pressure.

1. **Antagonistic Forces & Choices**: When a character acts, especially in risky situations, they face opposing forces. Their reactions and decisions under these circumstances are highly revealing of their true nature. For a choice to be meaningful in determining character, it should come with a risk.

2. **Pressure**: The more intense the pressure, the more telling the choice is about the character's true nature. For instance, honesty is trivial if there's nothing at risk. However, if one tells the truth when lying could save them, it reveals a depth of character.

3. **Complex Characters**: These characters are situated along spectra of values, from positives like love and courage, to negatives like hate and cowardice. Where they stand under various pressures makes them multidimensional.

4. **Guiding Principles for Writers**:
   - A character's choices under pressure and risk reveal their true character.
   - The more significant the risk and pressure, the deeper the revelation about the character.
   - The more autonomous the choice, the more it reveals about the character’s identity.

5. **Examples**:
   - Characters like Othello, Lear, and Macbeth have their paths relatively set for them. Hamlet, in contrast, has an array of free choices, making him a more complex character.
   - In "Succession", initially, Kendall's character seems weak because of limited choices under his father’s dominance. But as he starts making riskier decisions independently, his character deepens, drawing more empathy from the audience.

In essence, the essence of a character isn’t just in their actions but in the choices they make, especially when faced with dilemmas and opposition.

### TRUE CHARACTER AND EMOTION
**Summary & Clarification**:

**True Character and Emotion**:

1. **Value Change and Emotion**: A character’s emotion is influenced by the change in value in a scene. A shift from negative to positive evokes a positive emotion, and vice versa. Emotion is essentially a byproduct of change.

2. **Biochemical Nature of Emotion**: Emotions are triggered by biochemical reactions in the brain. For instance, a pleasing sight releases dopamine and serotonin, resulting in pleasure, while an unpleasant image may elicit disgust due to its impact on certain brain areas. Over time, the body balances out these reactions, making intense feelings temporary.

3. **Different Emotions**: Traditional psychology lists six basic emotions: joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise. The author expands on these by offering twelve emotions in pairs of opposites: Love/Hate, Amity/Anger, Joy/Grief, Surprise/Shock, Pleasure/Disgust, and Courage/Fear.

4. **Emotion vs. Feeling**: While often used interchangeably, they differ in impact and duration. Emotion is immediate and short-lived, like joy or grief. Feeling is more prolonged and subtle, such as happiness or sadness. Feelings often persist even when the original cause is forgotten, and they can shape a person’s character over a lifetime.

5. **Role of Characterization**: Knowing a character’s underlying emotion is just the beginning. The distinct personality of a character refines and shapes that emotion. For instance, while joy in one character may manifest as an exuberant dance, in another it might be a subtle smile.

In essence, understanding a character’s emotions and feelings, and how they are influenced by changes in their world, is essential for writers. This insight helps give depth to characters, making them more relatable and real to the audience.

### TRUE CHARACTER AND REACTIONS
**Summary & Clarification**:

**True Character and Reactions**:

1. **Limited Actions, Varied Reactions**: While there's a limited number of fundamental actions a person can take in life (like choosing to educate oneself, marry, work, etc.), the reactions to these actions can be infinitely varied. For instance, while many might choose to study, their individual reactions to the challenges of education will differ widely.

2. **Core Identity and Individuality**: A character's decisions when faced with obstacles reveal their core identity. However, their unique reactions to those decisions distinguish them from others and make them unique.

3. **Illustration with Casablanca**: In the film "Casablanca," Victor Lazlo's answer to why he risks his life is a typical idealist response. Rick Blaine's retort, suggesting that the end of civilization might be a mercy, is a unique reaction that defines his character. It's Rick's distinct reactions that make him memorable and different from other characters.

4. **Principle for Character Creation**: While actions taken under pressure reveal the true essence of a character, it's the unique, nuanced reactions that make a character stand out and become intriguing to the audience.

In essence, for a well-rounded and memorable character, it's crucial to focus not just on the decisions they make but also on their unique reactions to situations, as these reactions give them depth and individuality.

### TRUE CHARACTER AND FREE WILL
**Summary & Clarification**:

**True Character and Free Will**:

**Central Theme**: The nature of free will in characters, whether they truly act on their own accord or are merely driven by the author's hand.

1. **Duality of Perspective**: From the writer's viewpoint, characters are bound by the narrative, with every decision shaped by the author's whim. But, to readers or audiences, characters seem to possess independent free will, acting on their motivations.

2. **The Matrix Context**: The film explores the concept of free will versus determinism through Neo's journey to understand and break free from an artificially created reality.

3. **The Age-Old Debate**: There are two main views on free will:
   - **Against Free Will**: All actions are causally determined by preceding events. Since nothing can occur without a cause, true free will (an uncaused choice) doesn't exist.
   - **For Free Will**: We have the power of independent choice, and even if influenced by factors like upbringing or genetics, our decisions ultimately feel real and consequential. This perspective posits that without a belief in choice, societal structures would crumble, and chaos would ensue. Free will is essential for creativity, innovation, and change.

4. **The Dual Nature of Narrative Choice**: In stories, character decisions can seem both free and predetermined. At the beginning of a story, anything seems possible. But by the end, given what we've learned about the character and their environment, their decisions seem inevitable. This duality reflects the coexistence of free will (looking forward) and determinism (looking back).

5. **Four Possible Decision Pathways for Characters**:
   - **External Circumstances**: The environment or external events drive the character's decisions.
   - **Subconscious Decisions**: Choices the character might not even realize they've made.
   - **Instinctive Choices**: Quick, gut-driven decisions based on immediate feelings or thoughts.
   - **Rational Decision Making**: Slow, analytical decisions, often involving deliberate thought and weighing pros and cons.

6. **Author's Role**: Regardless of the perspective on free will, the final choices characters make in a story are ultimately determined by the author.

In essence, the debate on free will versus determinism is complex and multifaceted, influencing how characters are perceived and how stories unfold. While characters may seem to act on their own accord to readers or audiences, they remain bound by the writer's narrative choices.

# 9 THE DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER
## A UNITY OF OPPOSITES
**Summary & Clarification**:

**Central Theme**: The nature of character complexity arises from a unity of opposing traits or characteristics.

1. **Three Layers of Character**:
   - **Outer Layer**: The visible characterization that often hides the real nature of a character.
   - **Inner Layer**: The true character or the genuine attributes of the character.
   - **Hidden Layer**: The subconscious aspect, including deep-seated desires, habits, and underlying temperaments.

2. **Binding Force**: These three layers, despite their distinctions, are unified by the power of contradiction. This is the force that ensures they don't disintegrate, giving a character depth and cohesion.

3. **Heraclitus' Philosophy**: Drawing from the ancient philosopher Heraclitus, the text suggests that everything in reality maintains its existence through a balance of contradictions. Just as contrasting elements like hot/cold give rise to the concept of temperature, human beings embody opposing aspects that create a unified identity.

4. **Contradictions in Humans**: Every individual encompasses contradictions - they are simultaneously dying as they are living, they are awake while they dream, and regardless of age, they can be perceived as both young and old in relation to others.

5. **Unity of Opposites**: This principle implies that within every character, contrasting traits coexist, adding depth and complexity. This concept emphasizes that character complexity is not just about layering distinct traits but about intertwining opposing elements harmoniously.

6. **Storytelling Impact**: Characters developed with this principle of contradiction become more engaging and relatable, as they reflect the inherent complexities and paradoxes of human nature. Such characters bring depth to stories, allowing for a richer exploration of themes like good vs. evil or truth vs. deceit.

In essence, the intricacy of characters comes from a harmony of contradictions within them, and it's this dynamic tension that makes them compelling and lifelike in storytelling.

## CHARACTER DIMENSION
**Summary & Clarification**:

**Central Theme**: The complexity and richness of a character are built on the inherent contradictions within their nature, giving them multiple dimensions.

1. **Origins of Human Nature**: Human emotions and behaviors have ancient origins, long before philosophical or religious teachings tried to shape or refine them.

2. **Paradox in Humanity**: People frequently exhibit opposing emotions and behaviors. For instance, they might love and hate their family simultaneously or cherish nature while also harming it. These inherent contradictions are integral aspects of human nature.

3. **Character Dynamics**: Characters that exhibit these dualities—shifting from one trait to its opposite and back—appear more layered and complex. Their behaviors and reactions differ depending on their relationships and internal conflicts.

4. **Sadomasochistic Example**: The example of a high-powered executive seeking both dominance in her professional life and submission in her personal life epitomizes the contradictions within a person. The term "sadomasochist" captures this dual nature.

5. **Types vs. Dimensional Characters**: 
   - **Types**: Characters that present a singular, unvaried behavior or trait, making them somewhat predictable. Examples include the typical portrayal of a nurse, villain, or superhero.
   - **Dimensional Characters**: These characters have multiple layers or dimensions, stemming from inherent contradictions. They capture our attention because they are unpredictable and multifaceted.

6. **Dimension's Appeal**: The unpredictability of dimensional characters sparks audience curiosity. Because they house opposing traits, it's captivating to see which trait will surface in any given situation.

In essence, characters with built-in contradictions or opposing traits add depth, unpredictability, and intrigue to a story, making them more relatable and engaging for audiences.

## COMPLEXITY IN SIX DIMENSIONS
**Summary & Clarification**:

**Title**: **Complexity in Character Dimensions**

Characters possess a multitude of dimensions that make them compelling and intricate. These dimensions are often contradictory in nature. Here's a breakdown of the six distinct dimensions of complexity in characters:

1. **Contradiction in Characterization**:
   - Characters show opposing outer traits, making them intriguing. For instance, a woman who meticulously applies makeup but neglects her dental hygiene.
   - Such traits are visible to others, but characters often rationalize them, not viewing them as contradictory.

2. **Contradiction Between Characterization and True Character**:
   - The outer appearance may belie an inner nature. An elderly woman, seemingly frail, may still harbor youthful dreams of romantic love.

3. **Contradiction Between Characterization and Subconscious Desire**:
   - Characters may display an active outer behavior but possess a contrasting subconscious. For example, a hyperactive woman may become calm and focused only when faced with danger.
   - These contradictions hint at hidden desires or motivations.

4. **Contradiction Between Two Conscious Desires**:
   - Characters grapple with two opposing conscious desires, like a woman torn between loyalty to her husband and attraction to her lover.
   - Some playwrights symbolize this conflict by splitting a character's mind into two distinct characters.

5. **Contradiction Between a Conscious Desire and a Subconscious Desire**:
   - Characters struggle with desires they're aware of and those buried in their subconscious. For example, a person may deeply love someone but fear commitment.
   - Literary and TV examples, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or Walter White's transformation into Heisenberg in "Breaking Bad", depict this conflict.

6. **Contradiction Between Two Subconscious Motivations**:
   - Characters may unknowingly hold two opposing subconscious desires. For instance, the need to prioritize family over personal ambitions versus the need to prioritize personal goals over family.
   - Popular stories, like "Hamlet" or "Cinderella", use multiple characters to depict a single character's subconscious conflicts.

**Key Points**:
- Characters are enriched by these inherent contradictions.
- Contradictions make characters unpredictable, engaging the audience's curiosity.
- Dimensions should be consistent but also variable, allowing characters to evolve.
- True character depth is achieved when contradictions seem unresolvable, like an atheist yearning for the eternal or a scientist disbelieving in free will while making choices based on it.

In essence, the dimensions rooted in contradictions give depth and richness to characters, making them more captivating and relatable.

## THE DEFINING DIMENSION 
**Summary & Clarification**:
Every character has multiple dimensions, but not all of these dimensions are equally important. While a protagonist might possess several dimensions and supporting roles may have one or two, one specific dimension usually stands out more prominently, shaping the character's core essence. This primary dimension, referred to as the "defining dimension," represents the most significant contradiction within a character's nature, setting them apart from others. 

For instance, when considering the many facets of Graham Greene's personality, the most defining dimension might be his inner conflict between being an artist and a hack. Although Greene exhibited many other contradictions, this particular struggle was uniquely his and truly captured his essence. 

**Key Point**: While characters can have multiple contradictory dimensions, one of them typically dominates, capturing the character's unique identity and defining their essence.

## CASE STUDY: ODYSSEUS
Homer’s epics, the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_, are pivotal in European culture, with Odysseus as the centerpiece of the narrative, celebrated as history's first multidimensional character. Across both tales, Odysseus faces a myriad of challenges — from battling in the Trojan War to navigating his way home against supernatural odds.

Odysseus's character can be dissected into eight contrasting dimensions:

1. **Pragmatic/Idealistic**: While Odysseus is practical on the battlefield, employing whatever means necessary to achieve victory, he also holds to idealistic beliefs of honor and valiance.
    
2. **Obedient/Defiant**: He respects authority, especially King Agamemnon, but is unafraid to defy commands if he deems them wrong.
    
3. **Truthful/Deceitful**: Trusted for his counsel and honesty during the war, he resorts to lies and deceptions during his journey home, masterfully crafting tales to navigate complex situations.
    
4. **Brilliant/Blundering**: Renowned for the genius Trojan Horse strategy, Odysseus also makes grievous mistakes, like angering Poseidon by taunting Polyphemus.
    
5. **Protecting/Jeopardizing**: He cares deeply for his crew, protecting them in various circumstances, but also inadvertently places them in harm's way.
    
6. **Honorable/Thieving**: A respected warrior during the Trojan War, Odysseus turns to piracy on his voyage home.
    
7. **Cool/Raging**: Calm and level-headed in combat situations, his temper flares in personal matters, leading to the massacre of the Suitors and treacherous servants upon his return.
    
8. **Faithful/Unfaithful**: Despite his affairs with other women, he remains deeply loyal to his wife, Penelope, especially when tempted by the goddess Calypso.
    

These dynamic contradictions give Odysseus a depth that sets him apart, making him unpredictable and relatable. His most defining trait lies in his balance of brilliance and impulsiveness. Odysseus's character set a precedent for multidimensional protagonists in literature, influencing iconic characters from Beowulf to Jay Gatsby to Thomas Cromwell.

## CASE STUDY: TONY SOPRANO 
**Summary and Clarification:**

David Chase's character, Tony Soprano, from the TV series "The Sopranos," is explored as an example of a deeply dimensional character. Over the show's eighty-six episodes, Tony displays a myriad of conflicting emotions and actions, making him a highly complex character:

1. **Guilt-ridden/Sociopath**: Tony often displays sociopathic tendencies, showing a lack of remorse for violent actions. Yet, he also experiences deep guilt, leading to panic attacks and visits to a psychiatrist.
 
2. **Proud/Shamed**: Tony takes pride in his son's kindness but feels shame over his son's perceived weaknesses.
 
3. **Calculating/Intuitive**: Tony is methodical in his decisions, but he also acts on intuition, such as when he kills a friend based on a dream.

4. **Depressed/Optimistic**: He wrestles with bouts of despair and optimism.

5. **Loyal/Treacherous**: Tony remains loyal to his family and the mafia, but frequently betrays his wife with other women.

6. **Calm/Panicked**: He's often cool-headed, yet experiences panic attacks.

7. **Fearless/Terrified**: While unafraid of gangster threats, he's terrified of terrorism.

8. **Sneering/Envying**: Tony looks down on everyday life but secretly wishes for it.

9. **Kills/Saves**: He can be murderous towards people but is protective of animals.

10. **Loves women/Fears women**: He is a womanizer but has deep-rooted fears, evidenced by nightmares.

11. **Loves family/Hates family**: He has a love-hate relationship with his family members, including his mother and uncle.

12. **Loves life/Loves death**: Tony revels in the joys of life but is also drawn to the allure of death.

The depth and breadth of Tony's character surpasses even Shakespearean characters like Hamlet. While Hamlet's narrative explores change and transformation, "The Sopranos" ultimately presents a character in Tony who, despite his vast dimensions, does not undergo core change.

# 10 THE COMPLEX CHARACTER
## COMPLEXITY THROUGH ANTAGONISM 
**Summary and Clarification:**

Stoic philosophers, originating around 300 BC, believed in a preordained life, asserting that the gods, or Fate, determined all events of life in advance. This belief persists today when people attribute events, such as tragedies, to "God’s will." On the contrary, Epicurean philosophers emphasized the power of free will. They believed that while unforeseen events could disturb us, our responses, steered by our will, shape our destinies. This aligns with the aphorism from Heraclitus: "Character is destiny." The more contemporary view, influenced by thinkers like Carl Jung, holds that while external forces may seem unpredictable, much of life's trajectory is governed by internal, often subconscious, forces. 

To illustrate this point, consider two ships in a storm: both are subject to the same external forces, but their outcomes differ due to the decisions and capabilities of their respective captains. This is encapsulated by Cassius's quote in "The Tragedy of Julius Caesar": "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."

As a person matures, their values are shaped by both external influences and internal convictions. These convictions lead to choices, which in turn reveal and mold character. A person's character is deeply influenced by:

1. **Core Beliefs**: These drive decisions and are in turn reflected by those decisions.
2. **Choices under Pressure**: These not only disclose a person's nature but also shape their evolution.
3. **Variety of Challenges**: The greater the diversity of challenges faced, the broader the range of choices made.
4. **Complexity of Choices**: This determines the multifaceted nature of a person's character.
5. **Dimensionality**: It depends on the range of conflicting forces experienced by the individual. 

These forces can be external, such as natural disasters or societal pressures, or internal, like conflicting desires and emotions. The combination of these levels of antagonism can give rise to a deeply multidimensional character.
## PHYSICAL CONFLICTS
**Summary and Clarification:**

Stories feature multiple levels of conflict, with the outermost level encompassing physical world conflicts:

1. **Natural Environments**: These represent the unpredictability and indifference of nature, such as tornadoes or the fierceness of wild animals.
2. **Man-made Environments**: Human creations can have both beautiful and destructive effects. This includes the wonders of civilizations as well as the challenges they introduce, such as pollution or global warming.
3. **Bodily Environment**: This represents the challenges and limitations of the human body, including illness, aging, and physical insecurities.
4. **Temporal Environment**: Time encompasses everything, but it also brings about the end of everything, emphasizing the transitory nature of life.

To illustrate the concept of physical conflict in characterization, consider a young man who loves daring ski jumps. His behavior, such as wearing expensive clothing to gain attention or being overly conscious of time, paints him as an athletic, impatient, self-centered, and immature individual. However, for this character to be the protagonist of a story, he requires greater depth. 

To add complexity, we can explore the contradictions in his character. For instance:

- His apparent vanity might actually mask deep self-doubt.
- His athleticism might be artificially boosted by performance-enhancing drugs.
- His love for adrenaline-fueled stunts could be a way to cope with the pain of losing a parent or even symbolize suicidal tendencies.
- His anxiety might only find relief in the freeing moments when he's airborne.

When we consider these opposing traits, the character becomes multifaceted and more suitable as a story's protagonist.
## SOCIAL CONFLICTS
**Summary and Clarification:**

Social structures significantly influence individuals' behaviors and personal struggles. These institutions, with their established hierarchies, determine roles for individuals, often leading to reduced personal responsibility. While the upper echelons may be efficient, they can also be callous. Although these structures offer benefits, such as education and support, they often diminish the individual, leading to a dichotomy where these systems protect but also oppress.

Two ideological extremes govern institutions: "I am my brother’s keeper" and "Every man for himself." Predatory capitalism epitomizes the latter, fostering environments where sociopathy thrives. On the opposite end, absolute governments claim to care for their people but impose choices upon them. Between these extremes are meritocracies that can evolve into oligarchies. For example, the foundation of the United States, while progressive, was also built upon various forms of discrimination.

One of the dark sides of institutions is their potential to encourage harmful behaviors, which individuals might not perform in isolation. Mobs might encourage a suicidal person to jump, or large crowds in events might inadvertently trample one another.

To survive in such a structured world, individuals often adopt varied social personas, based on the institutions or scenarios they interact with. For instance, a character may behave differently when interacting with a professor, a religious leader, a governmental entity, an online group, or a military officer. Such traits can define a character, but for depth and complexity, there must be contradictions in their behavior.

For example, a character might exhibit humility in front of his professor but might be boastful among peers. Such a duality in traits can give a character depth, making him suitable for a central role in a gripping story.
## PERSONAL CONFLICTS
**Summary and Clarification:**

In the realm of relationships, public and personal ones operate on different criteria. In public relationships, outcomes are paramount, while in personal ones, intentions carry more weight. This means, in a professional setting, results matter most, but in intimate settings, the intent behind actions holds more significance. A failed investment is criticized regardless of good intentions, but a misstep in a romantic relationship might be forgiven if it wasn't intentional.

The essence that differentiates these relationships is intimacy, which involves sharing personal thoughts and feelings not expressed publicly. This closeness can lead to either joy or pain, depending on the individuals involved. As individuals grow, their experiences with intimacy shape their core selves, ranging from abundant loving interactions to singularly cold ones. However, it's possible for people to have relationships without real intimacy, where power dynamics dominate. 

Personal conflicts, rooted in deep feelings, tend to be more impactful in storytelling than broader societal issues. For instance, Shakespeare's "Macbeth" or "Othello" have deeper emotional resonance than "Coriolanus" or "The Winter’s Tale" because they focus on personal tragedies.

Every intimate relationship brings out a unique side of an individual. If that relationship ends, the person doesn't just lose a loved one, but also that specific version of themselves. To create richer characters, one can juxtapose a character's trait with a contrasting intimate behavior, adding depth and complexity to their persona.

1. **Generous/Selfish**: A seemingly generous waiter always bakes extra cookies and remembers family birthdays. To others, he appears to be a kind-hearted, love-seeking individual. However, when he wins the lottery, he displays his true colors. Instead of being charitable with his newfound wealth, he hoards it and enjoys the attention it brings. His previous acts were not selfless; they were attempts to gain love and appreciation. Now with money, he no longer seeks approval and relishes the attention people give to win his favor.

2. **Supportive/Subversive**: A seemingly supportive husband takes care of household chores and listens to his wife's complaints patiently. In public, after a few drinks, he belittles her with subtle jokes, making her seem foolish. He cleverly masks these insults with endearing terms, manipulating her into appearing agreeable. The stories paint a picture to others that his wife is naive, but she remains silent, likely out of love or fear.

3. **Guilt/Forgiveness**: A hardworking individual vents his work-related frustrations on his children, resulting in repeated instances of abuse. Upon revealing a medical condition linked to stress, he attempts to win their sympathy. If he keeps his ailment a secret and suffers a health-related episode, his children might view him as a martyr. By leveraging his condition, he seeks absolution for his past wrongs. Whether he shares or hides his condition, he manipulates their emotions to gain forgiveness.

The presented characters use duality in their traits (generous/selfish, supportive/subversive, guilt/forgiveness) to add depth and complexity. When building characters, contrasting positive and negative attributes can create multifaceted personas. Examples include hard/soft, sweet/sour, and calm/hyper.

## INNER DIMENSIONS 
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters with intricate inner dimensions often transform stories to focus on their internal conflicts, sometimes even more than their external challenges. Two notable examples are Raskolnikov from "Crime and Punishment" and Katherine in "Lady Macbeth". 

As a storyteller delves deeper into a character, the pivotal moments that truly shape the narrative are those that occur beneath the surface, in the character's psyche. The writer looks beyond what the character says or does, aiming to decipher the underlying psychology and how external events affect the character internally. This exploration can lead to the character undergoing a transformation, either growing or regressing in some way.

The process is iterative: delving into the character's mind can lead to a reimagining of events in the story, and these revised events can then further inform the character's development. Some characters, like Shakespeare's Hamlet or Virginia Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway, exhibit cognitive dissonance — they are trapped in the gap between thought and action. They wrestle with memories, desires, and anxieties, constantly trying to differentiate between reality and illusion, truth and falsehood, until they take decisive action.

Oftentimes, the source of a character's complexity comes from the darker side of human nature, which many might conceal but writers explore. This depth can be traced back to both conscious contradictions in their thought processes and deeper, unspoken conflicts in the subconscious.
## CONSCIOUS CONFLICTS
**Summary and Clarification:**

Complex characters possess internal contradictions that they are either aware of or can somewhat sense. These characters recognize their fluctuations between clarity and confusion, kindness and cruelty. They often attempt to reconcile or manage these inner conflicts. Some contradictions are rooted in cognitive abilities, such as being Intelligent yet sometimes Unintelligent, while others are more emotional, like fluctuating between being Impulsive and Reflective.

Societal institutions have been established to help individuals address some of these internal struggles. For instance, Alcoholics Anonymous supports individuals battling addiction (navigating between craving and rejecting alcohol), and Buddhism helps individuals with a "Monkey Mind", a term used to describe a restless, inconsistent thought process akin to a monkey jumping from one idea to another.

In essence, the private realm of a character is a space where they grapple with their inner contradictions, which can be cognitive or emotional in nature.
## LESS VERSUS MORE
**Summary and Clarification:**

Consider a character content with simplicity and solitude, devoid of any burning desires typical of a protagonist. However, if an event sparks a newfound desire for recognition and external success, a tension arises within him. This conflict between wanting recognition and maintaining privacy could make him the centerpiece of a story, as seen with the character Arthur Less in Andrew Sean Greer's novel "Less." This dynamic, balancing the desire for less with the lure of more, and the tension between inner and outer experiences, is also seen in Shakespeare's Hamlet. Hamlet is torn by his aversion to both the external corruption of the world and his internal struggles, leading to his indecisiveness and potential descent into madness. He is a mosaic of contradictions: he's introspective yet dramatic, deeply sorrowful but sharply witty, and though highly self-aware, he's oblivious to how he impacts others. This duality renders both his internal and external worlds as seeming void of meaning, edging him closer to insanity.
## BELIEF VERSUS SKEPTICISM
**Summary and Clarification:**

Beliefs, even if based on illusions, unify societies. When these illusions are debunked, societal unity shatters, leading to upheavals or revolutions. However, post-revolution, society often latches onto another belief or illusion, rebuilding its institutions. Using this context, novelist Joseph Conrad categorized characters as "Idiots" (those who blindly believe in illusions) and "Convicts" (those who see through the deceptions). Idiots are often the heroes or villains, while Convicts, recognizing the randomness of the universe, tend to be passive, posing challenges for writers since action-driven stories typically need characters with firm beliefs. 

Consider a skeptic who doubts everything. As a static character, he might be fit for a side role or a short narrative, but not a main story. However, introducing a contradiction in his beliefs can add depth and potential. For instance, having such a skeptic fall in love with someone who's a staunch believer can create a dynamic narrative around his internal conflict. 

Characters can have multiple dimensions. Modern narratives, especially long series, require characters that remain intriguing over extended periods. Hence, drawing from a wide range of contradictory traits - like Independent/Dependent or Neuroticism/Stability - can provide endless possibilities for creating multifaceted characters. The only boundary is a writer's creativity.
## CONSCIOUS VERSUS SUBCONSCIOUS CONFLICT
**Summary and Clarification:**

The subconscious mind is a deep, active realm, contrary to the notion of it being inert, as the term "unconscious" might suggest. This subconscious part rises to the surface during dreams, taking form through symbols and irrational narratives. Even in our waking hours, this hidden self heavily influences our desires, often without our conscious awareness. This gives rise to the notion that, while we think we are in control of our actions, there's also a hidden force within us that influences our decisions. As Freud indicated, some behaviors and feelings might seem foreign to our conscious self.

The line between the subconscious and conscious is blurred. It's challenging to discern when a behavior or thought transitions from one realm to the other. While this guide separates the two for clarity, creating multifaceted characters requires recognizing and blending these aspects uniquely for each character.

Many complex characters grapple with their subconscious, especially when confronting darker or more violent urges. Recognizing both the virtuous and darker parts of the subconscious is key to self-awareness. While the positive traits are apparent, acknowledging and understanding the dark side demands bravery. When a significant event disrupts a character's life in a story, it typically ignites two desires: a conscious, tangible goal to restore balance, and an underlying, dormant desire from the subconscious that suddenly awakens.
## SELF VERSUS OTHER
**Summary and Clarification:**

The primal part of our brain has two main directives: personal survival and the continuation of our genes. Often, preserving the gene pool takes precedence, which is evident in actions like parents risking their lives for their children, soldiers dying for their country, or believers taking extreme actions for their faith. This constant tension between self-preservation and the welfare of others (or one's offspring) drives many of our subconscious decisions.

An illustrative example can be found in the movie "Kramer vs. Kramer". In the story, Ted Kramer, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, starts as a self-focused individual, more engrossed in his work than in his family. When his wife unexpectedly leaves him and their son, Ted's life is thrown into chaos. Through this upheaval, a dormant desire emerges in Ted: a deep-seated need to be a caring and devoted person. By the end of the story, his love for his son overpowers his self-centered tendencies, leading him to prioritize his son's needs over his own.
## ILLUSION VERSUS DELUSION
**Summary and Clarification:**

Subconscious conflicts can revolve around how characters interpret reality, specifically the tension between illusion and delusion. While an illusion refers to a mistaken perception or belief, such as seeing a mirage, a delusion is a firm belief in something that is not true and is often linked to mental disorders. 

In Tennessee Williams's "A Streetcar Named Desire", Blanche DuBois is a prime example. In her past, she chased unrealistic romantic ideals, which led to disastrous consequences including a bad marriage, loss of her home, and a stint in prostitution. Still, she clings to her fantasies of a better life. Over time, due to alcohol, trauma, and abuse, her self-deceptions deepen into full-blown delusions, resulting in her confinement to a mental institution. The trajectory of characters struggling with such deep-seated contradictions often culminates in tragic outcomes, like death or madness.
## CASE STUDY: ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
**Summary and Clarification:**

Shakespeare's characters, Antony and Cleopatra, are multifaceted individuals whose internal dimensions span multiple layers, revealing a blend of societal expectations and personal desires. 

Antony experiences a tug-of-war between his political responsibilities and his passion for Cleopatra. This conflict underscores the broader battle between reason and emotion. Despite his clarity on Roman politics and his role within it, his intense attraction to Cleopatra often eclipses his judgment. This duality is evident in his behavior: as a fierce general in battle and a devoted lover in private. This suggests that for Antony, both war and love serve as outlets for his intense passions.

Cleopatra, on the other hand, is a master of perception. She possesses a range of contrasting traits — from royal decadence to innocent charm. Her emotions, whether they be rage, greed, or desire, are expertly channeled into performances that bewitch those around her. Instead of appearing as flaws, her behaviors are perceived as virtues, thanks to her charisma. Like Antony, Cleopatra grapples with a balance between her strategic ambitions and unbridled passion.

The essence of their tragedy, as suggested, might not just be in the denial of their desires, but in the realization of those desires at a heavy cost.
## CHARACTER CONFLICT IN DEPTH
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters are often visualized through spatial descriptors like "deep" or "shallow," but to craft a genuinely complex character, authors delve into the soul's intricacies. The instinctual human ability to judge character depth upon first meeting is labeled as the "First Impression," which evolved primarily as a trust assessment tool. Characters perceived to have deeper dimensions naturally elicit empathy and trust from readers and audiences.

Here are ten traits, often indicating depth in a character:

1. **Ironic Self-Awareness**: Avoids self-deception. Example: Claire Underwood from *House of Cards*.
 
2. **Insight into Others**: Recognizes societal pretensions. Example: Madame Merle from *The Portrait of a Lady*.

3. **Intelligence**: Demonstrates deep thinking and logical application. Example: Miss Marple from Agatha Christie's works.

4. **A History of Suffering**: Depth often emerges from pain. Pain challenges one's self-perception and can push a person towards wisdom. Example: Mike Ehrmantraut from *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul*.

5. **Broad Experience over Time**: Depth requires a variety of experiences over a long time. Example: Claudia Hampton from *Moon Tiger*.

6. **Focused Attention**: The character is an active listener and observer. Example: Don Vito Corleone from *The Godfather*.

7. **Love of Beauty**: A heightened sensitivity to beauty. Example: Aaliya Sohbi from *An Unnecessary Woman*.

8. **Calm**: Maintains composure under pressure. Example: Captain Augustus McCrae from *Lonesome Dove*.

9. **Cynic and Skeptic**: Is wary of superficial hope and trusts only after personal assessment. Example: Mama Nadi from *Ruined*.

10. **A Searcher for Meaning**: Questions life's inherent purpose and seeks deeper meaning. Example: Benna Carpenter from *Anagrams*.

Many of these traits combine to shape the "antihero" archetype — a complex character, both cynical and sensitive, often portrayed by actors like Humphrey Bogart and Denzel Washington.
## LIFE IN THE SUBTEXT
**Summary and Clarification:**

Characters in a story have two aspects: text and subtext. 

**Text** refers to a character's overt behaviors, including their actions and spoken words. This is what readers and audiences directly observe and is essential for a character's characterization.

**Subtext**, on the other hand, encompasses a character's conscious but unexpressed thoughts and feelings, as well as their subconscious desires and moods which they might not even be aware of.

Minor characters generally operate on the text level alone. They are straightforward, and their actions directly reflect their characterization. There is no depth or hidden agenda behind them.

Major characters, however, have a more profound subtext beneath their text. While they act in a certain way on the surface (the text), there's often a deeper, sometimes hidden meaning or motivation behind their actions (the subtext). This depth intrigues readers and audiences, prompting them to question and explore the real essence of these characters. When engaging with such characters, readers and audiences often feel they are delving deep into the character's psyche, understanding them sometimes even better than the characters understand themselves.

This exploration of depth is intuitive. Different people might interpret a character's depth differently based on the subtext, leading to varying interpretations of the same character. Characters like Hamlet, Anna Karenina, and Walter White, are debated extensively in literary circles because of their rich subtext, and interpretations can vary widely.

Characters also probe into the depths of other characters within the story, trying to discern their true motives and feelings. Some introspective characters even reflect on their own actions and motivations, leading to self-discovery or further confusion. Examples of such introspective characters are found in novels like *A Fan’s Notes*, *The Sea, The Sea*, and *The Woman Upstairs*.

In essence, while the external behaviors (text) of characters are readily apparent, the inner workings (subtext) remain elusive, urging readers and audiences to become 'psychics' and delve deeper into understanding the true nature of these characters.



# 11 THE COMPLETED CHARACTER
**Summary and Clarification:**

To craft a perfect character:

1. **Begin with a foundation** of a multifaceted personality. This character has a lot of potential, but just like any individual, they're still a work in progress.
 
2. **Progressively develop** this character through the story, allowing them to make decisions and take actions under pressure. This will gradually unlock their untapped potential.

3. **Peak their development at the climax** of the story. Here, the character should undergo a transformative experience, pushing them to the boundaries of their emotional and mental capacities. They should leave no stone unturned in their personal journey, fully expressing and living every emotion, revealing every hidden aspect, and using every resource they have.

4. **Four major stages** facilitate this character development: 
   - **Preparation**: Set up the character's background, motivations, and potential.
   - **Revelation**: Gradually unveil the depths of the character and their inner conflicts.
   - **Change**: Allow the character to evolve through experiences and decisions.
   - **Completion**: The character reaches their full potential, achieving a sense of completion by the end of the story.

In essence, to craft the ultimate character, start them with promise, let them evolve and be challenged, and bring them to a fulfilling completion by the story's end.

## FOUR MAJOR STEPS OF CHARACTER DESIGN 
### 1. Preparation 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**FOUR MAJOR STEPS OF CHARACTER DESIGN:**

**1. Preparation:**  
- **Principle:** As a story begins, major characters are not fully realized in their mental, emotional, and moral capacities. They're like unfinished pieces, unaware of the depths and range of experiences they are capable of. They're set with potential experiences and feelings they've never encountered before.
   - **Character Need:** Think of this as the gap in a character's experience or their undeveloped traits. It might be a part of them that's untested or a part of their life they haven't yet explored to its fullest. 
   - **Assessment Before Introduction:** Before introducing a protagonist, an author must evaluate their potential. Consider their emotional intelligence (EQ), their intelligence quotient (IQ), their level of willpower, the depth of their empathy, their courage, etc. Think about their current state and how future experiences could mold them.
   - **Inciting Incident:** This is a pivotal event that sets the protagonist on their journey. This event should challenge the protagonist in a way that aligns with their "need" and pushes them towards realizing their full potential. 
      - **Examples:** 
         1. In "The Leftovers" by Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta, 2% of the global population suddenly vanishes, making protagonists Kevin Garvey and Nora Durst question the meaning of life.
         2. In the play "Machinal" by Sophie Treadwell, Helen marries a man out of social pressure, despite her disdain for him.
         3. In "Fight Club" by Chuck Palahniuk, the main character meets Tyler Durden, and together they start a fight club.
         4. In the film "Mrs. Soffel" by Ron Nyswaner, Kate Soffel, a warden's wife, decides to save a condemned prisoner.

In essence, the "Preparation" step in character design focuses on setting up a character with potential and unexplored depth. The inciting incident, an event that catalyzes the story, should align with the character's underlying need, pushing them towards experiences that will help them realize their fullest self.
### 2. Revelation
**Summary and Clarification:**

**2. Revelation Principle:** 

- **Principle:** Events within a story's progression unveil a character's genuine nature, often in contrast to their external characterization. While a character's fundamental essence may not necessarily change, the reader's or audience's perception and understanding of the character deepens.

    - **Character Arcs and Deep Change:** Most stories reveal a character's true nature without necessarily altering the character's foundational essence. Some genres, including Action/Adventure, War, Horror, Fantasy, and Crime, dive deep into the hidden nature of a character, uncovering their core psyche without necessarily inducing profound change in them.

    - **Revealing through High-Stake Choices:** Key moments in a story, especially those that present high-stake choices, often peel back layers of a character, exposing their innermost self. For example, a decision between two equally devastating outcomes can lay bare the character's true nature.

       - **Examples:** 
          1. In "The Beauty Queen of Leenane" by Martin McDonagh, Maureen Folan's act of murdering her mother uncovers her schizophrenic nature, revealing her true perception of herself as being her mother all along.
          2. In "The Catcher in the Rye" by J. D. Salinger, the protagonist Holden Caulfield's loneliness and struggles with sexuality and romance are consistent throughout, showing his feelings of alienation without a major shift in his core self.
          3. In "Annie Hall" by Woody Allen, Alvy Singer's life choices slowly expose his deep-rooted neuroses hidden beneath a layer of humor and charisma.

- **In Summary:** A character's external circumstances change over a story, and through their choices, their genuine nature becomes apparent. While the character themselves might remain consistent, the audience's understanding evolves, delving deeper into the character's true essence. To gauge this principle's effectiveness in a narrative, one can ask: How is the character perceived at the beginning vs. the end? This should highlight a shift in audience insight rather than character change.
### 3. Change
**Summary and Clarification:**

The text delves into the concept of character development and identity in storytelling by referencing the Ship of Theseus Paradox. The central question posed by this paradox is if an object (or a person, in the case of the metaphor) undergoes numerous changes over time, does it retain its original identity?

1. **Ship of Theseus Paradox**: 
   - If every part of a ship is replaced over time, is it still the same ship? 
   - If a ship is replicated exactly, is it the same as the original?
   - This analogy applies to the idea of identity: Who are we? Do we change over time or stay fundamentally the same?
   
2. **Change Principle**: 
   - Some authors believe characters retain their core identity despite changes.
   - Others believe significant events or time can drastically change a character's core identity.
   
3. **Theory of Perpetual Identity**: 
   - Argues that a person starts as a blank slate but over time gains a unique pattern of behaviors. 
   - This pattern forms a stable core identity, and while outer circumstances may change, this core remains consistent. 
   - E.g., A person may undergo personal or career changes, but their essence remains unchanged.

4. **Theory of the Changing Identity**: 
   - Humans analyze their instincts, seeking to improve or alter themselves. 
   - Some writers believe characters can and should evolve. 
   - When change happens, it usually aligns with a character's defining dimension, either positive or negative.
   
5. **Positive vs. Negative Character Arcs**: 
   - A positive arc sees a character overcome flaws or challenges, ending in personal growth.
   - A negative arc might see a character succumb to their flaws, leading to their downfall.
   
6. **Change from a Character's Point of View (POV)**: 
   - How characters view themselves over time varies. Some see growth, while others feel alienated from their past selves.
   - Characters might react differently to change: feeling it's temporary, thinking they've become better, longing for their past self, or discovering their true self.
   
7. **Change from an Author’s POV**: 
   - Authors have personal beliefs about character change. 
   - Some believe in a fixed identity, others believe in transformation. 
   - The connection between a character's past and present shapes their identity journey. Traumatic pasts can fragment identity, while healthy ones strengthen it.

In essence, understanding character development and change is vital for writers as it drives the narrative and influences readers' connection to the story.
### 4. Completion 
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Completion Principle:** This principle posits that the finest stories fulfill the protagonist's dual elements of need and desire to the utmost boundaries of human experience.

1. **Desire vs. Need:** 
   - **Desire** refers to a character’s ongoing ambition or an unmet goal. As a story progresses, the protagonist constantly chases this desire to the furthest reaches of their emotional and mental capacities.
   - **Need** reflects an inner void or potential within a character that yearns for fulfillment. At the story's beginning, a character appears incomplete, having not experienced situations that bring out their utmost abilities. The story's climax pushes them to their limits, leading them to evolve and become a complete character with no room left for change or revelation.

2. **Character Awareness:** Characters are often oblivious to their needs. Only the story's creator truly understands the character's latent potential and envisions the character's most complete state. Characters that don't change, such as action heroes or comic figures, possess no such "need". They remain captivating despite their static nature. For instance, Larry David in "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and superheroes in Marvel films retain their core characteristics across episodes or sequels.

3. **Character-driven Stories:** In narratives focused on character development, the central characters begin as incomplete beings. Their prior experiences haven't challenged their maximum potential. Yet, as the story progresses, they face trials that push them to their limits, culminating in a climax where they fulfill their intrinsic human needs.

4. **Examples of Completed Characters:**
   - **Medea** in Euripides's play: Reacting to betrayal, Medea takes extreme actions, revealing her character's full depth.
   - **Oedipus** in Sophocles's "Oedipus Rex": Initially, Oedipus is overwhelmed by the truth of his actions. Yet, in "Oedipus at Colonus," he confronts his pride and lack of self-awareness, achieving completion.
   - The monk in **Kim Ki-duk’s "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"**: The monk undergoes significant transformation, culminating in wisdom and self-completion.
   - Charles Arrowby in **"The Sea, The Sea"** by Iris Murdoch: Obsessed with romance, Charles eventually confronts his self-obsession and limited understanding of himself.
   - Howar d Beale in **"Network"**: He exposes all dimensions of his character as he confronts the absurdity of modern life.
   - Michael Corleone's completion is debated across **"The Godfather"** series.
   - Nora and Kevin in **"The Leftovers"**: Their love story completes as they come to terms with their love and its role in making sense of the inexplicable.

The Completion Principle emphasizes the duality of desire and need in character development, with profound storytelling pushing characters to the limits of their humanity.
## COMPLETING A CHARACTER
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Character Completion Principle Revisited:** 

Characters in literature are driven by various internal forces, be it a strong desire to leave a mark in the world, a profound need to find purpose, or an innate curiosity about their own essence. The underlying theme is that these characters seek completion. 

1. **Inner Construction Through Outward Testing:** Characters often seek to understand themselves by facing challenges in the external world. They chase something they deeply value but cannot entirely predict or control. This chase often culminates in their self-realization or completion.

2. **Writer’s Role in Character’s Journey:** Most characters don't introspect on their depths or potentials. It's the writer who probes and pushes them. The author acknowledges that every individual has an immense depth of thoughts and emotions, much of which remains untouched through life. A writer should gauge the character right before the story starts and determine what they lack. This understanding helps to craft the events in the story that lead the character toward self-completion.

   - **Questions for Crafting a Character’s Journey:** 
     - What is the character lacking in their humanity at the story’s start?
     - What event would set them on the path to fulfilling their potential? This becomes the inciting incident.
     - What experiences will push the character to the brink of their emotional and intellectual capacities? These form the subsequent events of the story.

3. **Reflections upon Completion:** Once characters reach a state of completion, they often ponder on the ironies and experiences that shaped them. This reflection is seen in various literary works:
   - **Macbeth** in "The Tragedy of Macbeth" contemplates the relentless passage of time.
   - **Lily** in Virginia Woolf’s "To the Lighthouse" finds fulfillment in her artistic vision.
   - **Jack Burden** in Robert Penn Warren’s "All the King’s Men" reflects on the weight of history and time.
   - **Humbert Humbert** in Vladimir Nabokov’s "Lolita" speaks of the shared immortality between him and Lolita through art.
   - **Salieri** in Peter Shaffer’s play "Amadeus" absolves mediocrity.
   - **Elaine** in Margaret Atwood’s "Cat’s Eye" reflects on the limited but sufficient light of the past.
   - **Rick Blaine** in "Casablanca" mentions destiny's role in shaping events.

In essence, a character’s journey toward completion involves both internal introspection and external challenges, with the writer orchestrating this path by understanding and pushing the character’s limits. Once completed, characters often reflect on the experiences and ironies that have defined their journey.

# 12 THE SYMBOLIC CHARACTER
**Summary & Clarification:**

All characters, irrespective of their depth or simplicity, represent more than their literal selves in literature. Each one can be viewed as a metaphor representing either a societal role or an internal moral compass, or sometimes both. This dichotomy categorizes narratives into two broad spectrums: **Realism** and **Symbolism**.

1. **Realism vs. Symbolism in Storytelling**:
   - **Realism:** Characters are formed from daily observations and revolve around real-life issues like family, relationships, legal systems, and moral dilemmas. Here, the tangible character overshadows any symbolic significance.
   - **Symbolism:** This is especially seen in Speculative Fiction genres like Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Superhero tales, where characters become larger-than-life symbols. For instance, Marvel and DC superheroes often represent ideals or values.

2. **The Emergence of Symbols**:
   - Symbols aren't intentionally created but emerge organically during the writing process. An author can't conjure a completely new symbol; they tap into existing, timeless symbols.
   - The process starts when humans perceive objects and instinctively search for deeper meanings or associations. Over time, these associations become abstract symbols. For example:
     - The geometric circle, inspired by natural curves, symbolizes the Cycle of Life.
     - The pregnant woman embodies the power of life, leading to the symbol of the Earth Mother.
     - Ocean's turbulence reminds people of an enraged father, culminating in the Greek god Poseidon.

3. **Symbolism, Dreams, and Evolution**:
   - Dreaming in symbols is believed to be an evolutionary mechanism for our ancestors to protect sleep. Our restless minds are constantly chattering, which can hinder sleep. However, the brain uses dreams to compress these myriad thoughts into symbols, providing a restful reprieve.
   - Just as pistons concentrate heat by reducing volume, symbols derive power by compressing many meanings into one image. For instance, a bearded figure seated on a throne symbolizes the Father, encompassing myriad concepts like wisdom, judgment, authority, fear, gratitude, and reverence.

In conclusion, characters in literature serve dual roles: their literal, personal selves and the broader metaphoric identities they represent. This duality navigates between realism and symbolism, with symbols organically rising from innate human perceptions and associations, often mirrored in our dreams.
## SYMBOLIC CHARACTER SPECTRUM
**Summary and Clarification**:

**1. Symbolism in Character Creation:**
- **Spectrum of Symbolism**: 
   - **Archetypes**: Brightest symbols; universal characters that maintain core attributes across cultures.
   - **Allegories**: Glowing symbols; represent a particular value or facet.
   - **Types**: Muted symbols; based on specific behaviors.
   - **Stock Characters**: Dimmest symbols; defined by their job or profession.

**2. Principles of Character Creation:**

   - **Archetypes**: Turn essences into characters. They are universal symbols that are deeply rooted in human culture. While their external details might change based on cultural contexts, their foundational characteristics remain consistent. For instance, the Earth Mother is always nurturing, without any contradictory traits. However, the ideal nature of archetypes means characters based on them can often seem one-dimensional.
   
   - **Allegories**: Turn values into characters. Unlike archetypes, which encapsulate the entirety of a role, allegorical characters represent just one aspect or value. For instance, in the novel "Lord of the Flies," each character symbolizes a particular value, like democracy or savagery. These characters serve as a reflection of broader concepts within the narrative world.
   
   - **Types**: Turn behavior into characters. These characters are often based on single, defining adjectives, like "jealous" or "shy." They represent particular behaviors or temperaments. For example, Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" showcases dwarfs named after their most defining traits, such as Sleepy or Happy. Types can also be based on positive or negative adjectives, allowing for a wide range of character possibilities.
   
   - **Stocks**: Turn a job into a character. Stock characters are identified primarily by their professions, which is their main characteristic. These characters provide instant recognition and understanding to an audience. However, to make these characters memorable, they need unique traits or quirks that set them apart.

**Clarification**: 

This text provides an in-depth look at the varying degrees of symbolic representation in character creation, from universal symbols (archetypes) to job-specific ones (stocks). Archetypes like the "Hero" or the "Mentor" are universal and recognized across cultures, while allegorical characters, like those in "Lord of the Flies," represent specific values. On the other hand, types are characterized by specific behaviors or adjectives, and stocks are defined by their professions. For a character to resonate deeply with readers or viewers, it's crucial to subtly weave the symbolic nature into their characterization.
## REALISTIC VERSUS SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Realism vs. Symbolism in Character Creation**

**Realism**:
- Origin: Has its roots in ancient texts like Homer's Iliad which captured the real-life experiences of warriors.
- Focus: Highlights life's true experiences without sugarcoating or filtering them through a lens of idealism.
- Characteristics:
  1. **Truth**: Realism is grounded in facts, presenting a world where wishes rarely come true.
  2. **True Character**: Realistic characters possess intricate psychologies as opposed to just having striking personalities.
  3. **Level of Conflict**: Emphasizes inner conflicts, such as self-doubt and personal dilemmas.
  4. **Complexity**: Realistic characters have multiple layers, including public, personal, and hidden selves.
  5. **Detail**: Rich in details which specify and enhance character depth.
  6. **Comprehension**: Requires effort to understand due to complex and intricate character dynamics.
  7. **Worldview**: Presents a skeptical perspective, often showing characters in challenging, non-idealized situations.
  8. **Endings**: Focuses on the irony of life and its dualities.
  9. **Character Dynamics**: Reveals hidden truths in characters and shows their evolving nature.
  10. **Social Dynamics**: Portrays fluid power dynamics irrespective of societal structure.

**Symbolism**:
- Origin: Traces back to prehistoric myths where nature's forces were given human-like characteristics.
- Focus: Characters and events in these tales are symbolic, not literary, implying that their actions carry more weight than their words.
- Characteristics:
  1. **Truth**: Symbolic genres like myths and fantasies show a world where wishes are fulfilled.
  2. **True Character**: Symbolic characters are marked by strong personalities over deep psychology.
  3. **Level of Conflict**: Emphasizes external conflicts against antagonistic forces.
  4. **Complexity**: Characters are often one-dimensional, based on archetypes.
  5. **Detail**: Focuses on the essential, avoiding intricate character traits.
  6. **Comprehension**: Characters are typically easy to understand and predictable.
  7. **Worldview**: Often leans towards sentimentality, making characters and situations seem sweeter than reality.
  8. **Endings**: Typically simple, devoid of the complexities of real-life.
  9. **Character Dynamics**: Symbolic characters remain rigid, with no evolution throughout the story.
  10. **Social Dynamics**: Generally portrays a rigid class system.

In essence, while realism dives deep into the intricate nuances and challenges of life, symbolism operates on a broader scale, portraying characters and events as representations of larger concepts or ideals.
## CASE STUDY: GAME OF THRONES
**Summary & Clarification:**

David Benioff and D. B. Weiss adapted George R. R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" into a television series, infusing a high fantasy tale with stark realism. This adaptation stands out because it doesn't just offer a clear-cut symbolic representation of characters but paints them with varying shades of moral ambiguity.

In the vast ensemble of characters:
- **Cersei of House Lannister**: Represents the far right on the political spectrum. She is depicted as a regressive and incestuous monarch, favoring feudalism and resistant to change. In essence, she is a living embodiment of symbolic myths.
  
- **Daenerys of House Targaryen**: Sits on the opposite, progressive left end. She is a beacon of hope, justice, and progress, advocating for change and opposing feudalism. Unlike Cersei, Daenerys challenges and denies the typical myths of her world.

The narrative also introduces various social structures and groups:
- **Night's Watch**: Symbolizes meritocracy, where status is earned.
- **The Unsullied**: Represents equality, as they are a unified army of freed slaves.
- **The Sparrows**: Showcase religious fanaticism.
- **Councils**: Represent democratic decision-making processes where members vote.

However, with the emergence of the Night King and his army of White Walkers, the central conflict shifts. Instead of the balance between realism and symbolism or the political intricacies, the story narrows down to the primal fight for survival: life vs. death.
## HOW TO MAKE THE OLD NEW
**Summary & Clarification:**

To create memorable and unique characters in a literary landscape filled with age-old archetypes and stereotypes, writers should blend familiarity with innovation. Although every character might be rooted in familiar types, making them stand out is essential. Here are four strategies for achieving this:

1. **Speculative Fiction Approach**: Craft characters that have believable motivations, even if their actions seem outlandish or fantastic. Basically, make their reasons relatable even if their actions aren't.
  
2. **Realism Approach**: Develop characters that have unconventional perspectives or lead unconventional lives. These characters see the world in a unique, skewed way, different from the norm.

3. **Radical Experiences**: Regardless of the genre, subject your characters to transformative events that challenge and alter their existing beliefs. Such experiences can lead to profound changes in their worldviews.

4. **Sense of Immediacy**: Make readers or viewers feel close to the characters. In written prose, this can be achieved by using a character's point of view to recount past events. In visual media, present events as if the character is experiencing them in real-time.

In essence, while you can't escape the influence of traditional character molds, you can infuse them with originality by employing these strategies.

# 13 THE RADICAL CHARACTER
**The Realism/Nonrealism/Radicalism Triangle**
**Summary & Clarification:**

In the realm of fiction, there are three primary approaches to character development, forming a triangle of possibilities:

1. **Realism**: Characters are grounded in reality, possessing abilities and qualities typical of ordinary people.
2. **Nonrealism**: Characters have abilities or qualities that exceed the ordinary, often delving into the fantastical or supernatural.
3. **Radicalism**: Characters exhibit distorted or exaggerated powers, combining elements from both realism and nonrealism.

These approaches can intersect and merge, allowing for a limitless range of character types within this triangular framework.
## REALISM: CONVENTIONAL CHARACTERS IN CONVENTIONAL WORLDS
**Summary & Clarification:**

The Realism literary movement emerged about 200 years ago, opposing the dramatic flair of Romanticism. Despite its attempt to depict authentic life, Realism is still a crafted and stylized representation of reality. Realist authors closely observe real-life behaviors, process them through their creative lens, and then produce characters that mirror our world. These characters possess a coherent identity, moral grounding, realistic understanding of their surroundings, and the ability to interact, make decisions, pursue goals, and evolve. They're set in narratives that audiences recognize as reflecting the common human experience, making them familiar to readers and viewers.
## NONREALISM: CONVENTIONAL CHARACTERS IN UNCONVENTIONAL WORLDS
**Summary & Clarification:**

Nonrealism is a literary approach that situates conventional characters from Realism within extraordinary or fantastical settings. These settings might involve supernatural elements (like in "Pirates of the Caribbean"), magic (as in "Harry Potter"), dreamscapes ("Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"), or futuristic science ("Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"). Nonrealist stories might also break the fourth wall, allowing characters to communicate directly with audiences, as seen in shows like "Fleabag."

Though these worlds are derived from daydreams or night dreams and act as metaphors for idealized realities, they have two commonalities with Realism: 
1. Every fictional world, no matter how unusual, has its set of rules or causality, dictating what can or cannot happen.
2. Characters within these worlds believe in their reality. Even if they initially question their surroundings, they eventually accept them and act accordingly. An example is Phil Connors in "Groundhog Day."

Both Realism and Nonrealism focus on characters that are multi-dimensional and relatable, with motivations that are credible. Their stories convey clear meanings with emotional resonance, and the dialogues aim for instant clarity. These characters populate popular works across various media. Writers should be aware of their target audience's preference, as they typically lean towards either Realism or Nonrealism, with a general aversion to Radicalism.
## RADICALISM: UNCONVENTIONAL CHARACTERS IN UNCONVENTIONAL WORLDS
**Summary & Clarification:**

Radicalism in literature emerged as a response to increasing doubts about the meaning and purpose of life, especially post the two world wars and numerous genocides. This doubt was intensified by 19th-century philosophers like Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, who flagged the rising sense of meaninglessness, and by psychoanalysts like Freud and Jung, who suggested that truly understanding oneself is nearly impossible.

In response to this existential crisis, Radicalism in literature turned storytelling on its head:
- Instead of continuity, it brought fragmentation.
- Instead of clarity, there was distortion.
- Emotions took a backseat to intellectual engagement.
- There was a marked move from involvement to detachment and from progression to repetition.

Radicalism is a deliberate move away from convention, yet it is paradoxically tied to the very orthodoxy it opposes. In terms of literature, Radicalism can be likened to Cubism in art, where a character (or a portrait) is distorted yet recognizable. The settings in radical works are symbolic but lack consistent rules. For instance, in Jean-Luc Godard’s "Weekend", random events occur without reason, while in Samuel Beckett’s "Waiting for Godot", nothing happens, also without reason.

Characters in radical works often lack connections to external entities like god, society, or family. Their dialogues can seem nonsensical, and their settings are usually symbolic but unpredictable. These characters can be extremely isolated or frenzied and chaotic. In prose, Radicalism is easier to depict, allowing writers to delve deep into a character's fractured psyche, showcasing their fragmented desires and splintered thoughts, as seen in works by Samuel Beckett and Don DeLillo. However, portraying radical characters in plays or films is more challenging due to the concrete presence of an actor, which adds a semblance of solidity. Playwrights and filmmakers must then find creative ways to express fragmentation and distortion, as seen in Beckett’s "Happy Days" or Leo Carax's "Holy Motors".
## CREATING A RADICAL CHARACTER
**Summary & Clarification:**

To create a radical character, one needs to deviate from the conventional traits often seen in literature. Here are the strategies:

1. **Subtract Self-Awareness**: Instead of characters who are aware of their actions and consequences, make them comic obsessives, single-mindedly fixated on a particular idea or trait. For instance, in the movie "A Fish Called Wanda", Archie Leach constantly fears embarrassment, but ends up in humiliating situations. For radical characters, this obsession becomes their entire identity, like in "The Maids" where characters are trapped in sadomasochistic games.

2. **Subtract Depth**: This means creating characters who lack depth and inner complexity. In "Falling Down", William Foster’s sanity progressively diminishes. These characters, as they lose depth, become closer to the radical, their humanity shrinking, and their lives verging on the absurd.

3. **Subtract Change**: While complex characters often undergo significant changes or arcs throughout a story, flat characters remain static. In genres of Realism, characters like Jude and Tess from Thomas Hardy's novels start hopeful and decline into hopelessness. In non-Realism genres, characters represent either good or evil, and they remain that way. For radical characters, any significant shift from their static nature would be incongruous. For example, if characters in "Waiting for Godot" decided to change their aimless lives, the play's existential essence would be lost. Similarly, in Will Self’s trilogy, if fragmented characters were made whole, it would undermine the unique narrative.
   
4. **Subtract Identity**: Prior to the 20th century, authors built character identity based on cultural attributes such as gender, class, and religion. However, with Modernism, the focus shifted inward, emphasizing an individual's inner life. By the century's end, postmodernism suggested that both external and internal worlds could be hellish. Characters then grappled with issues like derealization and depersonalization, leading to a loss of self-identity. Examples from literature were cited to explain different ways characters can lose their identity, such as through the loss or rejection of an identity source, trauma, identity theft, obsession, and more.
   
5. **Subtract Purpose**: Some characters abandon external life for internal reflection, thinking it would bring self-awareness. However, they end up feeling lost and aimless. This can lead to purposelessness, as portrayed in various literary works, where characters are stuck in repetitive or absurd situations. 
   
6. **Subtract Unity**: While complex characters possess dualities, radical roles can fragment, as seen in participatory theatre where performers and characters merge and diverge. Modern novels also show objects turning into characters and multiplying.
   
7. **Subtract Maturity**: A mature mind balances external realities with internal instincts. Radical characters often act like children, being either too obedient or too impulsive. Examples from literature and theatre demonstrate this perpetual state of childhood.
   
8. **Subtract Conscience**: While traditionally evil characters may have a purpose for their cruelty, radically evil ones seek pleasure in cruelty for its own sake. The distinction is made between characters that are merely power-seeking versus those who are sadistically evil.
   
9. **Subtract Belief**: A character's sanity can be defined in relation to the world around them. Radical characters find themselves in a world that makes no sense and thus, they possess no belief system. Unlike conventional characters who trust in a structured reality, radical characters despair in the face of the absurd.

**In Short:** The discussed points explore how characters in modern and postmodern literature have evolved. They often lack traditional elements like identity, purpose, unity, maturity, conscience, and belief. This absence leads them to experience fragmentation, purposelessness, childishness, sadistic evil, and existential despair.

## THE FUTURE: UNCONVENTIONAL CHARACTERS IN CONVENTIONAL WORLDS
**Summary and Clarification**:

The modern era of storytelling has evolved from its previous postmodern phase, which is now viewed as outdated and overly repeated. The trend now is not to mimic past storytelling styles but to critique and lampoon current societal aspects. This modern storytelling contrasts classical satirical works like Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's Travels" where rational narrators mocked absurd societies. The contemporary approach, instead, places eccentric characters in traditional settings to evoke empathy from audiences, a shift pioneered by playwrights like Samuel Beckett.

Current novels, films, and TV series feature protagonists with moral ambiguities or extreme personalities, challenging the boundaries of audience empathy. Examples include dark comedies and drama series that showcase characters with significant flaws, such as "The White Tiger", "Birdman", "Mr. Robot", "Santa Clarita Diet", "Killing Eve", and "Better Call Saul". These characters can be criminals, mentally unstable, or even outright psychotic, yet they're presented in ways that encourage viewers to relate and connect with them.

In essence, modern writers are testing the boundaries of characterization, urging audiences to understand and even sympathize with increasingly complex and morally gray characters. The boundaries of what's considered too dark or edgy are continually being stretched in today's narrative art.

# 14 CHARACTER IN GENRE
**Summary and Clarification**:

Storytelling in art isn't bound by strict rules but is guided by familiar patterns or conventions known as genres. These genres provide audiences with certain expectations based on the genre's traditional designs. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

1. **Genres & Expectations**:
   - **Crime Story**: Involves a crime's commission and discovery, a protagonist's attempt to seek justice, and a resolution that may or may not restore justice.
   - **Love Story**: Chronicles the meeting and falling in love of two characters, their struggle against challenges to their relationship, and a conclusion where love either triumphs or fails.
   - **Education Plot**: Describes a protagonist's journey from a sense of emptiness to finding meaning and purpose, typically with the help of a guiding figure.

2. **Genre Evolution**: As societal beliefs and norms change, genres adapt, often innovating to reflect these shifts. Writers play a crucial role by either adhering to, modifying, or completely reinventing genre conventions. Regardless, these changes need to meet audience expectations. Changing a genre convention should enhance the story's meaning and emotion.

3. **Importance of Conventions**: Genre conventions aren't restrictions but rather enablers. For instance, a Love Story can't unfold if the lovers don't meet, and a Crime Story is moot if a crime isn't identified. Without these conventions, storytelling wouldn't have a foundation.

4. **Genre Classes**:
   - **Primary Genres**: These deal with content creation, shaping characters, events, values, and emotions.
   - **Presentational Genres**: These focus on how content is conveyed, such as whether a story is comedic or dramatic, realistic or fantastical.

In essence, genres offer a structured blueprint for storytelling, but they're not rigid barriers. They evolve with time and societal changes, with the storyteller navigating and adapting these conventions to best serve their narrative.
## THE ORIGIN OF PRIMARY GENRES
**Summary and Clarification**:

Storytelling genres evolved based on life's varying conflict levels: Physical, Social, Personal, and Private. Here's a distilled version of the provided information:

        - **Love Story**: A genre highlighting romantic love, which arose as a response to civilize male rage. It has seen tides of Romanticism and anti-Romanticism. The Buddy Story, focusing on friendship, is a subgenre.

    - **Self Versus Self**:
        - Explores deep psychological intricacies of characters, highlighting the evolution or devolution in morality, mentality, and humanity. 
            - **Morality**: Evaluates a character's treatment of others, either depicting them as more kind or cruel.
            - **Mentality**: Probes a character’s existential contemplation of their life's meaning.
            - **Humanity**: Delves into the potential change in a character's core essence, questioning whether they evolve or regress.

2. **Character Arc Execution**:
    - To effectively showcase a character's internal journey, writers must understand the depth and breadth of their character's nature. By placing the character under pressure and making them face choices, the character's evolution or regression is revealed.

In essence, storytelling genres arose from different fundamental conflicts that individuals face, from battling nature and societal norms to navigating intimate relationships and grappling with inner struggles.
## THE SIXTEEN PRIMARY GENRES

### The Ten Plots of Fortune
Primary genres are responsible for vital changes in a character's life, either external or internal. These are divided into two main categories: Plots of Fortune and Plots of Character. All primary genres have four main elements: core value, core event, core emotion, and core cast.

**Plots of Fortune:**
This type of plot brings about external changes in a character’s life. Here are the ten genres that fall under Plots of Fortune:

1. **Action Genre**
   - **Core Value:** Life vs. Death

   - **Brief:** Focuses on ambitious individuals striving for achievement, often found in autobiographies.

Each genre brings forth a different facet of human experience, emphasizing unique core values and events that determine the course of the story.

### The Six Plots of Character 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Character Change in Plots:**
Plots involving character changes delve into the transformation of a character's morality, mentality, or humanity. Such plots are classified into two main categories:

1. **Static Characters:** These are stock characters with unchanging nature. They are straightforward, fulfilling their roles without personal evolution.
2. **Dynamic Characters:** These characters have hidden depths and, through their decisions, reveal but don’t necessarily change their true nature. They are multi-faceted and can undergo psychological change, depending on the story's requirements.

The plot genres are divided into three main categories based on which aspect of the character they target for transformation:

**1. Morality Plots:**
   - Focus on a character's moral compass and how they treat others.
   - These plots are influenced by societal norms, laws, and individual principles.
   - **Redemption Plot:** This arc sees the protagonist's morality change from negative to positive. For example, a character might move from being deceitful to being honest.
   - **Degeneration Plot:** The protagonist's morality shifts from positive to negative. They may start out as ethical but eventually become corrupted.

**2. Mentality Plots:**
   - Revolve around a character’s mindset, attitudes, and worldview.
   - **Education Plot:** Protagonists start by seeing life as meaningless and, through learning or experiences, find purpose. It’s about a character's journey from ignorance to enlightenment.
   - **Disillusionment Plot:** Protagonists begin optimistic and slowly become pessimistic as they face the harsh realities of life. They lose their belief in the meaningfulness of life.

**3. Humanity Plots:**
   - Target the entirety of a character’s being, considering their maturity, spirituality, wisdom, and more.
   - **Evolution Plot:** A character grows, evolves, and maximizes their potential. Often seen in coming-of-age stories where the protagonist moves from immaturity to maturity.
   - **Devolution Plot:** The protagonist deteriorates or loses their essence over time. A common theme here is addiction or a series of events leading to the degradation of their humanity.

**In essence**, character change plots dissect the transformation journey of characters across dimensions of morality, mentality, and humanity. Each plot type provides a distinct framework for showcasing either the ascent or descent of a character's internal landscape.
## THE TEN PRESENTATIONAL GENRES
**Summary and Clarification:**

Storytellers have crafted various techniques to bring out the essence and vibrancy of primary genres. These techniques revolve around how the story is presented or the medium in which it's expressed. Consequently, ten presentational genres have emerged:

1. **Comedy**: While any main genre can be humorous, dramas can especially turn comedic, with some becoming farcical.
   
2. **Musical**: Essentially, any story can be told through song and dance.
   
3. **Science Fiction**: Stories from any genre can be placed in a setting that's either futuristic or depicts an alternative reality.
   
4. **History**: Narratives of any kind can be set in the past.
   
5. **Fantasy**: Any story can be set in a world that's either magical or outside the bounds of time.
   
6. **Documentary**: Any genre can be presented in a factual manner, akin to a documentary.
   
7. **Animation**: Stories from any genre can be turned into animated content.
   
8. **Autobiography**: Any story can center around the lead character of a memoir.
   
9. **Biography**: Stories can focus on the external life of a real individual. The depth to which their internal life is explored is up to the writer. Examples include "Libra" by Don DeLillo, which delves into Lee Harvey Oswald, and "Blonde" by Joyce Carol Oates, a fictional portrayal of Marilyn Monroe.
   
10. **High Art**: This genre is characteristic of experimental forms of storytelling seen in art films, avant-garde theater, and cutting-edge fiction. These stories start with a base genre but then distort it by using fragmented plots, unreliable narrators, and inconsistent timelines. They also tend to incorporate varied mediums, powerful imagery, and iconic symbols.

In essence, these presentational genres highlight that any core story can be conveyed in a multitude of ways, depending on the medium or style chosen by the storyteller.
## GENRE COMBINATIONS
**Summary and Clarification:**

Combining central plots and subplots from different genres leads to richer character depth. When mixed, separate storylines from different genres intersect, adding layers of meaning and character depth. David Mitchell's "Cloud Atlas" is an example where six storylines from different genres interlace. These stories, across various timeframes and settings, revolve around reincarnated characters symbolizing the theme of predation in different forms. Mixing genres requires mastering more conventions, and the resulting complex narrative can be challenging to track for readers.

On the other hand, merged genres involve a storyline from one genre unfolding within another, adding motivation and intricacies. For instance, in "Love After Love" by Russell Harbaugh, the main theme is a Domestic Drama (how a family copes after the father's death). This overarching story is influenced by inner stories: a Love Story for the widow and two Evolution Plots for her sons. The resolution of these inner stories drives the primary plot's climax.

Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood" uses both methods. It merges a Buddy Plot (between Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth) with an Evolution Plot (Dalton's personal growth). The tension arises from whether Dalton can overcome his reliance on Booth and his alcoholism. Simultaneously, a Crime Story involving the Manson gang intersects these merged stories, culminating in a dramatic climax.

Merging genres intertwines story outcomes and typically streamlines the narrative by reducing the number of primary characters and conventions. For example, a single event can set the stage for two genres, such as lovers meeting amidst a bank heist.



# 15 CHARACTER IN ACTION
**Summary**:

Every character has a personal narrative formed by their past, present, and future perspectives. This self-story is a blend of their past experiences, their current state, and their aspirations. The future aspect is crucial because it sets the direction for their actions. Stemming from their upbringing and experiences, this self-story dictates the character's modus operandi (MO) or their unique approach to situations. The MO is more than just personality traits; it's a combination of strategies they use to achieve their desires or escape fears. While some characters might change their MO due to life circumstances, most modify it based on factors like family, career, and love. When a plot point disrupts a character's equilibrium, they respond based on their MO, aiming to restore balance. To truly bring a character to life, one must understand their self-story and see the world through their future aspirations. Characters often have MOs that fall into common themes, with examples from various media that can be further twisted to add depth and drive the narrative.
## HOLLYWOOD THEMES
**Summary**:

People often model their real-life behaviors or modus operandi (MOs) after fictional characters from movies or books. These behaviors then make their way back into literature, creating a loop between reality and fiction. Here are five prevalent MOs:

1. **The Mystery Lover**: The character seeks a mysterious lover due to the monotony of everyday life. *Example*: Scottie Ferguson in "Vertigo". *Twist*: The mysterious person is actually ordinary and just pretends to be enigmatic.

2. **The Alien Adventurer**: Feeling alienated from society, the character portrays a bizarre version of themselves and seeks equally or more strange companions. *Example*: Cosmo Kramer in "Seinfeld". *Twist*: What seems eccentric might just be a shallow attempt to appear intriguing.

3. **The Fairy Tale**: The character enacts a fairy-tale persona, like a prince or princess. *Example*: Buttercup in "The Princess Bride". *Twist*: The fairy-tale turns nightmarish with roles like prince and princess becoming corrupted.

4. **The Documentary**: Intellectuals analyze their relationships to the extent they become like scientific observations, reducing romance to an empirical study. *Example*: Alvy Singer in "Annie Hall". *Twist*: Over-analysis makes romance resemble a clinical study, which becomes a unique fetish.

5. **The XXX-Rated Flick**: Some characters indulge in sadomasochistic behaviors for the pleasure derived from cruelty or humiliation. *Example*: Lorne Malvo in "Fargo". *Twist*: The sadist's initial pleasure from degrading others diminishes over time, leading to self-inflicted violence due to an overwhelming fear of death.
## POLITICAL THEMES
**Summary**:

Politics pertains to the distribution of power in any social structure, whether it's in governments, institutions, or personal relationships. There's always an imbalance in power dynamics, leading to various modus operandi (MOs) in characters:

1. **Tyranny**: The character exercises oppressive power over others. 
   *Example*: Tony Soprano in "The Sopranos".
   *Twist*: The oppressed revolts and takes over, only to desire their old position because of newfound stresses. A second twist sees the previous tyrant enjoying a carefree life.

2. **Democracy**: The character believes in and promotes a balanced distribution of power.
   *Example*: Jon Snow in "Game of Thrones".
   *Twist*: A compassionate and balanced leader is perceived as weak by their family, leading to infidelity and unruliness as they yearn for a stricter hand.

3. **Anarchy**: The character's impulsive use of power results in personal and societal chaos.
   *Example*: Larry David in "Curb Your Enthusiasm".
   *Twist*: A chaotic individual adopts a rational approach to life, only to find the predictability boring and realizes they prefer the thrill of disorder.

In essence, politics and power dynamics can influence character MOs in various ways, leading to intriguing narratives and unexpected twists in stories.
## OBJECT THEMES
**Summary**:

Characters who struggle with forming genuine intimate relationships often treat people as utilities or objects. Here are four typical modus operandi (MOs) for such characters:

1. **The Collector**: They accumulate prized possessions, including people, for their beauty or value.
   *Example*: Frederick in "The Collector" by John Fowles.
   *Twist*: The one who collects becomes the one being collected.

2. **The Player**: They view life as a game and use others as pawns, either knowingly or unknowingly.
   *Example*: Frank Underwood in "House of Cards".
   *Twist*: The manipulator ends up being manipulated.

3. **The Obsessive**: These characters fixate on one thing to the point of obsession, whether it's love, religion, drugs, or even themselves.
   *Example*: Dorian Gray in "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde.
   *Twist*: When they finally attain their obsession, they despise it.

4. **The Businessman**: They operate their businesses mechanically, treating individuals as mere components.
   *Example*: Professor Henry Higgins in "Pygmalion" by George Bernard Shaw.
   *Twist*: The business crashes and goes insolvent.

In a nutshell, characters who struggle with true intimacy often engage in behaviors where people are commodified or objectified, leading to intriguing plot developments and twists.
## SCENE CREATION: CHARACTER IN ACTION
**Summary**:

Characters in stories act based on their desires. Here’s a breakdown of how writers consider a character's action:

1. **Desire and Action**: A character’s actions stem from their immediate (scene-objective) and long-term (super-objective) desires. The immediate desire is about what they want in the scene, while the long-term is about an overarching goal.
  
2. **Starting Action**: Characters begin scenes using tactics and behaviors they're familiar with, based on their experiences. They have an innate sense of probability about how others might respond to their actions.

3. **Counteraction**: Instead of the desired response, a character's actions often meet unexpected, opposing reactions. These counteractions challenge the character's expectations, leading to turning points in the story.

4. **Surprises from Counteractions**: These unexpected outcomes can shock the protagonist, reshaping their understanding of their environment and leading to an emotional shift.

5. **Emotional Impact of Change**: Emotions arise from changes in the story's values. A positive shift leads to positive emotions and vice versa. Even internal shifts, like a growing paranoia, can deeply affect a character’s emotions.

6. **Future Actions**: The protagonist persists, tackling challenges and evolving through the narrative. As they face stronger opposition, they may have to change their strategies or even their core identity. This character development can lead to different genres of character transformation.

Lastly, the process of drafting scenes can lead writers to revisit and refine their character designs and the overall narrative. The relationship between action and reaction in scenes is pivotal for creating layered characters and compelling stories.


# 16 CHARACTER IN PERFORMACE
**Summary**:

Audiences and readers seek two primary things from a story's characters: discovery and recognition.

1. **Discovery**: Audiences are drawn to stories for the thrill of encountering new worlds and characters. Just as explorers venture into unknown terrains, readers delve into stories hoping to meet unique characters with distinctive behaviors. Through these characters, they learn about human nature and the consequences of desires and actions, echoing Aristotle's sentiment that learning without explicit instruction is a great pleasure.

2. **Recognition**: Beyond the novelty, readers and audiences yearn to see themselves in the story. They look for characters with whom they can empathize, recognizing some intrinsic aspect of their humanity. Empathy is crucial because it allows readers to connect deeply with a character, making them feel a part of the narrative rather than mere outsiders. This emotional bond permits readers to vicariously experience a vast range of emotions and situations beyond their everyday lives.

To understand how stories achieve this mix of discovery and recognition for readers and audiences, it's essential to explore the different roles characters can play in a narrative.
## SEVEN FUNCTIONS OF CHARACTER IN PERFORMANCE
**Summary**:

Characters in stories serve multiple essential functions to engage readers and audiences:

1. **Expand Intellectual Pleasure**: Characters, through their unique traits and unpredictable behaviors, add depth and intrigue to the story, enhancing readers' intellectual engagement.
 
2. **Develop Empathy**: It's vital for readers and audiences to relate to and feel for characters. Empathy fosters a deep connection, preventing indifference.

3. **Drive Suspense**: A character's nature combined with concerns for their fate piques emotional curiosity. Actions that are unpredictable, yet limited within a believable range, maintain suspense.

4. **Create a Layered Puzzle**: Characters add complexity to the narrative by posing questions about their psychology and motives. This adds an additional layer of suspense, complementing the primary plot-driven tension.

5. **Surprise**: Characters should react to unforeseen events in ways that, although initially surprising, make sense upon reflection, offering deeper insights into their personality.

6. **Illuminate Other Characters**: Characters in a narrative can highlight and deepen the aspects of other characters, adding depth to the ensemble.

7. **Inspire Insight into Human Nature**: Characters, whether grounded in reality or fantasy, prompt readers to introspect and better understand human behavior, including their own and that of those around them.
## THE READER/AUDIENCE/CHARACTER CONNECTION 
**Summary**:

Humans have evolved a range of emotions like fear, love, and hate to navigate threats, especially from other people. However, it's intriguing how we direct these emotions towards fictional characters, who don't exist in reality. While characters offer educational insights, helping us understand real people better, our deep emotional connection with them is perplexing. We might feel sorrow for real-life tragedies, but it's curious why we're also moved by fictional events and characters, like those in "The Towering Inferno". The question arises: How do fictional entities evoke genuine emotions in us?

**The Power of "As If" in the Mind:**  
Between our logical and emotional inner selves exists a third realm, where the mind can engage in pretend or hypothetical scenarios. This "as if" mode allows the mind to rehearse potential real-life scenarios, enhancing our evolutionary survival skills. Activities like dancing and storytelling have historically served as practice for real-life situations, allowing individuals to experience and prepare for emotions they might encounter in reality.

**Reader/Audience Relationship with Storytelling:**  
From a reader or viewer's perspective, the emotions they feel for fictional characters may seem straightforward. However, writers need to skillfully balance multiple elements:

1. **Life's Emotional Experiences:** Emotions fall into two categories: pleasurable (like joy and love) and painful (like grief and rage).
  
2. **Sympathy:** This pertains to the likability of a character. When readers or viewers find a character likable, they develop sympathetic feelings towards them.
  
3. **Empathy:** From the onset, readers or viewers seek to identify with characters, looking for relatable qualities. This identification allows them to immerse in the story, experiencing events and emotions as if they were happening to them.

4. **The Primacy of Empathy:** When engaging with stories, audiences often look for ethical behavior in characters. This is why their emotional reactions to stories often hinge on empathy. If they empathize with a protagonist, they are more likely to enjoy the narrative.

5. **Balancing Empathy and Storytelling Elements:** It's crucial for writers to strike various balances in their stories:
    - **Good:** Even in a world of negativity, a character's redeeming qualities can trigger audience empathy.
    - **Power:** The protagonist should feel like an underdog, facing significant odds.
    - **Intensity:** The depth of connection an audience feels towards a character depends on their ability to empathize.
    - **Focus:** While the main character should be the central focus, subplots with their protagonists can enhance the narrative.
    - **Attitudes:** Characters' reactions send cues to the audience about how they should feel.

6. **The Dangers of Empathy:** While empathy is natural, it can lead to bias and clouded judgment, favoring those we see as "like us." Without empathy, sympathy alone can come across as insincere.

7. **Sentiment vs. Sentimentality:** Sentiment is a genuine emotional reaction, while sentimentality is an exaggerated or unauthentic emotional display. A story's climax or pivotal moments should evoke genuine sentiment to resonate authentically with audiences.

8. **Reader/Audience Interpretation:** A compelling story should encourage readers or viewers to think beyond the immediate events, allowing them to draw connections and interpret the broader narrative.

In essence, the power of "as if" thinking has shaped human evolution, and the way readers or audiences relate to stories revolves around their capacity for sympathy and, more importantly, empathy. Successful storytelling balances various elements to evoke genuine emotional connections.

```
Case Study: Heart of Darkness
**Summary:**

In Joseph Conrad’s novella "Heart of Darkness", the protagonist, Charles Marlow, embarks on a journey up the Congo River during the 1890s to retrieve a cargo of ivory and the company’s agent, Kurtz, who is believed to have gone rogue. Throughout his journey, Marlow encounters various accounts of Kurtz, painting him in contrasting lights. While some describe Kurtz as menacing and savage, others view him as a civilized individual with artistic inclinations. 

The story allows for multiple interpretations. One perspective sees Marlow as a seeker of truth, attempting to unravel the mystery of Kurtz's identity, emphasizing a theme of Insight vs. Ignorance. Another reading portrays Marlow as morally adrift, challenging the European belief of colonialism as a civilizing force and exploring themes of Purity vs. Corruption. In this interpretation, Marlow hopes to find innate goodness in the primal state of human nature through Kurtz.

However, upon meeting Kurtz, Marlow discovers a dark transformation: Kurtz has become a brutal leader, revered like a deity by the local tribesmen. Depending on the lens through which the story is viewed, Marlow's realization could either underscore the unpredictability of human identity or highlight the inherent savagery of human nature.

Ultimately, the story emphasizes that understanding its core values shapes the reader's perception of the characters and their motivations. 
```

**Summary:**

**Reader/Audience Perception:**
1. **Text Versus Subtext**: Readers engage with a story on both the explicit level (text) and the underlying level (subtext). While the text presents outward actions and dialogues, the subtext hints at the character's internal thoughts and emotions. Different mediums—literature, film, theater—convey these dimensions differently. For instance, in films, actors and various other elements combine to present the subtext, while in literature, readers use their imagination and personal experiences to interpret it.

2. **Free Will Versus Fate**: Stories often pose a dichotomy between characters' free will and predetermined fate. At a story's outset, the protagonist's journey seems open to infinite possibilities. However, by the conclusion, actions and outcomes may appear inevitable. The writer must carefully pace the story so that characters' apparent freedoms at the start lead to inevitable conclusions, providing readers with a satisfying understanding of the story's events.

3. **Mystery / Suspense / Dramatic Irony**: These are narrative techniques that play with the timeline and information disparity between the audience and the characters.
   - **Mystery**: Readers/audiences have less information than the characters.
   - **Suspense**: Readers/audiences and characters share the same level of knowledge.
   - **Dramatic Irony**: Readers/audiences know more than the characters.

Examples include films like "Double Indemnity" and "Sunset Blvd." and novels like "The Sympathizer", where various elements of these techniques are employed to maintain engagement.

**The Power of First Impressions**: The initial introduction of a character, especially the protagonist, is crucial as it sets the tone for the rest of the narrative. A memorable entrance can create intrigue and provide insights into the character's core essence. Examples from film, literature, and TV, such as the entrance of Rick in "Casablanca" or Villanelle's act in "Killing Eve", highlight the significance of impactful character introductions.


# **PART 4 CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS**
*People often hide parts of themselves from others and sometimes even from themselves, with certain truths only being perceived by external observers. Similarly, in fiction, a character doesn't connect on all levels with another single character. To fully unveil a character's multifaceted nature, they should be surrounded by a diverse cast. Each member of this cast will evoke specific traits and truths from the central character, allowing the reader or audience to understand the character more deeply by the story's climax. The main idea is that every character in a story should help reveal aspects of other characters. The challenge for writers is to design a cast that effectively brings out the depth and complexity of each character.*
# 17 CAST DESIGN
**Summary:**

A character's journey is never straightforward; it's influenced by a maze of relationships and external factors, not just their core self. Characters in a story impact one another and are defined by their links, contrasts, and oppositions. A well-designed cast highlights the unique traits of each character, especially as they interact and react to one another. These interactions can lead to conflicts and transformations in relationships. When creating a story, a writer must carefully design the cast by comparing and contrasting their characters. Not every imagined character deserves a spot in the story; each one must serve a specific purpose that enhances the narrative. For readers to be deeply engaged, characters shouldn't be simply black or white but should have complex oppositions. The upcoming sections will delve into five examples from major storytelling mediums to illustrate the importance of thoughtful cast design.

## CASE STUDY: PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Pride and Prejudice: A Study in Character Design**

In Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice", the main cast revolves around Elizabeth Bennet and her four sisters. Elizabeth is a multifaceted character with various contrasting traits and inner dimensions. The design of her sisters serves to highlight and contrast these dimensions, making Elizabeth's character more distinct.

1. **Elizabeth and Jane**: Jane's naïveté and trust contrast with Elizabeth's intellectual depth and initial prejudgment of Mr. Darcy. While Elizabeth grapples with her contradictory nature—balancing intellect with impulse—Jane remains steadfastly innocent and trusting.

2. **Elizabeth and Mary**: Elizabeth's inner convictions and moral compass are hidden behind her sociable wit, whereas Mary outwardly expresses her moral stance to the point of annoyance, making her socially undesirable.

3. **Elizabeth and Lydia**: Lydia's overtly flirtatious and boisterous nature serves as a stark contrast to Elizabeth's inherent modesty and self-worth.

4. **Elizabeth and Kitty**: Kitty's dependency and weak will provide a counterpoint to Elizabeth's independent spirit and her complex relationship with Mr. Darcy.

Throughout the narrative, interactions between the sisters draw out these contrasts, making each sister unique while placing Elizabeth prominently at the heart of the story.

For a storyteller, understanding the intricate web of character traits and dimensions is crucial. To visualize these relationships, one can use a "Cast Map":

- **Center Circle**: The protagonist, like the multifaceted Elizabeth, is placed in the center, reflecting her complex nature.
  
- **First Outer Circle**: Surrounding the protagonist are primary supporting characters. For example, in "Pride and Prejudice", this includes Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth's sisters, each with their distinct traits and dimensions.
  
- **Second Outer Circle**: These are secondary characters with specific traits but fewer dimensions due to limited storytelling time. Examples are Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Charles Bingley, and Caroline Bingley, among others.
  
- **Third Outer Circle**: Peripheral characters like servants and distant relatives occupy this space.

This approach ensures a well-rounded and dynamic cast that aids in driving the narrative and illuminating the central character's depth.

## CASE STUDY: A FISH CALLED WANDA
**Summary and Clarification:**

**A Fish Called Wanda: A Study in Character and Narrative Design**

*Background:* "A Fish Called Wanda" was co-written by John Cleese and Charles Crichton. The film was critically acclaimed, receiving numerous awards, including an Oscar for Kevin Kline's performance. The concept for the screenplay was born from a casual conversation between Cleese and Crichton, with Cleese expressing a desire to play a barrister and Crichton wanting to incorporate a steamroller scene. This evolved into a comedic film noir satire.

*Story:* Wanda, an American con artist, teams up with her boyfriend, Otto, and London gangsters, George and Ken, to execute a diamond heist. Various layers of betrayals ensue, with Wanda and Otto turning on George, and George double-crossing them by hiding the diamonds. Amidst this chaos, Wanda tries to seduce George’s barrister, Archie, to find the diamonds. The plot thickens with misdirected murder attempts on an elderly witness, which result in the accidental deaths of her pet dogs. The storyline concludes with a dramatic chase, Otto getting run over by a steamroller, and Archie and Wanda escaping together.

*Character Map:* 
- **Archie Leach (John Cleese):** Obsessed with avoiding embarrassment. His three dimensions are: fear/courage, lawyer/criminal, and devotion to others/self. 
- **Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis):** Fascinated by men who speak foreign languages. She is sexually manipulative yet falls genuinely for Archie. 
- **Otto West (Kevin Kline):** Obsessed with Nietzsche and exhibits contrasting traits of intelligence/ignorance and cleverness/confusion. 
- **Ken Pile (Michael Palin):** An animal lover who is apathetic towards humans. 
- **George Thomason (Tom Georgeson):** A professional criminal whose cool demeanor breaks in the face of betrayal. 
- **Wendy Leach (Maria Aitken):** Exudes superiority and arrogance. 
- **Portia Leach (Cynthia Cleese):** Obsessed with her nose and exhibits self-centeredness.
- **Eileen Coady (Patricia Hayes):** An irritable elderly woman obsessed with her pet dogs. 
- The supporting cast includes various characters integral to the narrative but with lesser depth.

## CASE STUDY: SLAVE PLAY
**Case Study Summary: "Slave Play" by Jeremy O. Harris**

**Background:**
"Slave Play" is a provocative modern play written by Jeremy O. Harris. Originally written while Harris was at Yale University, the play opened off-Broadway in 2018, stirring controversy. In 2019, it moved to Broadway, playing to full houses until COVID-19 forced theater closures.

**Plot & Themes:**
Set on a former Virginia plantation, "Slave Play" uses a multi-plot design to delve into race relations, particularly focusing on intimate interracial relationships. The story raises questions about the roots of racism, the intricacies of interracial relationships, and the lingering trauma of slavery.

The narrative is divided into three acts:

- **Act One ("Work")**:
  - Three vignettes are played out depicting sadomasochistic interactions between interracial couples set in an antebellum setting. It appears genuine until two psychotherapists interrupt, revealing that these scenarios were therapeutic exercises for interracial couples experiencing sexual disconnect.

- **Act Two ("Process")**:
  - The couples undergo a therapeutic procedure called Antebellum Sexual Performance Therapy, aiming to restore sexual pleasure in black partners feeling detached from their white counterparts. As the act progresses, the therapy intensifies, leading to painful confrontations and revelations about the couples' real-life challenges with race.

- **Act Three ("Exorcise")**:
  - Focusing on one couple, Kaneisha and Jim, the act explores Kaneisha's struggle with her husband's perceived power over her due to his whiteness. The act culminates in a raw confrontation between the two, touching on the themes of power, privilege, and racial understanding.

**Characters**:
The characters, ranging from highly self-aware to utterly blind to their biases, serve as symbolic representations of various racial perspectives:
- **Kaneisha**: Painfully self-aware and black.
- **Jim**: Blissfully self-deceived and white.
- **Gary**: Black, despises his blackness.
- **Dustin**: White, but denies his whiteness.
- **Phillip**: A mixed-race man who sees himself beyond racial categorization.
- **Alana**: Attracted to the eroticism of blackness.
- **Teá & Patricia**: Two therapists who are contrasting mixtures of sensitivity and insensitivity.

**Conclusion**:
The title "Slave Play" underscores its central theme: the inherent sadomasochism of slavery. The play argues that the deep-rooted cause of slavery and oppression is a sadomasochistic lust for power. It explores the intertwining of power, fear, and sexual desire, suggesting that these dynamics continue to play out in modern racial relations. Harris's work pushes the audience to consider the powerful forces of racism, love, and desire, emphasizing that understanding and confronting these forces is essential for genuine connection and healing.

## Cast Design
**Summary and Clarification:**
**Summary:**

**Character Circles in "Breaking Bad"**

1. **Third Circle Roles:** These characters don't make independent decisions. They simply respond to more important characters. Notable examples related to different main characters like Walt, Jesse, Skyler, and Hank are listed. The essence is that third circle characters have minor roles in the story, supporting primary characters, and aren’t described in detail in the script.

2. **Second Circle Roles:** More significant than third circle roles but not as complex. They can change story trajectories but are more straightforward in characterization. The series has several second circle roles like Steve Gomez, Gale Boetticher, and Jane Margolis, among others.

3. **First Circle Roles:** These are the most detailed and have their subplots. Examples are:
   * Todd: A polite sociopath.
   * Lydia Rodarte-Quayle: A corporate thief with a brutal side.
   * Mike Ehrmantraut: A criminal with a moral code.
   * Saul Goodman: A lawyer with a criminal side.
   * Marie Schrader: A kleptomaniac struggling with identity.
   * Walter White Jr.: A teen growing into an adult amidst family chaos.

   * Gus Fring: A business owner with a criminal empire.
   * Hank: A DEA agent with multiple inner battles.
   * Jesse Pinkman: A former drug addict who undergoes a significant transformation, battling with morality.

4. **Walter White:** The protagonist, Walter, is given the most depth with sixteen dimensions. He's portrayed as a man of contradictions. On the surface, he is a family man, a teacher, and someone who believes in science. But deep down, he is a sociopath, violent, and constantly breaks his own moral code. His hidden character delves even deeper, showing that he values life but is reckless, is rational but impulsive, and lacks self-awareness despite understanding others.

In essence, the series "Breaking Bad" builds its narrative strength through complex characters, especially in the first circle, each exhibiting multiple dimensions and conflicts. The supporting cast, from the second and third circles, adds depth and texture to the storyline, while Walter White's multifaceted nature drives much of the show's tension and plot twists.
