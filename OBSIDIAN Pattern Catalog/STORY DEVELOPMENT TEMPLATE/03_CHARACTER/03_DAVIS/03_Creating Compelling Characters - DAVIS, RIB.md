#03_CHARACTER 

# INTRODUCTION
**Summary and Clarification:**

1. **Holding Audience Attention:** The primary goal of any script is to maintain the audience's interest until the end. If they lose interest and disengage, it indicates the script's failure. 

2. **Character Importance:** The main reason an audience remains engaged is due to their curiosity about "what happens next." This curiosity is intrinsically tied to the characters in the story. If the audience cares about the characters, they'll want to know their fate. Hence, character development and relatability are crucial for a successful script, regardless of the medium (TV, film, stage, or radio).

3. **Script Media:** While there are different mediums for scripts, they have many similarities. For instance, radio drama, which lacks visual effects, can be compared to film in its storytelling dynamics. Despite the differences between film, TV, theater, and radio, essential elements like engaging dialogue, compelling plot, and strong characterization remain consistent.

4. **Against Prescriptive Writing Guides:** The author disapproves of writing guides that strictly dictate what should or shouldn't be done. Many of these guides are narrowly focused on specific film types or styles, which doesn't cater to the vast range of genres and storytelling methods available. For example, a book might claim that main plots should be action-focused and sub-plots relationship-focused, but this doesn't apply universally to every movie or script.

5. **Offered Perspective:** Instead of prescribing rules, the author simply provides advice based on their perspective. They recognize that there are countless ways to approach scriptwriting and character creation. If their advice seems too directive, they preemptively apologize, highlighting that writers are independent thinkers who don't strictly adhere to rules.

# PART ONE Character in the Real World 
## Chapter 1 Roots of a Character 
**Character Creation in Scriptwriting:**

- **Origins of Characters:**
  - Characters can come from varied sources, including real-life individuals, imagination, or a blend of both.
  - Some filmmakers, like the Coen brothers, design characters around specific actors.

- **Drawing from Personal Connections:**
  - Early in writing, many authors base characters on family and friends due to familiarity.
  - Pros: Understanding character nuances, voice, history, and reactions.
  - Cons: Possible loyalty to real-life models may result in a lack of character development and imagination. 

- **Writing Autobiographically:**
  - Using oneself as a character model has advantages but many constraints.
    - Pros: Deep understanding of emotions and motivations.
    - Cons: Reluctance to portray oneself negatively or deviate from personal truths.

- **A Reservoir of Traits:**
  - Character creation doesn't always require basing them on specific individuals.
  - Characters can be a mosaic of traits drawn from various individuals encountered in life.
  - This method allows for more creativity, as characters are not tied to any one real person.

- **The Three Categories of Character Traits:**
  1. **Nature:** Innate characteristics and conditions they're born into.
  2. **Nurture:** Traits and behaviors acquired through life experiences.
  3. **Present:** What the character is like currently, which is often most visible to the audience.

- **Process and Approach:**
  - Not all characters need detailed backgrounds or comprehensive trait lists.
  - Starting with dialogue and action, then evaluating and fleshing out characters, can be more effective than starting with a character study.

In essence, while real-life individuals can provide a solid foundation for character creation, drawing from various experiences and traits offers richer, more diverse characters suitable for storytelling.

## Chapter 2 Birth Marks 
**Summary:**

When creating characters, various facets play a crucial role in determining their depth, relatability, and dynamics:

1. **Gender:** While it's essential to avoid gender stereotypes, understanding general gender-differentiated values and audience expectations can help in crafting unique characters. Characters like Thelma and Louise challenge gender stereotypes, providing nuanced representations.

2. **Race:** While sometimes the race of a character might be central to their experiences, other times it's best left unspecified to avoid undue stereotypes or biases. However, if a story or scene demands specificity due to its context or themes, race becomes a pivotal character element.

3. **Class:** Identifying a character's class can help understand their perspectives, aspirations, and conflicts. While class markers like income and occupation have become more blurred over time, it remains a potent tool to showcase a character's inner world and societal status.

4. **Family Background:** The family environment and relationships shape a person's personality, values, and behavior. Understanding whether a character comes from a warm or cold family, their position among siblings, etc., can offer insights into their motivations and choices.

5. **Name:** Names can give away hints about a character's background, period, or even central traits. While in earlier literature, names often had symbolic meanings, modern characters' names are subtler, carrying less obvious connotations.

To sum up, when crafting characters, a writer should delve deep into their backgrounds, histories, and personal attributes to make them well-rounded and compelling. Understanding their past helps shape their present, even if every detail doesn't find its way into the script. The organic development of both character and plot is paramount for a credible and engaging narrative.

## Chapter 3 Learning through experience

### Education 
**Summary:**

The education a character has received plays a significant role in their development, both academically and socially. In the context of the UK, it's important for a writer to determine the type of schooling a character has experienced, such as private school, comprehensive, and so on. Not just the factual details, but the character's feelings and attitudes towards their education are crucial. For instance, some people might be proud of attending prestigious universities like Oxford or Cambridge and mention it often, while others may have disdain for such institutions even if they attended them. The emphasis is on how the character relates to their education, rather than just the education itself. This relationship provides rich material for characterization in storytelling.

### Abilities 
**Summary:**

Abilities of a character, though interconnected with education and passions, stand distinct in their importance. Abilities are not always gained through formal education; for instance, someone could become an adept sailor later in life without prior experience. Intelligence varies greatly among individuals, and it's crucial to be specific when noting a character's abilities. For example, instead of labeling someone as "intelligent," it's more illustrative to describe them as "perceptive at reading the stock market." Such specificity can hint at deeper aspects of a character's personality and can intrigue the audience. While it might be predictable to give a character abilities aligning with stereotypes, like an aristocrat playing polo, sometimes surprising abilities, such as an aristocrat being a math genius or a lorry driver having psychic abilities, can make characters more memorable. However, an unusual ability isn't the only thing that can make a character stand out; it's just one of many tools available to a writer.
### Own Family
**Summary:**

The term "Own family" refers to the family unit a character creates, such as a spouse, children, and in-laws, as opposed to the family they're born into. Dramas often hinge on conflict, and family settings are rife with conflicts due to their inherent emotional complexities. Such conflicts in family settings intensify the drama because of the inability to easily escape familial ties. For instance, the relationship in "Breaking Bad" between Walter White and Hank Schrader is made more intense because they're family. Placing a conflict within a family magnifies its emotional resonance and implications. Classics like "Hamlet" and "Death of a Salesman" derive much of their intensity from family dynamics.

A significant distinction exists between the family one is born into and the family one creates. The former is unchosen and doesn't carry personal responsibility in the same way. In contrast, the family one creates stems from choices, and thus, the character may bear responsibility for regrets or conflicts within it. The nature and dynamics of these relationships, and a character's attitudes towards them, are crucial to characterization. Not just the facts, but how a character perceives and responds to these familial ties, play a significant role in storytelling.
### Sexuality 
**Summary:**

A character's sexuality, ranging from straight to LGBTQ+, can be a defining trait in some scripts while in others it might be an incidental detail. For instance, in the TV show "Spin City", Carter Heywood's gay identity is central, while in other stories a character's sexuality might not directly affect the plot but adds depth and realism. Sometimes, casting decisions can determine a character's sexuality, as seen in a youth theatre script where a character portrayed God as gay, challenging traditional perceptions.

Sexuality also pertains to sexual attitudes and morality. A character's sexual behavior and preferences, such as being a predator or submissive, can be telling of their moral compass. Changing societal norms over the years have influenced people's views on sex and sexuality. In the 60s and 70s, there was a wave of openness followed by the rise of women's rights, which later saw a shift to a "laddish culture". Recently, there's been an understanding that sexuality is fluid and not confined to labels. Therefore, when creating characters, it's important to consider the era they grew up in as it influences their perspective on sexuality. For authenticity, it's crucial to capture generational differences in attitudes towards sex and sexuality.
### Back-story
**Summary:**

Back-story refers to events in a character's past that shape their present circumstances and personality in a script. While sometimes back-story elements are explicitly depicted in the narrative, like flashbacks, other times they are merely hinted at, influencing the character's motivations and decisions. For instance, "Casablanca" showcases Rick’s past with Ilsa through memories, whereas "Gilda" only alludes to Gilda and Johnny’s past. In "Death of a Salesman", the back-story is dynamically woven into the present as it plays out in Willy's mind. 

When crafting a script, the placement of these back-story elements is crucial. An event could either be portrayed as a back-story, leaving room for doubt and speculation, or shown directly, making it a definite part of the narrative. For example, a story about a woman abused as a teenager could hint at the abuse (back-story) or explicitly show it, which would change the audience's perspective and the script's focus.

Scriptwriters should be adaptable, shifting between using events as plot points or back-story as required. It's vital to approach scriptwriting fluidly, making adjustments as necessary to enhance the overall story.
## Chapter 4 The character now

### Age
**Summary:**

The age of a character in a script is essential, even if other noted characteristics aren't explicitly mentioned. Age influences a character's relationships and foundational attitudes, shaped by the era of their formative years. However, writers can create intriguing narratives by subverting age-related expectations, such as a curious elderly lady interested in romance or a morally concerned teenager lamenting societal decay.
### Occupation 
**Summary:**

Occupation plays a pivotal role in defining characters in a script. How a character perceives their job and how it aligns or contrasts with their personality can offer rich narrative elements. For instance:

1. Occupations can reflect a character's social status, education, class, and ambition. This gives the writer an opportunity to play with societal assumptions and surprise the audience. 
2. The relationship between a character and their job offers insights into their motivations, contentment, and aspirations.
3. In some stories, occupation holds a symbolic significance or central theme, such as the film "Notting Hill" where Hugh Grant’s character’s job as a travel bookshop owner underscores his values and contrasts with the glamorous world of his love interest.
4. Characters in roles with unique or specialized jobs can make them stand out, adding layers to their personalities.
5. Thorough research is vital when detailing a character's profession, ensuring authenticity. However, when it comes to class, race, and regional variations, it's crucial to approach with sensitivity and caution, especially when dealing with unfamiliar speech patterns.

In essence, a character's job is not just about what they do; it's a tool that reveals their world view, their past, and their aspirations, making the story richer and more authentic.
### Friends and enemies
**Summary:**

Characters can often be defined by their relationships, particularly with friends and enemies. In creating one character, writers inevitably begin crafting others that fit into the central character's social world. For example:

- In "The Big Lebowski", the Dude's friends, Donny and Walter, reflect on the Dude's nature. Their personalities and moral compass resonate with the Dude's, offering insights into his character.
- In "The Opposite of Sex", the relationships are more complex. The central character's perception of friends and enemies changes throughout the script, highlighting her internal conflict and emotional journey.

In essence, the company a character keeps and their evolving relationships can offer profound insights into their personality, values, and development throughout a story.
### Appearance
**Summary:**

Physical appearance, while seemingly superficial, can offer significant insights into a character's personality, history, and inner emotions. How one dresses or maintains themselves communicates intent, beliefs, and sometimes even past traumas.

In scripts, character descriptions serve multiple purposes:

1. **Physical Attributes**: It provides details about a character’s physical traits, like the example from "Taxi Driver" that describes Travis Bickle's appearance, from his lean physique to his gaunt cheeks.
 
2. **Psychological Insights**: More than just physical details, descriptions in a script can hint at deeper psychological states, like Travis's loneliness, fear, and repressed sexuality.

3. **Guidance for Production**: The character description isn't just for readers but provides a starting point for the actor, director, and production team. These descriptions can guide costume choices, actor interpretation, and directorial decisions. 

However, it's essential to note that while scripts offer a direction, the final portrayal in a film might differ. The interpretation by actors, directors, and other crew members can bring new layers or nuances to a character, which may not be explicitly present in the script. The key is to ensure the spirit of the characterization remains true, even if specific details change.
### View of the world 
**Summary:**

Every central character in a story should possess a distinct perspective or view of the world. This perspective influences their actions, reactions, and interactions with other characters. In "When Harry Met Sally", written by Nora Ephron, the two main characters exemplify contrasting worldviews: Sally's optimism and Harry's pessimism. While these views might be evident to the audience, it's essential that characters don't overtly describe their perspectives merely to inform viewers, unless there's a genuine reason within the narrative. Incorrectly executed, this can feel forced and unnatural, especially in the hands of novice writers.

However, exceptions exist. There are moments when a character's self-description, especially when juxtaposed against their actions or when expressing a controversial perspective, can be effective and engaging. But writers must exercise caution when embedding explicit self-descriptions in dialogue, ensuring they serve the story and don't merely act as exposition.
### Beliefs
**Summary:**

People generally do not verbalize their core beliefs, but these beliefs guide their actions. Drama is most engaging when it pushes characters (and subsequently the audience) to confront and perhaps reassess their beliefs. A great example is the film "A Civil Action," where a lawyer primarily driven by monetary gain starts to realize that other values may be more important. Yet, motivations should be a mix of clarity and complexity; a character should be both believable and captivating. Simplistic characters may be credible, but if their core beliefs aren't tested, they may lack depth. Conversely, characters can be intriguing but risk losing credibility if their motivations remain too ambiguous, as seen in "The House of Mirth."

While films like "Alive" or "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" challenge widely accepted beliefs, these challenge-focused narratives can sometimes overshadow the depth of individual characters. For richer storytelling, nuanced examinations of characters' beliefs are recommended. While characters voicing their motivations can be tedious, leaving an audience in too much doubt about a character's motivations can be unsatisfactory.
### General Matter
**Summary:**

A character's general manner is influenced by various factors, including their sense of humor, tension level, language use, and worldview. However, even with these factors aside, one can discern a character's general disposition. Questions about whether a character is serious or lighthearted, observant or distracted, arrogant or humble can help define their overall demeanor. 

While generalizations can be limiting, they serve as a useful starting point for character development. An actor's interpretation can shape a character's mannerisms, but a writer's initial portrayal is pivotal. For instance, in Alan Bleasdale's "GBH", a character's escalating physical mannerisms, from a simple hand gesture to a full flailing of the arms, is symbolic of his deteriorating mental state and loss of control.
### Sense of Humor
**Summary:**

A character's sense of humour offers insights into their personality, both in terms of what they find amusing and how they express humor. Characters can be:
1. Naturally witty, exhibiting a quick and sharp mind.
2. Rely on crude or repetitive humor, using double entendres that may become tiresome.
3. Narrators of amusing anecdotes.
4. Traditional joke-tellers, ranging from highly entertaining to mundane.

A character's approach to humor might serve various purposes:
- Lightening conversations.
- Undermining or deflating others.
- As an aggressive tool.
- As a shield to hide vulnerabilities or avoid genuine interactions.

Furthermore, how a character reacts to humor can be telling. Some might laugh easily to fit in or please others, while others might selectively appreciate humor to align with specific groups or show favoritism. Both generating and responding to humor can reveal significant aspects of a character's nature.
### Tension Levels
**Summary:**

Actors often utilize tension levels, ranging from level one (complete relaxation) to level seven (extreme tension), to approach and define their character in a scene. These tension levels can also be beneficial for writers to frame a character's general demeanor.

- **Simon** from *Frasier* is characterized by low tension levels (one or two), exemplifying laziness and indifference. This laid-back nature is a central aspect of his persona, leading to many comedic moments.
  
- **Basil Fawlty** from *Fawlty Towers* is at the other end of the spectrum, continually exhibiting high tension. His tension, resulting from numerous internal frustrations, is a defining trait that leads to both comedic attempts to control and dramatic outbursts of this tension.

Deciding a character's general tension level can offer insights into their overall behavior and reactions. Whether a character is typically calm or volatile, understanding their tension provides a foundation for character development.
### Use of language
**Summary:**

The use of language is vital for depicting a character's personality in storytelling. Language serves not only as a communication tool but also reveals a character's thought process and indicates their class, age, race, location, attitude, and status. When considering a character's use of language, it can be divided into:

1. **Background:** This pertains to the character's upbringing, cultural background, education, and experiences that shape their linguistic habits, revealing aspects like class, age, race, and geographical origins.
 
2. **Style of Speech:** This deals with how a character speaks, including their choice of words, tone, pace, and any unique linguistic quirks or patterns.
### Background
**Summary:**

When developing a character's language:

1. **Background's Influence on Speech:** 
   - A character's background may subtly or overtly shape their way of speaking.
   - Some youths might employ 'youth-speak' either naturally due to their group culture or intentionally to set themselves apart from older generations.
   - Factors like class, race, and regional origin can influence speech, but the key is to focus on the standout characteristics. Overemphasis can lead to cliched representations, such as posh upper-class or overly rustic working-class characterizations.

2. **Gender Differences in Communication:** 
   - While class and background may have apparent influences, gender differences in language are more nuanced.
   - Research suggests that women generally use language in a more supportive manner, avoiding dominating conversations or interrupting in a contradictory way. 
   - It's beneficial to be aware of these tendencies when crafting dialogue, especially for characters who might exhibit these patterns more than usual.
### Style of speech
**Summary:**

**Style of Speech in Character Development:**

1. **Individualization:** Every individual, irrespective of their background, has a unique way of speaking. This individualized style can be reflected in the characters an author creates.

2. **Coherence vs. Incoherence:**
   - Characters might be comfortable and fluent with language, showcasing clarity and command over words. Alternatively, they might display hesitancy, uncertainty, or even contradiction.
   - An example is provided from Harold Pinter’s "The Birthday Party":
      - Goldberg's speech is confident, direct, and assertive, showcasing his comfort with language and his dominant nature.
      - Stanley's speech, in contrast, is hesitant, repetitive, and even contradictory. This reflects an inner confusion and his struggle for self-identity.

3. **Context Matters:**
   - A character's style of speech can vary depending on the situation, and it's unrealistic to expect a character to speak the same way in all circumstances.
   - However, generally, certain characters will have distinct ways of expressing themselves compared to others.

4. **Script’s World Influences Dialogue:**
   - Dialogue should not just be true-to-life but should also fit the established conventions of the script or story world.
   - Goldberg and Stanley from the example share the same story world, and while their language points out their individual characteristics, their speech also contains elements of the world they inhabit: aggression, fear, and certain level of education.

5. **Depth in Dialogue:**
   - Speech can indicate a character’s coherence in thought, level of education, self-perception, and more. 
   - In the given example, Goldberg’s seemingly confident speech also reveals a wandering mind, while Stanley’s incoherence sheds light on his internal conflict.

In character creation, exploring levels of coherence and style of speech can provide depth and distinction to the character's personality.
### Color
**Summary:**

**Use of Colour in Language and Character Development:**

1. **Definition of Colour:** 'Colour' refers to the use of vivid and expressive language, employing similes, metaphors, and other rhetorical devices. Some characters revel in such language, while others shun it.

2. **Goldberg and Stanley’s Speech:** Both characters from the previously mentioned play show minimal use of colorful language. Goldberg’s clichés hint at pretentiousness, while Stanley's plain speech lacks any pomposity.

3. **Shakespearean Examples:**
   - In *Romeo and Juliet*, Mercutio plays with the term 'consort,' which demonstrates his aggression and wit. His manipulation of language isn't just a demonstration but an embodiment of his character.
   - In contrast, Cordelia from *King Lear* uses restrained and direct language, reflecting her honesty and integrity. Her avoidance of "glib and oily art" in speech signifies her belief in straightforwardness over verbal artistry.

4. **Implications of Colour:** While colorful language can make a character seem eloquent or witty, it can also raise suspicion in the audience. Characters who artfully manipulate words might be perceived as less trustworthy or more manipulative.

In character development, the degree to which a character employs "colour" in their speech can reveal or obscure their intentions, motivations, or personality traits.
### The verbal tic
**Summary:**

**The Verbal Tic and Its Implications in Character Development:**

1. **Definition:** A verbal tic refers to the habitual repetition of certain words or phrases in speech, like "You see" or "Know what I mean?"

2. **Alan Bennett’s "Her Big Chance" Example:**
   - Lesley, a minor actress, frequently uses the director’s name, Simon, in a conversation. This behavior was adopted from a handbook's advice.
   - She also overuses the word "interesting."
   - These tics, particularly her overuse of "Simon," indicate her desire to seem closer to people than she actually is. It’s a manifestation of her trying to elevate her status and make connections where none exist.

3. **Character Implications of Verbal Tics:**
   - Tics are not random; they can arise from deeper character elements or insecurities.
   - Verbal tics can convey a character's attempt to assert importance, create familiarity, or manipulate a situation.
   - Overly repetitive tics can be annoying in major characters but can be used strategically for minor ones.
   - A character’s pet phrases can be revealing. In the film "Nadine," Vernon often says "Trust me," implying deceit, but by the film's end, Nadine adopts the phrase, signifying a shift in power and trust dynamics.

Verbal tics, when used thoughtfully, can provide insights into a character’s motivations, personality, and relationships with others.
### Pastimes and passions
**Summary:**

**The Role of Pastimes and Passions in Character Development:**

1. **Variety in Humanity:** People have a wide range of interests and hobbies, and reflecting this variety makes characters more realistic and engaging.
  
2. **Insight from the Coen Brothers:** Their successful storytelling often taps into characters' unique passions, from rock-climbing to beetle collecting.

3. **Setting & Personality Insight:** A character's passion can provide unique settings for scenes. Moreover, their chosen pastime can reveal personality traits. For instance, rock climbing might indicate a love for adventure, while beetle collecting might suggest meticulousness.

4. **Choice vs. Circumstance:** While many aspects of our lives feel pre-determined (like birthplace or socio-economic status), our hobbies often arise from personal choice, revealing more about our true selves. However, economic limitations can restrict some choices.

5. **Passion vs. Expertise:** A character can be deeply passionate about something without necessarily being skilled at it.

6. **Depth Through Passions:** Characters who have clear passions or interests are generally more engaging. While there's nothing wrong with characters who seem to lack strong passions (e.g., those who mainly work, watch TV, and visit the pub), a script dominated by such characters needs other strong elements to keep the audience interested.

7. **Relationships vs. Individual Passions:** While some characters may be primarily devoted to others (like parents dedicated to their children), it's worth exploring their individual passions or suppressed desires. Discovering or revisiting these can add depth to a character and present opportunities for growth or change.

In essence, exploring a character's pastimes and passions can provide depth, nuance, and realism, enriching the narrative and offering audiences a deeper connection to the story.
### Delusions
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Role of Delusions in Scriptwriting and Character Development:**

1. **Avoiding Dullness:** A common pitfall in writing is making everything too clear-cut. When characters always say exactly what they mean and there are no underlying nuances, the story can become tedious.

2. **Engaging the Audience:** Engaging scripts require the audience to do some interpretative work. Subtext—unspoken desires, hidden motivations, or covert emotions—can make the narrative more compelling. If an audience can discern the underlying meaning or intention behind a character's actions or words, they become more invested.

3. **Importance of Gaps:** A gap exists between a character's outward actions or statements and their underlying intentions or beliefs. This gap draws the audience in, prompting them to try and understand the character's true motivations.

4. **Character Delusion:** One effective gap to exploit is the difference between a character's self-perception and how they actually are. This isn't about deceit but self-delusion. This gap can be a source of comedy, tension, or depth.

5. **Example from "Her Big Chance":** Lesley, a minor actress, sees herself in a much grander light than reality supports. Her delusions, when juxtaposed against the audience's understanding, make for a mix of humor and sympathy. The audience fills in the gaps regarding her misconceptions, such as her mistaken belief about having a "working relationship" with Roman Polanski or thinking she impresses a director with minor details. Alan Bennett effectively uses the director's reserved reactions to keep the gap wide, allowing the audience to be amused by Lesley's delusions without feeling too sorry for her.

6. **Incorporating Delusion in Characters:** When crafting characters, consider where they might be deluded about themselves. Does a character overestimate or underestimate their skills or popularity? Are they mistaken about their attractiveness or abilities?

In essence, leveraging characters' delusions can add depth, humor, and relatability to a narrative, ensuring the audience remains engaged and active in understanding the unfolding story.
### Hundreds of attributes 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Diversity of Character Attributes:**

1. **Character Complexity:** The author highlights that while he's touched upon several character traits, there are countless more that can shape a fictional individual. By developing a thorough list of these traits, writers can craft well-rounded and multi-dimensional characters.

2. **Examples of Attributes:** The list provided ranges from the psychological, like independent vs. dependent or optimist vs. pessimist, to the physical, like attractiveness or smell, to the circumstantial, such as socio-economic background or past traumas. Each trait offers a spectrum rather than a binary choice. 

3. **Usage of the List:** The author recommends referring to this extensive list when shaping a character. By considering each trait, a writer can both refine their understanding of the character and potentially discover new, defining attributes. These traits don't just determine how a character behaves but can influence their history, relationships, and overall narrative role.

4. **Beyond Binary Traits:** Every trait is on a spectrum. For instance, a character might not just be demanding or easy-going but can exhibit varying degrees of these traits in different situations or with different people.

5. **Potential for Further Structuring:** The list, as comprehensive as it is, can still be expanded or categorized differently. The author seems to suggest that while this list is helpful, there might be another, perhaps more organized, method to categorize and consider character attributes.

In essence, when creating characters, it's beneficial for writers to think broadly and deeply about all possible traits and influences that might define an individual, ensuring a rich and believable portrayal.
### The big five
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Big Five Personality Traits:**

Psychologists widely recognize five core dimensions of personality:

1. **Extraversion:** This spectrum ranges from extroverted characters, who are sociable and expressive, to introverted ones, who are more reserved and less openly emotive.
 
2. **Openness:** Represents a character's receptiveness to new experiences. Those with high openness are imaginative, intellectually curious, and adventurous, while those at the lower end are more routine-bound and less explorative.

3. **Neuroticism:** Refers to emotional stability. Neurotic characters often experience negative emotions and insecurity, while their counterparts are more emotionally stable, potentially to the point of appearing dull.

4. **Agreeableness:** This encompasses one's cooperative nature. Highly agreeable characters are empathetic and trusting, while less agreeable ones tend to be more competitive and confrontational.

5. **Conscientiousness:** Reflects one's approach to tasks. Conscientious characters are methodical, goal-oriented, and detail-focused, whereas those on the opposite end are disorganized and more spontaneous.

**Applying the Big Five in Character Creation:**

- These categories serve as a foundational tool for writers. They allow for the creation of complex characters with traits that might seem contradictory but are genuine to human nature. For instance, a character can be extroverted and agreeable but also suffer from anxiety.

- When developing a character, consider where they might fall on each spectrum to ensure depth and authenticity.

**Perception of Characters:**

- The way a character is perceived can vary among individuals. One person might see a character in a particular light based on their experiences and interpretations, while another might view them differently.

- This subjective nature of perception exists both in real life and in narrative contexts. As a writer, it's essential to understand that there's no single truth about a character. Instead, multiple truths arise based on varying perceptions.

- Most crucially, a writer's primary responsibility isn't just portraying the 'truth' of a character, but managing the audience's perception of them.

**Character Motivation:**

- Beyond these personality traits, a fundamental aspect of a character is their desires or "wants." These desires directly link to a character's motivations, which, in turn, are deeply intertwined with the narrative's plot.

- The progression from understanding a character's traits to their motivations signals a shift from viewing them as standalone entities to examining their role and function within a storyline.

# PART TWO Character Within Script

## Chapter 5 Character motivation and the plot

### Threaten it
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Concept of Super-Objectives:**
- Super-objectives refer to overarching goals or desires that individuals may not be consciously aware of but drive their actions. For instance, wanting "to be a respected member of the community" or aiming "to raise a happy family" can be considered super-objectives.
- Though these goals may appear ordinary or even mundane, they have profound significance when explored in a narrative context.

**Importance in Storytelling:**
- Rather than merely presenting a realistic slice of life, plays and films intensify and bring clarity to these super-objectives. This often involves putting these objectives under threat.
- By challenging a super-objective, writers can push characters to their limits, leading them to cross emotional, moral, or even legal boundaries. This dynamic not only drives the story forward but also provides a deeper understanding of the character's essence.

**Examples:**
1. A character who values their status in the community could be threatened by past indiscretions or false rumors. This scenario tests the lengths they would go to preserve their reputation.
2. A character who cherishes the idea of a perfect family could face threats not just from external forces but also from internal dynamics. For instance, the challenges of maintaining familial harmony amidst infidelity or conflicting views on parenting can serve as obstacles.
   
**Deeper Exploration:**
- The best super-objectives often have layers of complexity. For instance, a character striving for a "happy family" might ultimately be seeking validation or admiration, both from others and themselves. This realization can lead to a more profound exploration of their motivations and vulnerabilities.

In essence, super-objectives are powerful tools in storytelling, enabling writers to delve deep into characters' psyches, create compelling conflicts, and offer audiences rich, emotional journeys.
### Being super-supered 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Super-Objectives and their Variability:**
- A character's super-objective is their main driving force or goal. However, these super-objectives can change or be superseded by other priorities, which can be termed as "super-super-objectives".
- For instance, a character initially wants to get rich (super-objective) but then prioritizes staying alive when threatened (super-super-objective).

**Hierarchy of Objectives:**
- There can be many layers to objectives: primary goals, secondary goals, and so on. For clarity in storytelling, it often helps to decide on one main super-objective per character.
- While it's often suggested that a character should have only one super-objective, this doesn't mean characters should be overly simplistic or one-dimensional. The super-objective should serve as a guide, not a constraint.

**Examples:**
1. In the film *Pink Cadillac*, the protagonist seems to want a quiet life (potential super-objective). However, his actions, driven by his relationship with a woman and the subsequent events, make this super-objective unclear, leading to a somewhat vague narrative.
2. In contrast, *The African Queen* offers a clear shift in the protagonist's super-objective, from wanting a quiet life to avenging a loved one's death and aiding the war effort.

**Concluding Notes:**
- A character's super-objective can change, especially in stories centered around self-discovery. For a narrative to be compelling, any change in super-objective should be evident and directly impact the plot's direction.
- It's essential to have clarity regarding a protagonist's super-objective to ensure a strong and cohesive storyline.
### The great fear
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Central Motivation through Great Fear:**
- Another approach to understanding a character's core motivation is by identifying their "great fear" rather than just focusing on their super-objective.
- This great fear can be a secret from their past, a hidden aspect of their identity, or an insecurity they grapple with.
  
**Examples:**
1. In *American Beauty*, the aggressive neighbor's primary fear is acknowledging his own sexuality. This fear is pivotal in driving the story's events, especially his hostile reactions to his son, whom he wrongly believes to be homosexual. His inadvertent exposure to this truth culminates in the film's climax.
2. In *Othello*, the titular character's profound dread lies in his insecurity about his appeal as a black man married to a white woman. He is deeply afraid of being betrayed or cuckolded, which steers the play's tragic events.

**Conclusion:**
- Recognizing a character's most profound fear can be as instructive as determining their super-objective. Both methods aim to uncover what the character deeply desires or wants to avoid, which then propels the narrative forward.
### What you want, what you really really 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Character vs. Characterization:**
- Augusto Boal, in his book "Games for Actors and Non-Actors," differentiates between the terms 'character' and 'characterization'.
- 'Character' refers to a static description of an individual, detailing their traits and background.
- 'Characterization,' on the other hand, is dynamic. It incorporates the element of "will," representing what a character desires or aspires to achieve.
- Boal expands on Stanislavski's idea that a character isn't just a static state but is fundamentally active.

**Significance of Specific Wants:**
- Boal emphasizes that for characterization to be effective, the character's desires or wants must be explicit and particular.
- A character's want shouldn't be vague but should be tied to specific circumstances, people, places, or timeframes.
- These specific wants breathe life into the character, making them more than just a mere description, and drive the narrative forward by fueling actions.

In essence, while a character can be seen as a fixed description of an individual, it is their specific desires and actions, their characterization, that truly animate them and propel a story.
### The counter-will
**Summary and Clarification:**

**The Concept of Counter-will:**
- Augusto Boal, in discussing character motivations, introduces the idea of 'counter-will'.
- A character’s motivation isn't one-dimensional. Instead of just having a singular desire, characters often experience internal conflicts between their primary objective and a counteracting desire.
- This internal conflict creates depth and richness to a character's portrayal, making them more relatable and complex.

**Examples and Insights:**
- Hamlet wishes to avenge his father's death, but he's hesitant to kill his uncle, reflecting his counter-will.
- Brutus wants to kill Julius Caesar, but his love for him holds him back.
- Macbeth desires to be king but is reluctant to murder his guest to achieve this.
- Romeo and Juliet are deeply in love, but Boal suggests they might also have reservations or irritations towards each other, forming a potential counter-will.

**Relevance for Actors and Writers:**
- For actors, understanding the counter-will of their character can add layers to their performance, making it more authentic.
- For writers, incorporating this internal struggle elevates characters from being two-dimensional to multifaceted beings.
- Characters devoid of any internal conflict or counter-will become less engaging for the audience.
- A character's memorability and depth aren't solely based on their primary motivations but also on their internal conflicts and how they manage opposing desires.

In essence, the concept of 'counter-will' emphasizes the internal struggles that characters experience between their desires and opposing feelings or reservations. This duality and inner conflict make characters more relatable, intriguing, and complex, contributing significantly to the richness of a story.
### What we want from...
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Focus on Wants and Counter-will in a Scene:**
- While understanding a character's general wants and counter-will is essential, within a specific scene, it's crucial to pinpoint what one character desires from another.
- This shift gives depth to the scene by making motivations immediate, specific, and dynamic.

**Example and Insights:**
- Consider a meeting between Nick and a script editor named Alison. Instead of only pondering Nick’s general objectives, one should ask what Nick specifically wants from Alison during that meeting.
- Similarly, the scene will not be compelling if only Nick's perspective is considered. One must also examine what Alison desires from Nick.

**Balancing Wants for a Compelling Scene:**
- If only one character's wants are explored, with the other character being passive, the scene can become one-dimensional and uninteresting.
- Every character in a scene has their motivations and desires. For a scene to be captivating, the wants and desires of all characters involved must be thoroughly explored.

In essence, while understanding general motivations is essential, it's equally crucial to delve into the specific wants and needs of characters within each scene. This approach ensures that the scene is balanced, dynamic, and engaging.
### The complex character 
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Complex Characters versus Flat Characters:**
- The author recounts writing a radio play called "Can’t Complain", inspired by a memorable woman he met. The character, Dolly, is a vivid talker, jumping from topic to topic, with a mix of truth, exaggeration, and fiction. 
- Though she was a colorful character, she lacked depth and was two-dimensional. The play felt static because her motivations and goals weren't clear. Essentially, a vibrant personality doesn't necessarily make a well-rounded character.
  
**Contrast with a Complex Character:**
- The character of Little Billy in the film "Unforgiven" serves as a contrasting example. He is a brutal man with a clear super-objective to control his community. However, he has a softer side, evidenced by his passion for building a house. 
- His dream of building this house, despite his ineptitude, showcases a human side. This added depth makes him more than just a cardboard villain. Little Billy's character suggests there might be traces of goodness within him, leading to thoughts of "what if?" regarding his past choices.

**Key Takeaway:**
- For a character to be compelling, they must have complexities, contradictions, or unexpected aspects. While having a super-objective is essential, characters should also have elements of counter-will or hints of alternative paths they might have taken. These layers make characters feel human and relatable, rather than just one-dimensional.
### Character and plot: An organic process
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Character and Plot Development: An Integrated Approach**
- While initially presented as separate entities, character and plot development are organically intertwined processes in successful storytelling. They often evolve hand-in-hand rather than sequentially.
  
**The Evolution of Characters in Scriptwriting:**
- Story or plot ideas often lead to the development of specific types of characters. As characters are fleshed out, their unique traits can influence and alter the plot direction.
- During the writing process, characters can seem to take on a life of their own, occasionally veering away from the initial plan. 
- It's essential for writers to be flexible and allow these organic developments, as they can breathe life into the narrative and characters. Yet, writers maintain the final decision on whether to stick with these spontaneous shifts or revert to the original plan.

**Objectives and Super-Objectives in Character Development:**
- Characters' objectives and super-objectives aren't just characterization tools; they are central to driving the plot forward.
- For instance, in *Breaking Bad*, Walter White's super-objective to be acknowledged as a brilliant chemist propels the entire storyline, ultimately leading to his downfall. The interplay between character motivation and the unfolding events showcases how protagonists can transform into antagonists.

**Character Motivation and Plot Coherence:**
- Plot isn’t a mere succession of events; it's about how events are linked through character motivations.
- Without coherent motivations and goals from the characters, a script may seem directionless, where events occur without rhyme or reason. 
- Such a script might be more of a story than a plot, and while some writers might be content with it, finding a willing producer can be a challenge.

**In essence**, for a script to be compelling, characters and their motivations should be intrinsically tied to the plot's progression. It's an organic process where one influences and reshapes the other, creating a cohesive narrative.
### Plot-drive, character driven
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Plot-driven vs. Character-driven Narratives:**
- **Plot-driven narratives** emphasize events where characters predominantly react to the unfolding situations. The story's main focus is the sequence of events, and characters mainly facilitate the progression of these events.
- **Character-driven narratives** emphasize the exploration of character personalities and emotions, with the story's events arising as a consequence of their actions, desires, and growth.

**Case Study: 'No Way Out' by Robert Garland**
- At first glance, *No Way Out* may seem plot-driven due to the numerous challenges the protagonist faces. However, upon closer examination, it merges both plot-driven and character-driven elements.
- Two primary reasons for this are:
  1. The film's events aren’t just random occurrences but are consequences of the motivations and objectives of the key characters.
  2. The protagonist, besides reacting to events, also takes decisive actions that influence the story's course.
  
- The plot intricately intertwines with character objectives, making it hard to label the film purely as "plot-driven." For instance, the protagonist's initial involvement with the female character stems from her connection with his boss, and it's later revealed that his true motive is to keep his identity as a Soviet agent hidden.
  
- The emotional journey of the protagonist is central to the story. Despite his ulterior motives, his genuine feelings for the woman are evident. The plot not only reveals the depths of his character to the audience but also forces self-revelation, as he grapples with his own identity and allegiances.

**Conclusion:**
- High-quality writing often blurs the lines between plot-driven and character-driven narratives. While a plot can force characters into revealing hidden aspects of their personalities, characters' actions and growth can also steer the plot in new directions.
  
- Instead of mere character development, this dynamic interplay results in character revelation: the unfolding of a character's multifaceted nature, both to the audience and to the character himself.
### A character in three acts
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Three-act Structure in Storytelling:**
- The classic **three-act structure** in scripts and films can be broken down as:
  1. **Set-up (Act I):** Introduction of characters, setting, and initial conflict.
  2. **Development (Act II):** Exploration of conflicts and challenges faced by characters.
  3. **Resolution (Act III):** Concluding the story, addressing conflicts, and revealing outcomes.

- This structure is familiar to playwrights, screenwriters, and even extends to other art forms like music. While the structure is malleable, with variations like flashbacks, double endings, and teasers, it remains a prevalent narrative framework.

**Character vs. Plot in the Three-act Structure:**
- While the boundaries between plot-driven and character-driven narratives are often blurred, there are instances where a script might lean too heavily on one aspect. This can lead to a script that feels imbalanced or unsatisfying.
  
- For instance, *Billy Elliot* was critiqued for its shift in narrative drive. The film begins as a character-driven story focused on Billy's passion for ballet, but transitions into a more plot-driven narrative in its latter half. Such shifts can lead to the perception that the story changes its central focus.

- A common pitfall of the three-act structure is the temptation to focus extensively on character development in the first act and then divert to primarily advancing the plot in the second act. The third act might offer some character "learning" or revelation, but this can often feel insufficient.

**Conclusion:**
- While the three-act structure provides a solid foundation for storytelling, it's crucial for writers to maintain a balance between character exploration and plot progression throughout the narrative. The interactions, objectives, and conflicts between characters should continue to fuel the story's development, preventing the plot from overshadowing character depth and growth.
### Development or revelation?
**Summary and Clarification:**

**Character Development vs. Character Revelation:**

1. **Traditional View of Character Development:**
   - Many books about scriptwriting discuss the concept of "character development," suggesting characters should evolve over time due to their experiences.
   - The idea of a "character arc" relates to this evolution, depicting both emotional journeys and personal growth.

2. **Questioning the Authenticity of Development:**
   - The author questions the realism of substantial character change. While opinions and preferences might change, core personality traits often remain consistent.
   - Real-life experiences show that expecting or forcing someone to change is frequently met with disappointment.

3. **Introduction of Character Revelation:**
   - Instead of genuine change, the author proposes that most narratives display "character revelation." This perspective argues that characters don't necessarily develop new traits but instead uncover existing ones as they encounter new situations.
   - For instance, a woman, initially perceived as bitter in an unsatisfying relationship, might display affection and warmth in a more fulfilling one. These positive traits were always present, just hidden or suppressed due to circumstances.

4. **Benefits of Character Revelation:**
   - **Honesty:** Viewing character transformation as "revelation" rather than "development" feels more true to life, challenging the misleading notion that people can radically change.
   - **Complexity:** Character revelation recognizes the multifaceted nature of personalities. Instead of shifting from one trait to another, characters reveal hidden aspects of themselves, making for more compelling narratives. This also emphasizes internal struggles and conflicting desires.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The author prefers to see character arcs as revealing hidden aspects rather than evolving new ones. Though the term "character development" is widely accepted, it's essential to understand that most "development" actually pertains to "revelation"—uncovering parts of one's identity previously obscured to both the individual and the audience.

## Chapter 6 Past and present
**Summary:**

The text discusses the importance and significance of "back-story" in narratives, highlighting how it is used to reveal the character and the plot. A back-story refers to the series of events that occurred prior to the main storyline. The text uses two film examples, "Citizen Kane" and "The Imitation Game", and a television play, "Spend, Spend, Spend", to illustrate how back-stories can be employed effectively. 

In "Citizen Kane", the back-story and the present day action intertwine to reveal the true nature of the protagonist. Meanwhile, "The Imitation Game" uses three different timelines to showcase the complexities of Alan Turing's character. "Spend, Spend, Spend" demonstrates how back-story can make the present narrative more vivid, allowing the audience to sympathize with and understand the main character, Vivian. 

The back-story is not just a simple recounting of past events, but rather it is used to elucidate the reasons behind a character's traits and actions. It helps the audience feel a particular way about the character, thus making the narrative more impactful and the character more compelling.


*Vivian reminisces about past events and the what-ifs, particularly about a football match where if Motherwell had scored and Stockport didn't tie with Oldham, their life might've been different, perhaps with a better-furnished home. Vivian ponders about the advice of not dwelling in the past but argues that it can sometimes offer clarity on one's identity. She accepts that some of her life's misfortunes might be her fault, alluding to her own vulnerabilities or flaws. Yet, she points out that there are people, like bank managers and newspapermen, who exploit such vulnerabilities for their gain. She expresses a sense of disillusionment about money, highlighting that people like her and Keith find it mysterious. Vivian recalls the irony of winning the pools (a betting or lottery game) and choosing "No Publicity", which suggests they didn't want the attention. Despite the hardships she faced in her old street, to the point of wanting death, she admits those times were the most memorable for her.*
## Chapter 7 Struggle and the emotional journey
**Summary and Clarification:**

Writers should immerse themselves emotionally in their characters' journeys, just as the characters themselves do. It's essential for writers to truly love and understand their characters, akin to the way they love and understand themselves. This doesn't mean a mere empathetic understanding but rather a complete embodiment of the character's emotions, motivations, and actions. Even if the actions or motivations are morally questionable, writers must allow themselves to fully step into the shoes of the character. By doing this, they can ensure an authentic representation of the character on the page.

This embodiment goes beyond simply planning the character. The writer must genuinely feel and experience the emotions and actions of their characters as they write. This deep connection might lead to writers unconsciously mimicking their characters' expressions and emotions. While it might look odd to outsiders, it's crucial for the authenticity of the character. All characters, not just the main ones, require this level of immersion.

After finishing a scene, writers should revisit it, focusing on individual characters to ensure a consistent and believable character arc throughout the scene. This ensures that each character not only reacts to others but also has their unique narrative and presence.
### Emotional identification
**Summary and Clarification:**

Emotional identification with characters is crucial for a strong connection between the audience and the story. While many believe that audience identification stems from relatable life situations depicted in films or plays, the actual core of this connection is the emotional journey of the characters. For instance, using the example of Tom Hanks in "Cast Away," it's not the physical situation of being stranded on a desert island that resonates with viewers but the emotional challenges he faces: isolation, life evaluation, confrontation with mortality, and the search for inner strength.

The premise is that audiences identify more with the emotional experiences of characters rather than their specific circumstances. Even if the audience hasn't been in the exact physical situation as the character, they can still connect if they recognize the emotional journey. A genuine emotional reality will enable a stronger connection with the audience, though it's just the starting point for a good script.
### Conflict and character 
**Summary and Clarification:**

Drama thrives on the principle of "development of character through conflict." Over time, the understanding of this principle has evolved, suggesting that character change is more about revealing a character's true self through challenges. Regardless of the exact phrasing, the essence remains that characters, especially protagonists, should experience change in the narrative due to the conflicts they face.

Not all films or plays require deep character development. For instance, early James Bond films didn’t emphasize the growth of Bond as a character; they focused more on action and certain expected elements of the franchise. However, as times changed, even this franchise began incorporating more character depth, as seen in "Skyfall," to compete with movies like the Bourne series.

Character development in movies provides viewers with hope. For instance, "Pretty Woman" showcases the development of both the prostitute and the businessman, showing that regardless of their life situations, individuals can change, discover dormant parts of themselves, and find happiness. This theme resonates with audiences since everyone yearns for positive change in their lives and often seeks meaningful relationships to bring about that change.

Movies like "Groundhog Day" and "Sommersby" take character development a step further by presenting protagonists who either live the same day repeatedly or assume someone else’s life to understand and change their flaws, respectively. These stories play on the universal wish of having a second chance in life or to be someone else momentarily to rectify mistakes.

However, not all characters embrace change. Ibsen’s "A Doll’s House" offers a stark example with its character, Nora. She undergoes a significant transformation, challenging societal norms of her time. Nora evolves from a docile wife to a woman who realizes her worth and desires more than her doll-like existence. By the end, she recognizes the superficial nature of her marriage. In contrast, her husband, Torvald, remains static, unable and unwilling to understand or adapt to the changes in Nora.

Thus, in drama, providing characters the opportunity to change, whether they seize it or not, is almost as crucial as the change itself.
### Conflict and choice
**Summary:**

The connection between conflict and choice is integral to character development in storytelling. Characters evolve through the choices they make, often prompted by conflicts they encounter. These choices may be between two opposing desires or paths, and while some choices are trivial, those in dramas should be consequential, impacting the character’s life. This element of decision-making is not just for the characters; audiences are also emotionally involved, often wishing to guide the characters' choices. This emotional investment is vital for a successful script.

The play "Blue Heart" by Caryl Churchill exemplifies this fascination with choices and "what could have been." Different scenarios in the play showcase how a change in choice can drastically alter outcomes. The play serves as a metaphor for the countless paths our lives could take based on our decisions.

Conflicts in storytelling can be external or internal. External conflicts could be against another person, an animal, or nature. However, for a story to truly resonate, it should portray the internalization of these external conflicts, resulting in internal struggles. This internal turmoil allows the audience to connect more deeply with the character and make choices on their behalf. A story without internal conflict might fail to engage the audience, as observed in some movies like "The Perfect Storm."

In Western culture, particularly due to its Judeo-Christian roots, the narrative often centers on the concept of opposing forces like Good and Evil. This cultural foundation supports the idea that conflict is the engine of drama. Like in music and visual arts where there's a pull between discord and harmony or between various visual elements, drama requires action and conflict, culminating in a resolution. If this resolution is reached prematurely in a story, interest wanes. Therefore, it's essential that conflict remains present, fueling character development and audience engagement.
### Choices lead to learning
**Summary:**

Characters' actions, which arise from their choices, reveal their true nature. These choices often stem from conflicts or struggles they face, and as these choices increase in gravity, they provide deeper insights into the character's psyche. 

Taking the example of Shakespeare’s "Coriolanus", the protagonist initially faces straightforward physical conflicts, battling enemies and displaying pride and disdain for the common people. As the story unfolds, Coriolanus' choices become more complex: he refuses to ask for the people's support traditionally, revealing his innate pride and the influence of his aggressive mother, Volumnia. 

Despite the people's disapproval, Coriolanus, prompted by his mother, tries to be humble but fails, which results in his banishment. This exile then leads him to another profound decision: joining forces with his previous enemy, Aufidius, and going against his own city, Rome. This action unveils his loyalty isn't to his land but possibly only to himself or a specific segment of Rome. 

The climax of his decision-making comes when he's outside Rome, ready for attack. Torn between the pleas of his family and the desire for revenge, Coriolanus decides to push for peace. This decision, influenced primarily by his mother’s wishes, seals his fate, leading to his eventual demise. Through these series of choices, it's evident that Coriolanus, the once mighty warrior, is profoundly influenced by his mother, making choices to earn her approval.
### Choices defining identity
**Summary:**

In various plays and films, characters are often confronted with escalating conflicts that force them to make choices. These choices don't just move the plot forward; they fundamentally define the character's identity. In "Coriolanus," the protagonist's decisions, each more significant than the last, culminate in a revelation of his true self. Similarly, in Arthur Miller’s "The Crucible," the character John Proctor faces a choice that directly questions and ultimately defines his identity. Other works, like Sam Shepard’s "True West," Frank McGuinness’ "The Factory Girls," "The African Queen," and the film "As Good As It Gets," also emphasize the role of choice in shaping or revealing a character's essence. The choices made by protagonists in these narratives aren't merely about advancing the plot but are intrinsically tied to who these characters truly are and who they become.
### Choices lead to actions
**Summary:**

Characters in narratives are best understood by the audience through the choices they make and the resulting actions. While dialogue can offer insight into a character, it's their actions that truly define them. This emphasis on action aligns with the philosophies of theater practitioners like Stanislavski and Boal. The protagonist, being the central character, should engage in the most impactful actions which shouldn't just be of consequence to others, but also deeply personal.

Using movies as examples:

- In "A Few Good Men", Daniel Kaffee's confrontation with Colonel Jessep is not just about unveiling a corrupt military system but also about Kaffee's transformation from someone seeking easy solutions to someone willing to risk it all for the truth.
  
- In "Erin Brockovich", the title character’s fight against a large business conglomerate isn't just about justice for the victims of pollution. It's also about Erin, a struggling single mother, reinventing her self-image and gaining respect against all odds.

These characters, and many others, undergo emotional journeys shaped by the choices they make and the actions they take. These choices and actions not only advance the plot but also intricately weave the character's essence, revealing their complexities and making them memorable.
### A journey of discovery 
**Summary:**

A protagonist's emotional journey often involves a process of discovery, revealing their true potential. It's essential for this change to be believable, requiring a transition from one aspect of their personality to another. Often, tragedies arise when characters cannot adapt or change in the face of challenges. To emphasize the depth of the journey, writers frequently start their protagonists in a position that's vastly different from where they end up. For instance, in "Unforgiven," Clint Eastwood's character begins as a man who has renounced violence, which emphasizes his subsequent transformation.

In Maria Irene Fornés' play "Mud," the story centers on Mae, a young woman living in impoverished conditions and taking care of Lloyd, a sick, illiterate young man. Their co-dependent relationship is complicated when Henry, an older man, becomes Mae's partner and later becomes paralyzed, further straining their dynamics. Throughout the play, Mae's journey is about seeking emancipation, even though her circumstances seem to constantly trap her. By the end of the play, Mae finally decides to leave and take control of her life, but tragically, Lloyd shoots her. Although her life ends prematurely, her emotional journey – moving from passive acceptance to a realization that she deserves more – is complete. The overarching theme of the play is the limitations and struggles associated with the lack of choice, highlighting the intense emotional journey Mae undergoes.
## Chapter 8 The emotional journey, a case study: Crash
**Summary**:

The text discusses the emotional journey of characters in storytelling and emphasizes that this journey shouldn't be straightforward. To sustain audience interest, the journey must have uncertainties, doubts, and backtracks. The emotional journey is not synonymous with the plot but is often influenced by it. Using the film "Crash" (written by Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco) as an example, the text describes how characters in multi-linear scripts interact and influence each other's emotional trajectories.

In "Crash", multiple storylines interweave around the theme of racial and ethnic conflicts in Los Angeles. The film focuses on the challenges of connection and touch in a segregated city. One prominent character, Anthony, starts as a small-time criminal justifying his actions through perceived racial discrimination. His journey evolves from bitterness to a selfless act, showing his desire to become an honorable man. Another character, Jean, lives in luxury but is always angry and isolated. Her emotional journey leads her to realize her isolation and reach out for connection.

The emotional journey is vital in character development, and in multi-linear scripts, it's the intertwining of these journeys that create a compelling narrative.
### Who he is and who he wants to be
**Summary:**

The text discusses the significance of the emotional journey a character undergoes in a story, emphasizing that it shouldn't be a straightforward progression. This journey is separate from the plot, but it's influenced by it. The emotional journey often involves the character's doubts about their transformation and choices, making it more compelling and engaging for the audience. A character's transformation isn't always positive; sometimes it's regressive, as seen in "Breaking Bad". The main point is that an obvious and direct transformation might not captivate the audience.

Using the film "Crash" as an example, the narrative explains how intertwined storylines, representing various characters' perspectives, make the story dynamic. In the movie, characters from different backgrounds interact in various situations, leading to misunderstandings primarily rooted in racial and ethnic differences. The story showcases how these misunderstandings and their inherent biases impact their emotional journeys and personal growth. Anthony, one character, begins as a bitter young man who justifies his criminal actions based on perceived racial discrimination. However, by the film's end, encounters with other characters make him reflect on his choices, leading him towards a more positive path.

Another character, Jean, lives a life of luxury but is constantly angry and isolated. After a series of events, she realizes her maid, Maria, is her best friend, indicating her loneliness. Jean's journey is about understanding her feelings and trying to move past them.

In essence, the text underscores the importance of emotional depth and transformation in character development, making a story more engaging for viewers.
## Chapter 9 Description and self-description 
**Summary:**

The text discusses the challenge of presenting a character to the audience once the writer has a clear understanding of that character and their story. While a writer might have a deep knowledge of their character, it's crucial to convey this to the audience effectively. The primary way to reveal a character's essence is through their actions, particularly their decisions in conflict situations. However, dialogues are also instrumental in character development. Aside from what the protagonist says, what other characters say about the protagonist can be a potent tool in character portrayal. The discussion emphasizes the significance of 'reporting of a character' as an essential technique in storytelling.
### Telling us what she's like
**Summary:**

People's perceptions of an individual, such as "Sandra", vary based on personal interactions and contexts. Asking different individuals to describe Sandra will yield varying opinions and descriptions. This phenomenon of differing perceptions is not only due to Sandra showing different sides of her personality in different contexts but also because each person evaluates her based on their own biases and experiences. Essentially, there isn't one 'real' Sandra but a multitude of interpretations of her. For playwrights and storytellers, this complexity in human perception is advantageous. By showcasing diverse opinions about a character, they can provide a more holistic and layered understanding of that character to the audience. Just as a single light can make an actor appear flat, a singular perspective can make a character seem one-dimensional. Multiple perspectives, like multiple lights, give depth and three-dimensionality. Thus, the views of various characters are crucial for representing a comprehensive and well-rounded character in stories.
### Preparing the ground
**Summary:**

The text discusses the importance of character establishment in storytelling. It emphasizes that audiences often understand a main character based on how secondary characters describe or relate to them. This indirect method can build anticipation and offers background information without direct exposition.

1. **Setting the Stage**: The storyteller can introduce a protagonist indirectly by having other characters discuss them before their formal introduction. Examples include Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" and "Coriolanus", where the characters are spoken of long before they make their actual appearance. This indirect introduction helps the audience shape a perception based on others' opinions.

2. **Description and Self-Description**: Characters can often be described both by others and by their own actions or lack thereof. For instance, in the radio play "Cigarettes and Chocolate", the protagonist, Gemma, is mainly known through the voices of others, which creates a picture of her character without her direct involvement. In other cases, characters might be shown doing something (e.g., Clint Eastwood's silent character in westerns) or might be misrepresented by others, as in "American Beauty". Sometimes, characters describe others in a way that reflects their own characteristics, like Mercutio does in "Romeo and Juliet".

3. **Showing vs Telling**: The writer has to decide between showing a character's traits through action or telling them via dialogues. Usually, showing is more powerful than telling, as actions can be more memorable and trustworthy than words. However, sometimes misleading the audience by telling can serve a narrative purpose.

4. **Impact of First Impressions**: Just like in real life, first impressions are vital in drama. They set the tone and establish initial perceptions that can evolve or be challenged as the story progresses.

Overall, establishing character is a nuanced task, and a balance of showing, telling, and the perceptions of other characters can create a richer narrative experience for the audience.
### Self-description 
**Summary**:

**Self-Description in Characterization**:

Self-description is a method used in various media like film, television, theatre, and radio where characters directly address the audience to reveal information about themselves or express it to another character. This technique can be effective but also comes with pitfalls.

In the mentioned extract from "Spend, Spend, Spend", Vivian's self-description isn't just to provide information but to show her understanding of her life. Self-descriptions, if just factual, risk being boring. They should contribute something additional to the story rather than merely restate known facts.

"American Beauty" is cited as an example where self-description works effectively. The protagonist, Lester Burnham, uses self-description to express his state of mind, intertwined with action. This approach provides context, leaves room for speculation, and conveys the character's state of mind. But self-description can also be misleading, as seen with Angela, who lies about her sexual experiences to appear more mature and worldly than she is.

The main risks with self-description are it becoming a lazy writing tool, being used redundantly, or misleadingly portraying a character.

**Stylistic Consistency**:

Different styles of writing are explored, from naturalism and heightened naturalism to non-naturalism which includes genres like fantasy and science fiction. Whatever style is chosen, maintaining stylistic consistency within a script is crucial. Audiences will accept any established rules if they are consistent.

Using the example from "When Harry Met Sally", the fake orgasm scene in the diner might seem unrealistic, but it is consistent with the heightened naturalism of the film. Characters can behave in slightly exaggerated ways, but as long as the emotional truth remains consistent, the audience is willing to suspend disbelief.

In essence, the article stresses the importance of effective self-description in character development and the significance of maintaining a consistent style in storytelling.
## Chapter 10 Heroes and villains
**Summary:**
The distinction between heroes and villains can be blurred, especially when characters are complex and undergo development. While clear heroes and villains can be found in stories like "Gladiator", with Maximus as the hero and Commodus as the villain, this delineation isn't as straightforward in other narratives. The character of Coriolanus is more ambiguous, and while he possesses heroic traits, he's also deeply flawed. "Game of Thrones" offers an even more intricate portrayal through Jaime Lannister, who transitions between villainous and heroic attributes throughout the series. It may be more accurate to use the terms 'protagonist' and 'antagonist' to describe central characters and their primary opposers, respectively. However, even these terms can be misleading, as seen in "Breaking Bad" where the morally flawed Walter White is the protagonist. It's essential to approach characters with nuance and avoid oversimplification.
### The strongest Character
**Summary:**
Protagonists in stories do not necessarily need to be morally good, but they should be the central characters who captivate the audience's interest. They undergo the most compelling struggles and emotional journeys, and the audience spends the most time with them, leading to an inherent identification with their perspectives. This identification can even occur with characters who have significant flaws, such as Coriolanus or Jonnie Rooster. A good example is the television series "The Bill", which deliberately frames the narrative from the police's point of view, making the audience identify with them. Even when a character has flaws, elements like humor or emotional vulnerability can lead to audience attachment. This concept is further explored through anti-heroes, like Walter White, who have a mix of good and bad qualities. Historically, characters like Ben Jonson's in "The Alchemist" and "Volpone" have charmed audiences despite their rogue behaviors. However, if a protagonist lacks any redeeming qualities, audience engagement can be limited. The key to a successful narrative is audience identification or empathy, as it drives interest and investment in the characters' fates.
### Antagonists
**Summary:**

The text discusses the nuances of creating compelling characters, focusing on antagonists and protagonists in storytelling.

1. **Antagonists**:
   - They don't necessarily need to elicit empathy but should be fascinating. A dull villain loses audience interest.
   - Their motivations should be clear, and their beliefs might be based on a personal moral code.
   - Edmund from "King Lear" exemplifies a villain with clear motivations stemming from the resentment of his illegitimate status.
   - The concept of free will versus environmental influence is essential in character development. A well-drawn character should show these aspects in balance.

2. **Heroes and Villains**:
   - Not all antagonists are villains. An antagonist simply opposes the protagonist's goals.
   - Examples like "Speed" show that the hero-villain dynamic isn't always about depth, but the motivations should be clear.
   - In plays like Sam Shepard’s "True West," both characters can act as protagonists and antagonists.

3. **Variety of Antagonists**:
   - There isn't always a single clear antagonist in every story.
   - The protagonist often faces multiple obstacles, sometimes even internal conflicts.
   - The idea of a central protagonist and antagonist can be too simplistic. Multiple characters might be on their personal journeys, and they could be both protagonists and antagonists to each other, as seen in "American Beauty."
   - Real scripts are multifaceted, and creating compelling characters involves acknowledging this complexity.
## Chapter 11 Secondary and minor characters 
**Summary**: 

Secondary and minor characters are crucial in storytelling. While they might not hold the spotlight like primary characters, they significantly shape the narrative by providing depth, perspective, and context. 

- Secondary characters should be carefully constructed, as they can greatly influence the story's credibility and overall impact.
- These characters can accentuate the themes of the narrative and offer insights into the main characters.
- In the film "Secrets and Lies", the secondary character Dionne highlights aspects of Hortense's character and her birth mother Cynthia, showcasing alternative choices Hortense could've made and revealing a more layered dimension of Cynthia.
- Similarly, in "Pretty Woman", characters like Kit de Luca, Philip Stuckey, and Mr. Thompson offer valuable contrasts and insights into the leads, Vivian and Edward. These secondary characters enhance the main characters' journeys by either showing alternatives, validating their choices, or revealing their evolution.
- Some characters might not directly impact the primary characters but contribute by painting the world of the story, like in "The Big Lebowski", where secondary characters establish an environment where eccentricity is the norm.
- Consistency in the portrayal of secondary characters is vital, as they reinforce the narrative's universe.
- While these characters have their role in the plot, it's essential that they remain distinctive and multidimensional since real individuals are diverse and unique.
## Chapter 12 The comic character 
**Summary**:

Comic characters can be both major and minor roles in a story. While adding comedic traits to a character can make them more relatable and appealing, it's essential to understand their placement in the narrative. For instance, if a primary character is inherently comedic, the story will lean towards comedy. However, introducing a comic minor character in a drama can add depth without turning the entire script comedic. It's challenging to mix an essentially comic central character in a serious drama without causing inconsistency in the story's tone.
### Comedy and naturalism 
**Summary**:

Comedy often deviates from naturalism, exaggerating reality to highlight underlying absurdity. However, there are exceptions where naturalism itself is comedic due to audience recognition of certain clichéd characters or phrases. While using clichés can elicit a smile, reinventing or playing with them can generate more profound humor, like the cabbie in "Shakespeare in Love." Another source of humor comes from recognizing traits of specific individuals in series, where repeated exposure to a character's quirks makes them funnier. For instance, in the TV series "Frasier," many jokes are based on understanding the characters deeply. Once familiar with the characters, lines or actions reflecting their typical behavior become inherently humorous to the audience.
### Humor tinged with sadness
**Summary**:

Many comic characters have an undertone of sadness, which can evoke both laughter and sympathy from the audience. Examples include Harold Steptoe from "Steptoe and Son" and Lady Would-be from Ben Jonson’s "Volpone". Delusions, especially about one's social standing or knowledge, are a frequent comedic tool. Comedy often plays with status relationships, emphasizing master-servant dynamics, as seen in "Fawlty Towers" and "Blackadder". Television sitcom characters generally don't evolve; they revert to their starting points at the end of episodes, with a few exceptions. Sitcoms like "Frasier" and "Detectorists" have shown character development across series. Series like "Green Wing" and "Catastrophe" have a mix of sketch and character-driven humor. A common comedic trope is the slightly dim but endearing character, seen in "Peep Show", "Friends", and "Blackadder". Ultimately, in many great comedies, characters don't intend to be funny; they become humorous due to the situations they are in, making it crucial for writers to craft scenarios that highlight their comedic attributes.
## Chapter 13 Leaving your characters 
**Summary:**

**Leaving Your Characters:**

1. **Improving Characters:** After all the work in creating a character, if they still don't feel right, then identify the problem. Common issues can be lack of conflict, unclear motivation, too much telling and not enough showing, or an unconvincing back-story. 
   
2. **Being Radical:** If small adjustments aren't working, consider significant changes. Change the character's gender, age, race, or background. This might help reveal the underlying issue or create a more compelling character.
   
3. **Reworking the Plot:** Sometimes the problem isn't the character but the plot itself. If the narrative doesn't allow for character growth, the solution might be in revising the story rather than the character.
   
4. **Importance of Final Impressions:** How a character is last seen or heard from can have a lasting impact on the audience. This can be done through symbolism, imagery, or a significant event. The ending should be memorable and reflect the essence of the character.

For instance, in "The Third Man", the last we see of Harry Lime are his fingertips trying to escape, symbolizing his ultimate descent and death. This powerful imagery becomes more significant than showing his actual death. The ending scene should encapsulate the essence of the character.
