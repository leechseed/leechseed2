## Chapter 1 Roots of a Character 
### Assignment: Character Creation Exploration

**Objective:** Develop a deeper understanding of character creation processes in scriptwriting, specifically focusing on the origins, personal connections, and the balance between nature, nurture, and present conditions.

**Tasks:**

1. **Character Origins:**
    - Choose a favorite film or play.
    - Identify the primary character and list down potential origins of this character. 
    - Do they remind you of someone from real life? Can you identify elements in them that seem drawn from multiple sources?

2. **Personal Connections:**
    - Think of someone you know well â€“ a family member, friend, or colleague.
    - Write a one-page character sketch based on this person. Ensure to detail their appearance, voice, history, and typical reactions to situations.
    - Modify the sketch to introduce two fictional elements: an unexpected background story and a hidden talent or secret.

3. **Autobiographical Insight:**
    - Reflect on a personal experience that had a significant emotional impact on you.
    - Write a brief scene, no longer than two pages, featuring "you" as a character in that situation.

4. **Mosaic of Traits:**
    - List down five distinct traits each from three different people you know. You should have a total of 15 traits.
    - Using these traits, craft a new character, blending these characteristics seamlessly. Describe this character in a brief character study.

        - Nature: Two inherent characteristics they were born with.
        - Nurture: Three experiences that shaped their personality or behavior.
        - Present: Describe their current disposition, appearance, and a recent life event.
    - Write a monologue for this character reflecting on one of their nurture experiences.
