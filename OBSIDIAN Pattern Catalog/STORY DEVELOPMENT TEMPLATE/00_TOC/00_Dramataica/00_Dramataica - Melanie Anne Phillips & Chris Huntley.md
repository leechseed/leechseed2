# Dramatica & the Creative Writer
The provided text is an excerpt from a book discussing the "Dramatica" theory of story, which divides the craft of writing into two main facets: structure and storytelling. Here is a summarized and clarified version of the text:

## Summary and Clarification

#### **Introduction to Dramatica**

The book proposes to guide readers in mastering the art of writing through the Dramatica theory, which examines both structure and style in the craft of storytelling. This approach seeks to educate rather than inspire, allowing a deeper exploration into each aspect of writing which are traditionally blended in the creative process. It emphasizes that effective communication is a crucial aspect of this process, necessitating clear transmission of information or feelings from the author (originator) to the audience (recipient).

#### **Audience Participation in Storytelling**

The audience is an active participant in storytelling, often creating additional layers of meaning from the narrative based on their personal experiences and interpretations. The narrative doesn't have to contain explicit details, as a simple phrase can evoke a rich tapestry of memories and emotions in the audience, creating a subjective experience.

#### **Grand Argument Stories**

The text introduces the concept of the "Grand Argument Story," which is defined as a comprehensive narrative that presents a complete argument, encompassing all possible perspectives on an issue while highlighting one approach as the optimal solution. This is not meant to diminish other forms of storytelling but to delineate this specific category. The Grand Argument Story is analyzed through various elements including structure, dynamics, character, theme, plot, and genre. These elements, described in detail, interlink to form a "Storyform", a blueprint that reveals the intricate relationships and arrangements that create a cohesive narrative.

#### **Free-form Authoring and Scope of Dramatica**

While some authors adhere to structured storytelling to present a comprehensive argument, others indulge in free-form writing to explore personal experiences or insights, sometimes without a clear intent. The Dramatica theory, although focused on the Grand Argument Story, can encompass other forms of communication since it illustrates all possible ways to examine an issue, encompassing various "slices" or "chunks" of the model. This theory holds that universally shared essential concepts, albeit interpreted differently across cultures and individuals, facilitate communication.

#### **Symbolization and Communication**

The process of communication entails the symbolization of concepts, translating them into words or actions that may become culturally specific and subject to diverse interpretations. This also highlights the challenge of conveying the author's intent accurately, as the symbols used may invoke different reactions based on the cultural background of the audience.

#### **Author's Intent and Use of Dramatica**

Being an author involves the intention to communicate. However, authors often struggle to integrate their individual inspirations into a unified story, either resulting in formulaic works or chaotic narratives. Dramatica serves as a tool to guide authors in shaping their narrative, helping identify the elements that align with their story's intent and those that don't. It can be used at different stages of the writing process, aiding both structured and free-form authors in honing their craft. It also assists in understanding the impact of diverging from traditional storytelling structures on audience reception.

#### **Book Structure and Application of Dramatica**

The book is divided into two major sections that delve into the components of a story (Character, Theme, Plot, and Genre) and the stages of communication between the author and the audience (Storyforming, Storyencoding, Storyweaving, and Reception). It aims to equip readers with a comprehensive understanding of storytelling and tools to enhance their writing skills. The authors note their background in the motion picture industry and clarify that Dramatica is a universal theory of story, not restricted to any specific medium.

#### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, Dramatica serves as a valuable tool for authors, offering insights into the process of communication and storytelling, whether they choose to adhere to structured narratives or explore a more free-form approach. It allows for a deeper understanding of the intricacies of story development and the role of audience interpretation in the storytelling process.
# Section 1: The Elements of Structure

## Foundations
The excerpt outlines the central concepts of Dramatica, a theory of story development. Here is a clarification and summarization of the concepts and ideas presented:

### Clarification:

1. **The Story Mind**:
   - **Concept**: Every complete story mimics the mind's problem-solving process. 
   - **Function**: Presents a holistic approach to understanding and addressing issues, wherein various conflicting perspectives are brought together to give a story its meaning. 

2. **The Four Throughlines**:
   - **Concept**: These are perspectives or lenses through which a story is viewed to give a comprehensive understanding of the problem at the center of the story. 
   - **Function**: Helps in presenting a well-rounded argument, guiding the audience not only on what to observe but also how to perceive it, establishing a connection between the object and the observer.

3. **Individual Throughlines**:
   - **Overall Story Throughline**: A detached view of the story, focusing on unfolding strategies and larger events, often associated with the plot.
   - **Main Character Throughline**: A more personal perspective, where audiences empathize with the main character and experience events at a close range.
   - **Impact Character Throughline**: Illustrates the presence of a character who brings a different approach to the problem, impacting the main character's path.
   - **Subjective Story Throughline**: Depicts the intense interaction and conflict between the main and the impact characters.
   
4. **Grand Argument Story**:
   - **Concept**: A comprehensive narrative developed by integrating all four throughlines, thereby crafting an argument that explores all facets of the central problem.
   - **Function**: Offers a multifaceted reflection of human cognition in problem-solving, showcasing the dynamics between reason, emotion, immediate advantages, and experiences.
   
5. **Other Aspects**:
   - **Characters, Plot, Theme, and Genre**: These elements are tangible manifestations of various considerations in the Story Mind. 
      - **Characters**: Represent motivations that may conflict with each other.
      - **Plot**: Illustrates the problem-solving methods used.
      - **Theme**: Examines the relative values and standards.
      - **Genre**: Establishes the overall attitude or background tone.

### Summary:

Dramatica is a story theory that proposes a comprehensive approach to understanding and crafting narratives. It introduces the concept of the "Story Mind", a representation of a mind engaging in problem-solving, which is developed through various tangible aspects like characters, plot, theme, and genre. The theory emphasizes four perspectives, termed as throughlines: Overall, Main Character, Impact Character, and Subjective Story Throughlines, each offering different viewpoints on the central problem.

Through these throughlines, the author creates a grand argument, which serves as an exploration of various facets of the central issue, providing a rich and multifaceted narrative that engages the audience holistically. Examples from well-known stories like "Star Wars" and "To Kill A Mockingbird" illustrate these concepts in action, demonstrating the interplay between various characters and narrative threads to build a complex, complete story.

As you move forward, these concepts will serve as foundational elements in your exploration of Dramatica's Theory of Story, enriching your understanding and capabilities in story crafting.


## Character
### Introduction to Character

**Clarification**:

In this passage, the writer discusses the different types of central characters in a story - the Main Character, the Protagonist, and the Hero - as defined by the Dramatica theory of story. 

1. **Main Character**: The individual through whom the audience personally experiences the story.
2. **Protagonist**: The person who drives the story's plot forward.
3. **Hero**: A character that embodies both the qualities of the Main Character and the Protagonist, serving as a point of connection for the audience and advancing the story's plot.

The text also introduces the concept of the "Story Mind", which is perceived in two views: the Overall Story view and the Subjective view. The Overall Story view is an outsider's perspective where characters are identified by their roles in the plot. In contrast, the Subjective view embodies the internal conflict within the story, primarily illustrated through the interactions of Main and Impact characters. These different views help in creating rich, complex narratives and more realistic characters. The subsequent chapters seem to promise a deeper analysis of these concepts.

**Summary**:

The excerpt presents an introduction to character development in storytelling, emphasizing the distinction between a Main Character, a Protagonist, and a Hero as delineated by Dramatica theory. It highlights the limited scope of considering the central character as merely a hero and promotes the separation of the roles of Main Character and Protagonist for a nuanced narrative, as illustrated with the example from "To Kill a Mockingbird". Moreover, it introduces the concept of "Story Mind", proposing two views - Overall Story and Subjective - that offer different perspectives in story analysis: one focusing on the external functions of characters and the other representing the internal viewpoints and conflicts within a narrative. The passage indicates that upcoming sections will delve deeper into understanding these concepts, exploring the functionalities of different character archetypes and how they influence story development.
### Overall Story Characters
#### Clarification and Summary:

**Introduction to Archetypes**

Archetypes are a kind of shorthand in storytelling that authors use to quickly convey character traits and roles in a story. They may be used to save time, emphasize other story elements, or leverage audience familiarity with certain character types. Archetypes can be both advantageous due to their simplicity and disadvantageous if they are not sufficiently developed. There are eight archetypal characters outlined: Protagonist, Antagonist, Reason, Emotion, Sidekick, Skeptic, Guardian, and Contagonist.

**Players and Characters**

In the Dramatica theory, a character is defined as a set of dramatic functions necessary to make a complete argument in a story, while a player represents these functions, often embodying multiple characters, akin to multiple personalities in one entity. This phenomenon can be observed in characters like Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.

**Character Descriptions**

1. **Protagonist**: The central figure driving the effort to achieve the story's goal. They are usually paired with the Main Character role, making their depiction richer in the narrative.
   
2. **Antagonist**: The force opposing the protagonist's goal. They may also embody the Impact Character, representing an alternate belief system in the subjective story, challenging the Main Character's approach to their personal problem.
   
3. **Reason**: This character operates based on logic and rational decisions, sometimes at the expense of ignoring personal emotions and considerations.
   
4. **Emotion**: A character driven by feelings, often exhibiting frenetic and disorganized behavior, representing the heart in the intellectual versus emotional deliberation in the story's mind.
   
5. **Sidekick**: A loyal supporter, usually of the protagonist, representing faith and support in the story's narrative.
   
6. **Skeptic**: A doubter who opposes the sidekick's faith and support, portraying doubts and potential failure indicators in the story.
   
7. **Guardian**: A helper or teacher character embodying the conscience, helping guide the protagonist towards success.
   
8. **Contagonist**: A unique archetype in Dramatica that serves to hinder the protagonist's progress, either by delaying or diverting them, representing temptation in the story's mind.

These archetypes function together to form a balanced and complete argument in a story, providing different perspectives and dimensions to the narrative. They can be aligned in different ways to add complexity and depth to their relationships.

### Complex Characters
**Summary:**

The text discusses the concepts of archetypal and complex characters in storytelling. Archetypal characters embody cohesive, harmonious traits, making them predictable and possibly less human-like. On the other hand, complex characters exhibit more nuanced, conflicting traits, offering deeper exploration and resembling real humans more closely. Characters are defined by their functions or elements which can be combined in various ways to create either archetypal or complex characters.

The text also introduces the idea of "Dynamic Pairs", which are pairs of archetypal characters representing different facets of the human mind grappling with a problem. These pairs embody conflicts such as desire versus avoidance, reason versus emotion, and faith versus disbelief. In a story, characters can be categorized as "Drivers" or "Passengers", where drivers are primary forces moving the plot forward, and passengers represent different approaches and attitudes towards the problem without directly driving the plot. Examples of drivers are the protagonist, antagonist, guardian, and contagonist, and examples of passengers are the sidekick, reason, emotion, and skeptic.

---

**Clarification:**

1. **Complex Characters**: These characters have traits and functions that are not internally compatible, making them more layered and resembling real humans closely as they embody our inconsistencies. 
   
2. **Archetypal Characters**: These characters group together similar and compatible functions, which means they don't have internal conflicts in their nature. They are easier to understand but might appear less developed compared to complex characters.

3. **Dynamic Pairs**: These are pairs of archetypal characters that represent different aspects of the human mindset when addressing a problem. The pairs embody opposing traits or approaches and signify the internal conflict a mind experiences while facing a problem.

4. **Drivers and Passengers**: In a story, characters can be classified as drivers or passengers. "Drivers" are the primary forces that propel the plot forward, actively influencing the outcomes. "Passengers", on the other hand, influence the drivers and represent various approaches or attitudes towards the problem but do not directly impact the progression of the plot.

5. **Character Elements**: These are the fundamental building blocks of a character, defining their role and nature in a story. Understanding these elements helps in developing characters that can either be archetypal or complex, depending on how these elements are combined and portrayed.

### Drivers and Passengers in "Star Wars," "The Wizard of Oz," & "Jaws"

In this text, the concept of "Drivers" and "Passengers" in the context of storytelling is discussed using examples from popular movies like "Star Wars," "The Wizard of Oz," and "Jaws." Here is a summarized and clarified version of the information:

#### Overview

In storytelling, characters can be classified into two primary groups: Drivers and Passengers. These classifications help in understanding the characters' roles and their impact on the progression of the story.

- **Drivers**: These are characters who are the prime movers in the story, significantly influencing the course of events.
- **Passengers**: These characters, on the other hand, are more reactive and represent different approaches and attitudes towards the central problem of the story, but do not primarily drive the story forward.

#### Examples:

1. #### **Star Wars**
    - **Driver Characters**:
        - **Protagonist (Luke Skywalker)**: The central figure driving the goal of the story.
        - **Antagonist (The Empire)**: Opposes the goal of destroying the Death Star.
        - **Guardian (Obi-Wan Kenobi)**: Provides protection and moral guidance.
        - **Contagonist (Darth Vader)**: Represents temptation and hinders progress.
    - **Passenger Characters**:
        - **Sidekick (R2D2 and C3PO)**: Faithful supporters.
        - **Reason (Princess Leia)**: The logical and planner figure.
        - **Emotion (Chewbacca)**: Acts based on feelings.
        - **Skeptic (Han Solo)**: Continually questions and opposes actions proposed by others.

    - **Driver Characters**:
        - **Protagonist (Dorothy)**: Main character embarking on a journey.
        - **Antagonist (Wicked Witch)**: Opposes Dorothy, although not perfectly fitting the archetype.
        - **Guardian (Glinda)**: Offers guidance and protection.
        - **Contagonist (Wizard)**: A controversial figure, with ambiguous moral positioning.
    - **Passenger Characters**:
        - **Sidekick (Toto)**: Loyal companion to Dorothy.
        - **Reason (Scarecrow)**: Acts as a planner, albeit not calmly.
        - **Emotion (Tin Man)**: Displays emotional responses, though not frenzied.
        - **Skeptic (Cowardly Lion)**: Shows doubt and fear.
![[Pasted image 20230908033120.png]]
3. #### **Jaws**
    - **Driver Characters**:
        - **Protagonist (Chief Brody)**: Main character attempting to address the shark problem.
        - **Antagonist (Shark)**: The force opposing Brody's efforts.
        - **Guardian/Reason (Hooper)**: Provides moral guidance and adopts a rational approach, playing a dual role.
        - **Contagonist/Skeptic (Mayor)**: Hinders progress and expresses doubt, also playing a dual role.
    - **Passenger Characters**:
        - **Sidekick (Brody's Wife)**: A secondary character providing support.
        - **Emotion (Quint)**: Acts based on intense feelings towards sharks.
![[Pasted image 20230908033130.png]]
### Insights:

- Characters in a story may not always fit perfectly into archetypal molds, and can exhibit characteristics of complex characters, demonstrating more nuanced behaviors and motivations.
- Identifying and analyzing these roles can provide deeper insights into the dynamics of a story and the complexities of the characters involved.
- The process helps in understanding how different characters contribute to the overall narrative and the conflicts that drive the story forward.

### Action and Decision Elements of Drivers and Passengers
The text elaborates on archetypal characters typically found in narratives, further dissecting these archetypes into elements pertaining to their actions and decisions, which helps in analyzing characters in movies like The Wizard of Oz and Jaws. 

Initially, a brief recap is given, outlining eight primary archetypal characters as follows:

1. **Protagonist**: The main driver of the story who forces the action and seeks success.
2. **Antagonist**: The character opposing the protagonist, representing the primary obstacle to the protagonist's success.
3. **Reason**: A character who operates based on logic and rationality, devoid of emotional influence.
4. **Emotion**: A character who acts on feelings without considering practical implications.
5. **Skeptic**: This character doubts everything, including plans, sincerity, and truth.
6. **Sidekick**: A character that remains loyally supportive, often aligned with the protagonist or antagonist.
7. **Guardian**: A helper or teacher who aids the protagonist and embodies a moral standard.
8. **Contagonist**: A character who obstructs the protagonist, tempting them to choose the wrong path.

Subsequently, these archetypes are split into action and decision characteristics to provide a more nuanced analysis:

1. **Protagonist**
   - Action: Pursues the goal actively.
   - Decision: Encourages others to realize the necessity of the goal.

2. **Antagonist**
   - Action: Physically tries to hinder the protagonist's success.
   - Decision: Encourages others to rethink the attempt to achieve the goal.

3. **Guardian**
   - Action: Aids in achieving the story goal.
   - Decision: Represents moral conscience.

4. **Contagonist**
   - Action: Hinders efforts to achieve the story goal.
   - Decision: Represents the temptation to choose the incorrect approach.

5. **Reason**
   - Action: Has controlled actions.
   - Decision: Makes decisions based on logic.

6. **Emotion**
   - Action: Has frenzied or uncontrolled actions.
   - Decision: Makes decisions based on feelings, disregarding practicality.

7. **Sidekick**
   - Action: Supports and cheers on.
   - Decision: Has an almost gullible faith in the goal or protagonist.

8. **Skeptic**
   - Action: Opposes everything.
   - Decision: Doubts everything.

Further, these split characteristics are organized into quadrants — Driver and Passenger Quads — which give a visual representation of the motivations driving these archetypal characters. In Dramatica theory, these 16 characteristics are referred to as the "Motivation Elements," illustrating what propels the archetypal characters in a story.

![[Pasted image 20230908033339.png]]

### The 16 Motivation Elements in "Star Wars," "The Wizard of Oz," & "Jaws"
This long passage discusses a framework to analyze the depth and complexity of characters in narratives, particularly focusing on the sixteen motivation elements that drive characters and their decisions and actions.

#### Clarification and Summary

##### Summary:

The text breaks down characters into various archetypes based on their roles, actions, and decisions in the storyline. These archetypes can further be split into two characteristics: action and decision. These characteristics can be used to analyze the complexity of characters in well-known stories such as Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz, and Jaws. The sixteen motivation elements offer a tool to dissect character complexities further than the basic archetypal categorization, allowing for the analysis of their inner conflicts and deeper motivations.

##### Clarification:

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the information provided in the text:

1. **Archetypal Characters and Their Roles**:
    - Protagonist: Drives the story forward, encouraging others to prioritize the goal.
    - Antagonist: Opposes the protagonist, trying to prevent the goal from being achieved.
    - Guardian: Aids the protagonist, representing moral standards based on the author's viewpoint.
    - Contagonist: Hinders the protagonist, tempting them to stray from the right path.
    - Reason: Makes decisions based on logic, with a controlled approach to actions.
    - Emotion: Makes decisions based on feelings, with an uncontrolled approach to actions.
    - Sidekick: Supports the protagonist faithfully, showing extreme faith in the goal or protagonist.
    - Skeptic: Doubts everything, opposing actions and beliefs constantly.

2. **Analysis of Classic Movies**:
    - **Star Wars**: The characteristics of the archetypes are well aligned with the roles of characters like Luke (Protagonist), Obi-Wan (Guardian), Darth Vader (Contagonist), and others.
![[Pasted image 20230908033844.png]]
    - **The Wizard of Oz**: The character analysis indicates a swap in the characteristics of some archetypes (like the Tin Man and Scarecrow) creating complex, conflicted characters. The Witch and the Wizard also display swapped elements, diverging from traditional archetypes.
![[Pasted image 20230908033919.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230908033935.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230908034013.png]]
    - **Jaws**: The character roles and characteristics align well with the proposed archetypes, with characters like Brody fitting the protagonist role perfectly.
![[Pasted image 20230908034033.png]]
3. **Grouping the 16 Motivation Elements**:
    - The sixteen elements can be grouped into four quads based on whether they pertain to action or decision, and whether they are driver or passenger elements.
    - The grouping of these elements in quads helps to deepen the understanding of character motivations and their relationships.

4. **Using the Quads to Gain Meaning**:
    - The framework can be used to create complex characters by assigning elements in non-traditional patterns, enabling the creation of rich and sophisticated characters in stories.
    - Characters are multi-dimensional, influenced by motivations, purposes, methodologies, and evaluation means. The discussion hints at exploring more complex arrangements of character elements in subsequent sections.

This framework provides a method for dissecting character complexities, offering a comprehensive lens to analyze and understand the motivations and roles of characters in narratives.
### The 16 Motivation Elements in "The Wizard of Oz" & "Jaws"
This text explores the complex characterization found in "The Wizard of Oz" and "Jaws" through the lens of the Dramatica theory, a theory that breaks down characters into a set of motivation elements, helping to create multi-faceted, nuanced characters.

In the section discussing "The Wizard of Oz", the main characters are analyzed based on a set of motivation elements, where it notes a departure from archetypal roles. The Scarecrow and Tin Man, in particular, demonstrate complex characteristics; Scarecrow combines logic with an uncontrolled approach, whereas the Tin Man pairs feelings with control, creating an interesting internal conflict in each of these characters. This depth adds a level of complexity to their personas. The Witch and the Wizard, meanwhile, diverge from the traditional Archetypal molds, undergoing a different kind of "swapping" of elements that add layers to their characters. In the Quad formation, not all characters adhere strictly to the archetypal roles, showing a richer characterization.
![[Pasted image 20230909203028.png]]
In the "Jaws" segment, characters are also dissected based on these motivational elements. Brody, the protagonist, embodies the attributes of "pursue" and "consideration", actively working towards achieving his goal. Other characters, like Hooper and the Mayor, exhibit different combinations of elements, adding depth to their roles within the story. Hooper, for example, embodies a role of conscience and logic, but with an uncontrolled approach, making his character more intricate and possibly unpredictable.
![[Pasted image 20230909203035.png]]
Overall, the sections of the text explore how utilizing a combination of different motivational elements can create more complex and nuanced characters in storytelling, diverging from simple archetypal roles to create characters with depth and internal conflict, making for a richer narrative experience. It's a part of the broader approach of the Dramatica theory, aiming to understand and craft stories with intricate character developments and relationships.
### Grouping the 16 Motivation Elements
In the provided text, the Dramatica theory of story is discussed, emphasizing a more nuanced approach to organizing character elements beyond the traditional eight archetypal character types. This evolved approach breaks down character traits into 16 separate motivation elements, grouped into four quads: Action Driver Quad, Decision Driver Quad, Action Passenger Quad, and Decision Passenger Quad. Each of these quads comprises four characteristics, allowing for a more detailed and granulated analysis of character motivations and actions.

The text further explains how utilizing these quads can offer deeper insight into character relationships and dynamics. By examining characters through the lens of these quads, it helps in understanding the distinct roles and functions of different characters, such as the protagonist and the guardian, in a story. This approach provides a framework to understand how different characters, with specific drives like 'Pursue' or 'Help', interact and relate to each other, facilitating the crafting of complex narratives.

Furthermore, the text hints at the limitation of solely using these 16 motivation elements to develop characters as it only represents one dimension of character complexity, specifically the "Motivation" dimension. Characters in sophisticated stories, similar to real people, are also influenced by their purposes, the methodologies they employ to achieve those purposes, and the means they use to evaluate their efforts, forming a four-dimensional character model. The subsequent sections of the text are anticipated to delve into how to effectively rearrange these motivation elements and introduce other dimensions of character complexity to craft fully realized, four-dimensional characters.

![[Pasted image 20230909203252.png]]
### "Star Wars," "Oz," & "Jaws" Characters in Four Motivation Quads

In this excerpt, the Dramatica theory of story is applied to character analysis in the "Star Wars", "The Wizard of Oz", and "Jaws" narratives, by categorizing characters into four motivation quads: Action Driver Quad, Decision Driver Quad, Action Passenger Quad, and Decision Passenger Quad.

In the "Star Wars" example, the characters perfectly fit into these quads, displaying a symmetrical pattern. Each character possesses both an Action and a Decision characteristic, creating direct oppositions between pairs of characters both internally and externally. These characterizations are seen to fall strictly within either the Driver or the Passenger quads, maintaining a neat alignment with traditional archetypes.
![[Pasted image 20230909203314.png]]
Meanwhile, the characters in "The Wizard of Oz" display a notable variation from the standard archetype through the "flipping" of Logic and Feeling in relation to Control and Uncontrolled characteristics. This adjustment generates characters with conflicting attributes, resulting in more complex and versatile personalities. Specifically, the Wizard and the Wicked Witch's characters deviate from the typical molds, showcasing more depth and less stereotypical traits, which influence the narrative dynamics and audience expectations significantly.
![[Pasted image 20230909203308.png]]
Lastly, in the "Jaws" analysis, the character setups in the Driver quad mirror those found in "Star Wars", with simple and straightforward characteristics. However, an interesting phenomenon is observed in the Passenger quad, where certain characters (like the Mayor and Hooper) embody multiple characteristics, spanning both Driver and Passenger traits. This complex configuration results in these characters having more intricate interactions and conflicts compared to archetypal characters, categorizing them as "Complex Characters".
![[Pasted image 20230909203321.png]]
In essence, the passage explores how restructuring character elements, by employing the four motivation quads, can create multi-layered characters that not only add depth to the narrative but also foster more intricate and engaging story developments.

### Complex Motivation Characteristics
In this excerpt from the Dramatica theory of story, the discussion revolves around the rules and nuances of combining different characteristics to create complex and nuanced characters in a story.

Initially, the rule highlighted is that a character should not embody both characteristics in a Dynamic Pair simultaneously as it contradicts the principle of the "Story Mind" analogy, illustrating the logical inconsistency of being both for and against something at the same time. However, it also introduces the concept of a "player" who can portray multiple characters (each with different characteristics) but only one at a time, essentially switching roles as required. This method allows for a wide range of characteristics to be exhibited by a single entity, as long as they don't represent opposing traits concurrently.

Furthermore, the theory accepts the inclusion of conflicting characteristics within one entity, as seen in the case of characters with split personalities, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In such scenarios, a player can choose a diverse set of characteristics but must avoid selecting opposing elements from a Dynamic Pair to maintain coherence and avoid internal conflict.

Looking at character growth, the excerpt distinguishes between the objective and subjective aspects of characters. Objectively, characters embody fixed problem-solving processes and remain consistent in their innate dispositions throughout the story. Subjectively, they can exhibit growth as their perspectives and learned behaviors evolve over the course of the narrative. 

For authors, this theory underscores the importance of thoughtful distribution of the 16 motivations among characters to craft a cohesive and compelling story. It warns against the repetition of characteristics, which can muddle the storyline, and the omission of characteristics, which can create gaps in the story's argument. Despite these guidelines, the theory encourages authors to exploit the flexibility within these rules to create unique and engaging characters that fulfill the audience's expectations of a well-rounded story mind. It suggests a balanced approach, where authors can construct unique and memorable characters while adhering to the logical and comprehensive representation of motivations within the story mind framework.

### Complex Characters in "Gone With the Wind," & "Rear Window"

This text discusses the analysis of characters and their motivations in two famous works, "Gone with the Wind" and "Rear Window", based on the theory posited in the book "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" by Screenplay Systems Inc. 

##### Gone with the Wind

###### Overview
The analysis starts by mentioning the depth of the plot in "Gone with the Wind" and indicates that the character complexity is comparable to other stories discussed before. The characters are analyzed based on their motivations and characteristics.

###### Main Characters and Characteristics
- **Scarlett O'Hara:** Characterized as "PURSUE" and "CONSIDERATION" due to her persistent nature in pursuing various objectives and making others reconsider their standpoints.
- **Rhett Butler:** Identified as "AVOID" and "RECONSIDERATION" since he mostly steers clear of getting involved directly and tends to make others rethink their actions.
- **Ashley Wilkes:** Defined as representing "TEMPTATION" and "HINDER", embodying temptation for Scarlett, even though indirectly, and often jeopardizes Scarlett's situations.
- **Melanie Wilkes:** She embodies "CONSCIENCE" and "HELP", often advising Scarlett and fixing the problems created by her.

##### Character Pairings
The text emphasizes the thoughtful pairings of characters, who complement or oppose each other in terms of their characteristics, creating a rich narrative dynamics.

##### Rear Window

###### Overview
The analysis transitions to discussing the more complex characters of "Rear Window", a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It narrows down the important characters to five: Jeffries, Lisa, Doyle, the Nurse, and Thorwald.

###### Main Characters and Characteristics
- **Jeffries:** His characteristics are "FAITH", "CONSIDERATION", "UNCONTROLLED", and "PURSUE". He believes in the occurrence of a murder and urges others to consider the possibility despite lacking logical arguments.
- **Lisa:** Represents "TEMPTATION", "SUPPORT", and "FEELING". She supports Jeffries but acts impulsively and sometimes hinders his efforts.
- **Doyle:** Characterized by "DISBELIEF" and "LOGIC", he dismisses Jeffries' suspicions, demanding logical explanations for them.
- **Nurse:** Portrays "CONSCIENCE" and "OPPOSE", providing a moral compass and opposing Jeffries' endeavours.
- **Thorwald:** His traits are "RECONSIDERATION", "CONTROL", and "AVOID". His actions encourage reconsideration of beliefs, and he prefers to avoid confrontation.

### Other Character Dimensions

This text discusses a theory of character development from the work "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" where characters in storytelling are considered to have four critical dimensions that define them: Motivation, Methodology, Evaluation, and Purpose. Let's break down each section to clarify and summarize the presented information:

#### Other Character Dimensions What's the Purpose?

##### Summary:
In this section, the difference between a character's purpose and motivation is explained. The purpose refers to the goal that the character wants to achieve, while motivation represents the underlying reason driving them towards that purpose. Understanding both aspects helps in creating a richer character profile as different motivations can lead to different purposes.

##### Clarification:
- Purpose: The objective or goal of the character (e.g., Jane wants to become president).
- Motivation: The underlying drive behind the character's actions or goals (e.g., Jane's childhood lack of control or a desire for an equal rights amendment).

#### Step into the Fourth Dimension....

##### Summary:
This section introduces the Dramatica theory of a character being four-dimensional rather than three-dimensional. Beyond motivation and purpose, a character also needs a methodology, defining the approach they use to achieve their goal, and an evaluation dimension, which refers to the standards they use to measure their progress.

##### Clarification:
- Methodology: The strategies or approaches a character employs to realize their purpose.
- Evaluation: The parameters or standards a character utilizes to assess their progress towards their purpose.

#### All right, Buddy... Where's the conflict?!

##### Summary:
This section exemplifies how conflict can arise between characters even when they share motivations, methodologies, and purposes, but differ in the evaluation dimension. Different evaluation criteria can lead to disagreements and conflicts, making the character interactions more complex and realistic.

##### Clarification:
- Conflict can arise from differing evaluations, despite agreement in other dimensions.
- Characters might have different standards of measuring success, leading to conflicts.

#### The Sixty-Four Element Question
![[Pasted image 20230909203819.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230909203832.png]]
##### Summary:
In this part, the concept of character dimensions is expanded to include a complex system called the "Chess Set," which comprises 64 elements spread across four sets representing each dimension: Purpose, Evaluation, Motivation, and Methodology. These elements further define the nuances in each dimension, providing a detailed framework for character development.

#### Clarification:
- The "Chess Set" is a comprehensive grid containing 64 elements that further detail the four main character dimensions.
- Each set consists of 16 elements that contribute to creating well-rounded characters.

#### Archetypal Characters

##### Summary:
This section hints at the possibility of mapping archetypal characters onto the character elements within the "Chess Set," potentially revealing patterns or archetypes that can be utilized in character creation and development.

##### Clarification:
- The "archetypal pattern" refers to the identifiable traits that can be found when mapping archetypal characters onto the grid of character elements.
- Utilizing the archetypal patterns can provide a structured approach to character creation, taking into account all 64 elements in the "Chess Set." 

I hope this breakdown helps clarify and summarize the complex theory presented in the text!
### Mapping the Archetypal Pattern

In this excerpt from "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story", the authors delve deeply into the intricate process of crafting well-rounded characters in storytelling. Here's a summary and clarification of the texts:

#### Summary:

##### Character Dimensions and Their Importance:
Characters in a story are developed through different dimensions including motivations, purposes, methodologies, and evaluations. Motivation is what drives the character, whereas purpose is what they aim to achieve. Methodology denotes the approaches a character employs to reach their goals, and evaluations are the standards they use to gauge their progress. These dimensions help in adding depth and realism to the characters.

##### Conflict Between Characters:
Conflict can arise between characters even if they agree on several dimensions. The conflict might stem from differences in their evaluations of a situation, as depicted through the example of two business partners with divergent standards for evaluating business success.

##### The Chess Set:
Character dimensions contain sixteen elements each, collectively forming a "Chess Set", a grid that helps to visualize and understand various aspects of character development such as purpose, evaluations, motivations, etc.

![[Pasted image 20230909204141.png]]
##### Archetypal and Complex Dimensional Patterns:
An archetypal pattern is mapped in the motivation set where characters represent opposite motivations, forming dynamic pairs which represent the potential for greatest conflict. The same pattern applies to methodology sets as well. Complex characters may deviate from these archetypal patterns, adopting elements from various dimensions, thus adding versatility to their personalities.

##### Relationships and Conflicts Among Character Elements:
Character elements can have various relationships including dynamic pairs (exact opposites creating potential conflict), companion pairs (compatible yet may have negative impacts), and dependent pairs (complementing each other’s strengths or creating codependency). These relationships offer varied ways to craft conflict and camaraderie between characters. Understanding these relationships is vital in crafting nuanced and layered stories.
![[Pasted image 20230909204155.png]]
#### Clarification:

The text provides a detailed theory on developing complex, well-rounded characters in a story by focusing on four key dimensions: motivation, purpose, methodology, and evaluation. It emphasizes that understanding and utilizing these dimensions can allow for a richer narrative with deep, complex characters. It introduces the concept of the "Chess Set", a tool to map out and understand these dimensions and their various components better. 

Moreover, it emphasizes the significance of crafting relationships between characters judiciously, illustrating how different types of pairs (dynamic, companion, dependent) can create varied dynamics and conflicts in a story. Lastly, it suggests that writers can venture beyond typical archetypes to create characters with multifaceted personalities, thereby offering more depth and complexity to their narratives.
### Subjective Characters

**SUMMARY AND CLARIFICATION**

*Dramatica* introduces a comprehensive theory of character development in storytelling. Here's a breakdown of the core concepts:

1. **Character Dimensions**: Dramatica believes that characters need to be fleshed out across four dimensions to appear fully realized.
    * **Motivation**: Why a character takes action. It's the force that propels them.
    * **Purpose**: The goal or endpoint the character is driven towards.
    * **Methodology**: The approach or tactics a character employs to achieve their purpose.
    * **Evaluation**: The standards or measures a character uses to assess their progress.

2. **Difference between Purpose and Motivation**: Purpose is what the character aims to achieve, while Motivation is the underlying reason why they want to achieve it. For instance, wanting to be president is a Purpose, but the reason behind that aspiration is the Motivation.

3. **The Archetypal Pattern**: 
    * Characters have consistent patterns in their motivations, which can be mapped. Elements diagonally opposite each other are in direct conflict, creating dynamic pairs (e.g., Pursuit and Avoid). 
    * The patterns are consistent across other character dimensions too. For example, a Protagonist driven by 'Pursuit' might use 'Pro-action' as a methodology.

4. **Dynamic, Companion, and Dependent Pairs**: These terms describe relationships between elements and, consequently, characters.
    * **Dynamic Pairs** have elements in opposition, creating conflict.
    * **Companion Pairs** contain elements that are compatible but can either benefit or hinder each other.
    * **Dependent Pairs** are complementary, where each character can bolster the other's weaknesses or become co-dependent.
    * **Components** look at characters in relation to the overall group, focusing either on their individuality or their group identity.

5. **Complex Characters**: While archetypes offer a starting point, characters can be developed more deeply by mixing and matching elements from different dimensions. This creates multifaceted characters that can simultaneously exhibit traits from various archetypes.

6. **In Summary**: Dramatica presents a matrix-like approach to character development, viewing characters across four dimensions and understanding them based on their motivations, purposes, methodologies, and evaluations. By strategically pairing and positioning these elements, writers can craft richer, multi-dimensional characters.
### Deep Theory 
This lengthy passage delves into the mechanics of story-telling and character development, focusing heavily on the journey of a main character and the challenges they encounter in the narrative. The central theme revolves around the concepts of problem-solving and justification, examining how characters navigate their issues and the theoretical underpinnings behind their actions. Below is a more detailed summary and clarification of each section:

#### Deep Theory
This introductory section mentions that the ensuing discussion will explore complex theoretical details about the character development in a narrative. It is geared towards readers interested in an in-depth analysis of storytelling.

#### Problem Solving and Justification
Here, the concept of "Justifications" is introduced. It suggests that characters, like real people, take actions that they believe are justifiable at the moment, even if they may regret them later. The justifications individuals provide can sometimes seem like excuses to others. This ambiguity about what is the "right" action gives rise to the complex dynamics of justification and problem-solving in narratives.

#### The Author Giveth; the Audience Taketh Away
In this section, the role of the author is highlighted. The author builds an argument in the story, proving through the outcomes and judgments in the narrative whether the main character's actions were justified. It emphasizes that in the story, the author's perspective is the objective truth, shaping the audience's understanding and evaluation of the character's actions.

#### Problems Start Innocently Enough
This segment suggests that characters, like real people, are driven by a quest to find joy and alleviate their pain. The difficulties in achieving these objectives arise due to the time it takes to resolve external and internal conflicts, which forms the basis of problem-solving. 

#### Getting to the Heart of the Problem
Here, problem-solving is defined as a gradual process where characters try to address their issues step by step. It highlights the potential for error in identifying the root of the problem and deciding on the course of action, leading to the concepts of justification and problem-solving.

#### Characters, Problems, and Justification
This part introduces the impact character, another central figure in the narrative who contrasts with the main character. The narrative explores the uncertainty in their approaches to solving problems, with one eventually being right (problem-solving) and the other wrong (justification), representing the human dilemma of decision-making in the face of uncertainty.

#### Why We Justify
This segment examines why characters (and people) justify their actions, emphasizing that it is not necessarily a reflection of malintent or stupidity but a reliance on personal life experiences to address current problems. It portrays justifications as a subjective process with uncertain outcomes.

#### Poor, Misguided Souls
In this section, the narrative takes a deeper look at the complex perspectives surrounding a character's actions, demonstrating how different stakeholders might have divergent views on the actions taken by the main and impact characters.

#### Uniqueness Means Never Having to Say, "I Agree"
This segment dives into the inherent conflict generated due to the unique life experiences of characters, which drive them to have incompatible approaches to problem-solving. It discusses the potential for conflicting views on what constitutes problem-solving and justification in a given context.

#### Tell Me A Message, Mommy
This part explains the ultimate purpose of a story: to convey a message, which might challenge or affirm the audience's beliefs. It reveals how the outcome of the story and the judgments passed on the characters' actions create an impact on the audience, potentially influencing their future decisions.

#### Step By Step, Slowly We Argued
In the conclusion, the passage emphasizes the role of the author in crafting a narrative that convinces the audience of their viewpoint, both logically and emotionally. It highlights the need for understanding the nuances of problem-solving and justification to create a compelling, convincing narrative.

#### Clarification:
Overall, this text discusses the complexities of crafting a story, with a focus on character development, problem-solving, and justification. It introduces a rich framework to analyze and build characters, stressing the role of the author in guiding the narrative and influencing the audience's perceptions. The deep theory seeks to dissect the intricate dynamics between the main character and the impact character, their decisions, justifications, and the subsequent outcomes of their actions, creating a narrative that not only entertains but also potentially alters the viewpoints of the audience. It essentially argues that stories serve as a means to explore the gray areas of decision-making and justification, where the right path is not always clear, reflecting the uncertainties faced in real life.

### A Simple Example of Problem Solving
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Main Concept**: 
The text delves into the complexities of problem-solving, justification, and the human tendency to cling to familiar patterns even when they no longer serve our best interests.

**Illustrative Example**:
The story of a waitress with an itching nose is presented. She goes through multiple steps to address her immediate problem (the itch) due to the obstacles she faces, like carrying plates. However, there were simpler solutions she overlooked. The progression of her decisions showcases how one can get caught up in addressing the problems with the solutions rather than directly addressing the initial problem.

**Core Ideas**:

1. **Problem Solving vs. Justification**: The process by which we address problems can sometimes become more complex due to justifications, leading us further away from a straightforward solution. Sometimes our indirect approach to problem-solving can be less efficient, especially when the context changes or under time constraints.
 
2. **Context is Critical**: The appropriateness of a problem-solving method or justification depends heavily on the context. What might work in one situation might be inefficient or inappropriate in another.

3. **Persistence in Old Patterns**: People tend to stick to what they know, even when evidence suggests that a change in approach is necessary. This can be because of the amount of past experience that supports the old approach or because many beliefs are built on foundational assumptions.

4. **Challenging Established Beliefs**: Changing deeply held beliefs or approaches is challenging, especially when these beliefs are foundational. It often requires a significant amount of contrasting evidence or a paradigm shift to change these core beliefs.

5. **Storytelling and Problem Solving**: In stories, characters often grapple with these challenges. They might cling to outdated or ineffective methods of problem-solving because they've lost sight of the original problem or because their approach has always worked in the past.

6. **Associations in Experience**: Over time, individuals create associations based on repeated experiences. These associations, or givens, can sometimes lead us astray, especially when taken out of their original context.

7. **Adapting to New Contexts**: As situations change, old solutions and beliefs might not apply anymore. Recognizing these changes and adapting is crucial, but often difficult due to our inherent resistance to change.

In essence, the text explores the intricate dance between sticking to what we know and adapting to changing contexts. It underscores the importance of re-evaluating our approaches and beliefs, especially when faced with new or evolving challenges.
## The Elements of Structure: Theme
In the presented text, the concept of theme in storytelling is discussed and detailed in the context of the Dramatica theory, a comprehensive theory of story structure.

### Summary:

#### Understanding Theme

According to the text, defining the theme of a story can be challenging, as it embodies different perspectives or angles like mood, message, and premise. It is emphasized that the theme is not independent; rather, it acts as a relationship between the plot and the characters, akin to viewing an object (the plot) from various viewpoints (the characters). This relational aspect makes the theme a complex component to define succinctly. It essentially describes the relationship between what is being looked at (the story's problem) and from where it is being seen (different points of view).

#### Classifying the Story's Problem

The theory also breaks down the problems encountered in a story into different classes: Universe (external situations), Mind (internal attitudes), Physics (external processes), and Psychology (internal processes). These classes are further divided into types that give a more refined perspective on the story's problem, offering both familiar and unfamiliar thematic areas for exploration.

#### Further Resolution and Thematic Topics

At a deeper level, these types are sub-divided into variations, bringing up a richer and more nuanced pool of thematic topics to explore. These variations help pinpoint more precisely the thematic nature of the story's problem, encouraging authors to explore beyond mainstream thematic topics and consider various perspectives on subject matters like love and greed.

#### Integration with Character Elements

Lastly, these variations further disintegrate into character elements, demonstrating that at the core of every thematic issue is character, representing different approaches to solving the story's central problem. This ties the character intricately with the theme, illustrating the depth of relationships in story development.

### Clarification:

1. **Theme as Perspective and Relationship**: The theme in a story is not just about mood, message, or premise, but it also encapsulates different perspectives and relations between the plot and characters. It illustrates the various viewpoints from which a central problem or aspect in a story is viewed.

2. **Classification of Problems**: The Dramatica theory categorizes the problems that are central to a story into four primary classes - Universe, Mind, Physics, and Psychology. Each of these classes can further be broken down to specific types representing more detailed dimensions of the problem.
![[Pasted image 20230909205104.png]]
3. **Variations and Thematic Exploration**: The theory advocates for a deeper exploration of themes by considering various variations that give a nuanced view of the central problem, allowing for fresh thematic explorations beyond mainstream topics.
![[Pasted image 20230909205235.png]]

5. **Theme and Character Integration**: The core of the thematic issue invariably boils down to character elements, illustrating that characters are the central pivot around which the theme evolves, representing different strategies to address the story's problem.

![[Pasted image 20230909205255.png]]

Overall, the text serves as a detailed guide to understanding, classifying, and detailing the theme in a story, presenting it as a multifaceted concept interlinked with characters and central problems in the narrative, thereby offering a rich playground for thematic exploration and storytelling.

![[Pasted image 20230909205402.png]]

In the presented text, the Dramatica theory of storytelling is applied to analyze the narrative of Star Wars, focusing on distinct throughlines - Overall Story, Main Character, Impact Character, and Subjective Story. Below, each concept is summarized and clarified:

### Throughlines:

#### **1.1 Overall Story Throughline:**
- **Aspect:** Activity (Physics)
- **Explanation:** The primary narrative revolves around the physical and military conflict between the Empire and the Rebellion. This story doesn't have a fixed location, but instead, it explores various strategies, battles, and encounters between the two forces.

#### **1.2 Main Character Throughline:**
- **Aspect:** Situation (Universe)
- **Explanation:** This focuses on Luke Skywalker, who is initially perceived as a naive young man from a remote desert planet. Despite his mundane beginnings, he harbors latent talents inherited from his Jedi father, which set the stage for his growth and evolution.

#### **1.3 Impact Character Throughline:**
- **Aspect:** Fixed Attitude (Mind)
- **Explanation:** This throughline centers on Obi-Wan Kenobi, a stalwart believer and practitioner of the Force. His unwavering faith in the Force, coupled with his deep understanding of its light and dark sides, significantly influence the narratives and characters, especially Luke.

#### **1.4 Subjective Story Throughline:**
- **Aspect:** Manipulation (Psychology)
- **Explanation:** This section highlights the manipulative tactics used by Obi-Wan to guide and sometimes coerce Luke into fulfilling his destiny. Through psychological maneuvers and strategic withholding of information, Obi-Wan shapes Luke's journey and decisions.

### **2. Concerns:**

This section elaborates on the principal concerns in each throughline, highlighting actions, progress, impulsive responses, and role-playing as vital elements driving the narrative, character development, and their interactions.

### **3. Issues:**

The issues section discusses the underlying themes explored in each throughline, such as the value of skill, the allure of fantasy, the reevaluation of worth, and the importance of nurturing abilities. These themes play a critical role in character development and the unfolding of the story.

### **4. Problems:**

This segment identifies the fundamental problems or conflicts in each throughline, primarily revolving around tests, trust, proving one's beliefs, and maintaining a balance in relationships. These conflicts drive the narrative and facilitate character growth and transformation.

### **5. Matching Points of View to the Chart:**

Lastly, the text suggests that the theme of a story is a matter of perspective, created by examining a problem and its ramifications from various viewpoints. This approach is an essential tool in crafting a complete and immersive story.

This analysis based on the Dramatica theory provides a structured and detailed examination of the different facets of the Star Wars narrative, dissecting its components to understand the complex interplay of themes, characters, and plot developments.

### Overall Story Throughline
In the excerpt from "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" you've provided, the concept of structuring a complete story using four primary throughlines or perspectives is discussed. These throughlines correspond to four different classes of problems: Situation (Universe), Fixed Attitude (Mind), Activity (Physics), and Manipulation (Psychology). Here's a clarified and summarized version of your text:

#### **Summary and Clarification**

#### **Overview: Setting Up Thematic Perspectives in Story**

To craft a well-rounded story, an author must incorporate four different throughlines, each representing different classes of problems. These throughlines are assigned to different points of view in the story, which helps in laying the foundation for the thematic perspectives in the narrative.

1. **Situation (Universe) Throughline**: This pertains to problems arising from external situations affecting all characters in a story. Depending on its association with a point of view, it could depict a widespread issue like a post-nuclear world or specific personal situations exclusive to the main character, like having a physical deformity.

2. **Activity (Physics) Throughline**: This concerns problems originating from an activity or action that has gone wrong. The activity should be external and could range from a large-scale event to a smaller yet significant issue, like dry rot in a house.

3. **Fixed Attitude (Mind) Throughline**: This class represents issues stemming from internal states, such as fixed attitudes or internal conflicts within a group of people. It could depict a story revolving around prejudice affecting a town or memories haunting a kingdom.

4. **Manipulation (Psychology) Throughline**: This reflects problems arising from the manner of thinking or psychological manipulations. It could depict narratives where the conflict arises from manipulative tactics or clashing thought processes.

#### **Differentiating Between Situation and Activity**

To differentiate between Situation and Activity throughlines, one needs to identify whether the problem stems from having a particular circumstance (situation) or from fighting against or engaging with it (activity). Both these aspects may appear in a story, but one will be highlighted as the primary source of conflict affecting all characters.

#### **Utilizing Throughlines for a Rounded Story**

In crafting a story, the assignment of these throughlines to various points of view (like the Main Character or Overall Story) creates different perspectives and alters how dramatic elements within that class are portrayed. By doing this, the author can depict a range of problems from different angles, offering a richer, more nuanced narrative.

The essence here is that these throughlines help in fleshing out a story by offering different perspectives on the problem at hand, making the narrative more rounded and comprehensive.
### Main Character Throughline
#### Summary and Clarification

The passage discusses the process of defining the "Main Character Throughline" in story writing, which essentially delineates the sphere within which the main character operates. Here's a brief breakdown and clarification of each segment in your text:

#### **Choosing the Main Character Throughline**

The Main Character Throughline is a critical aspect of story crafting as it helps the audience connect with the main character. The throughline is determined based on the class (Situation, Fixed Attitude, Activity, Manipulation) assigned to it, which sets the main character's mindset and shapes their experiences in the narrative. 

#### **Various Classes as Main Character Throughline**

1. **Situation (Universe)**: This class portrays the main character as someone defined by their circumstances or conditions, which might be social, physical, or related to their position in society. It paints a picture of a character ensnared by their specific situation, be it societal status or a physical condition.

2. **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: Here, the main character is depicted as holding a persistent mindset or attitude, which can be a prejudice, a haunting memory, or an unshakeable fixation on someone or something. This fixed mental state is the source of the character's dilemmas and conflicts in the story.

3. **Activity (Physics)**: This category highlights the main character as an action-oriented individual. They might be characterized by their active pursuit of something or their eagerness to understand or learn something. Despite seeming internal, these activities are external applications, differing fundamentally from original, internal thoughts.

4. **Manipulation (Psychology)**: This class signifies a character best described by their manner of thinking. The distinctive element here is the type of mental processes they engage in, rather than the opinions they hold. This throughline provides the audience with an immersive experience into the character's unique way of thinking.

#### **Approach to Developing a Story**

In developing a story, the author might opt to first choose the Main Character Throughline, especially if they are keen on deeply exploring the main character's nature and concerns. However, it's important to remember that once a class is assigned to a throughline (like the Main Character Throughline), it cannot be utilized for other throughlines, thereby establishing distinct boundaries for each throughline in the story development process.

In essence, this passage offers guidance on constructing a well-rounded main character by selecting an appropriate throughline, which serves to not only define the character's essence but also to create a strong connection with the audience. It emphasizes careful selection and unique allocation of classes to throughlines to craft a rich and engaging narrative.
### Impact Character Throughline
#### Summary and Clarification

In this passage, the concept of an "Impact Character Throughline" in story crafting is discussed. It is vital to differentiate between the "Main Character" and the "Impact Character" for the effective portrayal of a story. Here's a breakdown and clarification of each part of your text:

#### **Understanding the Impact Character Throughline**

The Impact Character provides an external perspective on the situation or condition mirrored in the Main Character. While the audience empathizes and experiences the trials and tribulations of the Main Character, they perceive the Impact Character from an outside viewpoint, assessing their effect on other characters and events. The core focus is to analyze how the Impact Character "impacts" others, offering a contrasting perspective to the experiences of the Main Character.

#### **Various Throughlines of Impact Character**

1. **Situation (Universe)**: In this throughline, the Impact Character influences others due to their social status, race, gender, or other situational attributes. This presents an alternate paradigm, providing a different lens to view the situation compared to the Main Character.

2. **Activity (Physics)**: Here, the Impact Character engages in activities that encompass learning, understanding, doing, or obtaining. They serve to challenge the Main Character's stance, showcasing the repercussions of these activities more than the experiential aspect of engaging in them.

3. **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: This throughline represents an Impact Character with a strong fixation or attitude, mainly revolving around their memories, desires, or immediate responses. Their stance encourages the Main Character to rethink or justify their position in the story.

4. **Manipulation (Psychology)**: In this scenario, the Impact Character influences others either by direct manipulation or due to their unique thought process. This throughline focuses on illustrating how their thinking pattern affects those they interact with, providing an external view of the repercussions of their thought processes.

#### **Clarification**

Overall, this passage explores the nuanced role of the Impact Character in a story, highlighting their function to provide an external viewpoint and influence on the narrative, often serving as a counterpoint or alternative to the Main Character's experiences and perspectives. The selection of an appropriate throughline for the Impact Character can offer depth and complexity to the story, enhancing the narrative by presenting varied facets and impacts of the story's central issues or themes. The emphasis is on showcasing the "impact" these characters have on the storyline and other characters, offering a richer, multifaceted narrative experience.
### Subjective Story Throughline
#### Summary and Clarification

#### **Summary**

The Subjective Story Throughline serves as a domain where the emotional conflict and passionate argument between the Main and Impact Characters in a story unfold. It is integral in forming the emotional resonance of a story, focusing specifically on the dichotomy and relationship between these two central characters. This can be depicted through various Classes or perspectives - Situation (Universe), Activity (Physics), Fixed Attitude (Mind), and Manipulation (Psychology), each offering a distinct avenue of conflict and emotional discourse between the characters:

1. **Situation (Universe)**: The conflict is rooted in a specific situation or relationship that involves the characters, which could range from marital disagreements to business partnerships. The emphasis here is on the relational dynamics amidst specific circumstances.
   
2. **Activity (Physics)**: The characters find themselves at odds over a particular activity or set of actions, which might have different motivations or outcomes. This conflict forms the central emotional debate in the story.
   
3. **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: This encapsulates scenarios where the central conflict arises from conflicting ideologies or beliefs, ranging from prejudice to political views, that create a tension between the characters.
   
4. **Manipulation (Psychology)**: This perspective highlights conflicts arising from differing methods of thinking or problem-solving, where the process itself, rather than a specific attitude or situation, creates the rift between the characters.

#### **Clarification**

In essence, the passage breaks down the narrative concept of the "Subjective Story Throughline," explaining how it serves as a platform to showcase the emotional and argumentative dynamics between the Main and Impact Characters. Depending on the class chosen for the throughline, it can steer the story in different emotional directions, giving the audience varied perspectives on the conflict at hand. This tool allows authors to craft a richer narrative experience, creating nuanced, passionate arguments and discussions within the story that resonate emotionally with the audience. It essentially forms the backdrop where the emotional battles and conflicts between the main and impact characters are fought, lending a deeper layer of complexity and emotion to the narrative.
### Throughlines and Beyond
In this comprehensive excerpt from "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story," the nuances of creating a complex, rich narrative are explored through the lens of different story throughlines and concerns, further breaking down into classes, types, and variations that inform these throughlines and concerns. Here's a summary and clarification of each section discussed in the passage:

#### Subjective Story Throughline
**Summary:**
The Subjective Story Throughline focuses on the relationship and conflict between the Main and Impact Characters. The choice of class for this throughline significantly influences the emotional tone and engagement of the story. It can be depicted through different lenses: Situation (Universe), Activity (Physics), Fixed Attitude (Mind), and Manipulation (Psychology), each proposing a different kind of conflict and dynamics between the main and impact characters.

**Clarification:**
- **Situation (Universe):** This involves conflicts based on situations or conditions, like a marriage contract or business partnership, emphasizing time aspects like past, present, or future.
- **Activity (Physics):** Here, the conflict is based on an activity the characters are involved in, which might have various motivations.
- **Fixed Attitude (Mind):** This scenario portrays conflict centered around fixed mental states or attitudes.
- **Manipulation (Psychology):** This focuses on conflicts stemming from different ways of thinking or problem-solving approaches that are not appreciated by the characters involved.

### Concerns
**Summary:**
Concerns represent areas where problems are most prominent within each throughline - Overall Story, Main Character, Impact Character, and Subjective Story. These concerns highlight the different dimensions of the story's central problem from various perspectives, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. 

**Clarification:**
- **Overall Story Concern:** A shared concern amongst all characters, possibly focused on a common goal or varied personal objectives. 
- **Main Character Concern:** Specific to the Main Character, detailing their primary worries or interests regarding the central problem.
- **Impact Character Concern:** Reflects the area where the Impact Character has the most significant influence or effect.
- **Subjective Story Concern:** Focuses on the primary area of conflict or disagreement between the Main and Impact Characters.

### Variations on a Theme
**Summary:**
This part explains how the story's problem is refined further through "Issues" that explore the themes within each throughline. These issues help in establishing thematic conflicts and providing depth to the character's perspectives and the story's thematic narrative.

**Clarification:**
- **Overall Story Issue:** It reflects the universal values and judgments prevalent in the story, often manifested in thematic conflicts like Morality vs. Self-Interest.
- **Main Character Issue:** A personal thematic conflict pertinent to the Main Character, adding depth to their perspective.
- **Impact Character Issue:** Helps evaluate the Impact Character's influence, giving the author a tool to depict their bias subtly.
- **Subjective Story Issue:** Highlights why the Main and Impact Characters have conflicts over the shared concern, bringing out the different evaluation standards used by them.

#### It's Elemental!
**Summary:**
This section indicates that the elemental level is where the core problems in each throughline are found, fundamentally driving the actions and conflicts in the narrative.

**Clarification:**
At the elemental level, each throughline has a central problem that drives the characters and their actions. These problems can relate to individual drives or the relationship between characters, helping in establishing the author's stance on the central issues of the story.

In a nutshell, this theory emphasizes a structured and multidimensional approach to crafting a story, ensuring a rich, comprehensive narrative that encompasses various perspectives and thematic layers.

### Deep Theme

This text introduces the concept of "Thematic Argument" in the Dramatica theory of story development. The theory delves deeply into the thematic elements of storytelling and discusses how to build a persuasive and compelling narrative. Here is a summarized and clarified breakdown of the main points discussed in the passage:

#### Deep Theme and Thematic Argument

- **Concepts introduced**: Deep Theme and Thematic Argument
- **Explanation**: The text emphasizes that simply defining elements of a theme is insufficient; they must also be brought to life or put into motion via a thematic argument. This argument is essential to engage audiences and persuade them regarding the author's standpoint on the story's central issues. The argument should appeal to audiences on an emotional level and provide valuable insights into real-life situations.
  
#### Premise and Thematic Argument

- **Concepts introduced**: Premise and Thematic Argument
- **Explanation**: It suggests that a thematic argument often starts with a premise, a concise statement that illustrates the central argument of a story (e.g., "Greed leads to self-destruction"). However, it argues that traditional premises are limited as they only offer a singular viewpoint, lacking depth and nuance. Moreover, these premises do not facilitate the author in crafting a well-rounded thematic argument.
- **Dramatica's approach**: Introduces a thematic conflict where each narrative thread (throughline) presents a different viewpoint on the thematic conflict, offering a more detailed and nuanced exploration of the theme.

#### Dramatica's Thematic Argument

- **Concepts introduced**: Thematic conflict, Issue, Counterpoint
- **Explanation**: The thematic argument in Dramatica is constructed through thematic conflicts which are represented by an Issue and a counterpoint, which opposes it dynamically. It emphasizes the necessity of portraying both sides of the argument to persuade the audience effectively. Moreover, it allows the author to present nuanced perspectives on each side rather than a binary good vs. bad depiction.
- **Outcome and Judgment**: Explains that the thematic argument concludes with two aspects: the outcome (success or failure) and the judgment (good or bad), offering four broad conclusions: happy ending, tragedy, personal tragedy, and personal triumph. These conclusions depend on the resolution of the thematic conflicts and the audience's emotional journey through the story.

#### Sewing Together the Themes

- **Concepts introduced**: Thematic conflict development, story points and their relationships
- **Explanation**: Highlights the limitations of traditional premises and promotes Dramatica's approach to thematic arguments, which encompasses thematic conflict, valuation of standards, and an assessment of satisfaction and fulfillment. It further discusses the complexity of relationships between different story points and the necessity of a computer to maintain consistency.

#### Additional Story Points

- **Concepts introduced**: Throughline, Concern, Issue, Problem, Solution, Focus, Direction, Unique Ability, Critical Flaw, Catalyst, Inhibitor, Benchmark
- **Explanation**: Expands on additional story points in the Dramatica theory, such as Problem, Solution, Focus, and Direction in various throughlines, along with Unique Abilities and Critical Flaws in Main and Impact Character Throughlines. It explains the influence of Catalysts and Inhibitors on the pacing of the story and introduces Benchmarks as a method of charting the growth of each throughline. 

Overall, the passage outlines a detailed approach to constructing thematic arguments in storytelling, offering authors a nuanced and comprehensive tool to craft compelling narratives. It emphasizes the role of conflict and a balanced portrayal of different aspects of the thematic conflict in engaging the audience and creating a persuasive narrative.
## The Elements of Structure: Plot
The passage details a section from the book "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story", where the intricacies of story structure are dissected, particularly focusing on the concept of 'plot' and 'storyweaving'. It's important to differentiate between the plot (the actual sequence of events within a story) and the way these events are presented or revealed to the audience - a concept referred to as 'storyweaving'.

To illustrate this difference, examples from various novels and movies are cited. In essence, the plot structure maintains an internal logic from the perspective of the characters involved, while the order in which this is conveyed to the audience can vary. The sequence can either follow a chronological order or be rearranged to create a different impact on the audience, without altering the underlying logic or message of the plot.

The passage then transitions into the thematic aspects of a plot, introducing 'plot story points' which are elements that form the core of the storyline, impacting all characters and connecting different storylines together. These elements include goal, requirements, consequences, forewarnings, dividends, costs, prerequisites, and preconditions.

1. **Goal** - The central objective that binds all characters, derived from their individual concerns.
2. **Requirements** - Essential steps or conditions that must be met to achieve the goal.
3. **Consequences** - What happens if the goal is not achieved, often manifested as troubles or challenges that the characters have to face.
4. **Forewarnings** - Indicators of how close the characters are to facing the consequences, raising the tension in the storyline.
5. **Dividends** - Benefits or rewards that characters receive during their journey towards the goal, serving to motivate them to continue.
6. **Costs** - Negative repercussions or sacrifices that characters have to endure while striving towards the goal, adding layers of complexity to the story.
7. **Prerequisites** - Essential elements or conditions that need to be secured before the characters can pursue the goal.
8. **Preconditions** - Additional, non-essential conditions imposed on the characters, usually by external forces, adding a further layer of complexity to the plot.

It also highlights that these elements can vary in their degree of influence on the plot, categorized as either 'Driver' story points (Goal, Requirements, Consequences, Forewarnings) which direct the core path of the story, or 'Passenger' story points (Dividends, Costs, Prerequisites, Preconditions) which modulate or influence the course set by the drivers, providing depth and nuance to the narrative.

Furthermore, the passage illustrates how these plot story points can be embedded within different cultural narratives and how they interact with character dynamics, shaping the overall narrative structure. It explains that these elements remain consistent, even when viewed from different perspectives or through different thematic lenses.

Overall, the excerpt provides an in-depth analysis of plot structure and thematic elements, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding and crafting compelling narratives.

### Plot Progression
This text discusses the intricacies of constructing a detailed narrative, breaking down the plot structure into a series of points and throughlines, all of which are essential to weaving a comprehensive story.

Here's a summarized clarification of the text:

In crafting a story, different components and perspectives work together to build the narrative's plot progression. These elements are categorized into several story points:

1. **Overall Story Throughline Points**: General story points that describe the central narrative arc.
2. **Main Character Story Points**: Points focusing on the main character's journey and evolution.
3. **Impact Character Story Points**: Points that highlight the role and influence of the impact character in the story.
4. **Subjective Story Throughline Points**: These emphasize the relationship and interactions between the main and impact characters.

Apart from the above, there are central story points like "Goal," "Requirements," and "Consequences" that synthesize the perspectives of all four throughlines, significantly influencing the plot progression.

These story points exhibit a consistent nature throughout the story, referred to as **Static Story Points**. They represent a theme or a commentary on the entire narrative, maintaining their characteristics from the beginning to the end of the story. They shape the plot and influence the characters' concerns and issues.

Conversely, **Progressive Story Points** depict how the story evolves over time. They represent a different appreciation level in the story, moving from one issue to another as the narrative develops. These points are structured as Acts, Sequences, Scenes, and Events, working similarly to how we measure time (Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds). They nest within each other, each bearing the flavor of the larger unit it resides in and influencing the smaller units it encompasses. These progressive points explain how the story unfolds, whereas static points describe what the story is about.

An analogy used in the text compares the intertwining throughlines to a football game watched by four referees, each offering a unique perspective on the events happening on the field, thus influencing the unfolding of the game. Similarly, in a story, each throughline provides a different angle on the events, influencing and being influenced by the other throughlines in a consistent manner. 

In conclusion, understanding the narrative's static and progressive story points allows one to appreciate the story's depth, with the actual plot emerging as a synthesis of all four throughline plots, which is realized in the audience's mind as the story progresses. The ultimate goal is to create a well-rounded narrative that intricately combines these elements to convey the story's true meaning.
### *Acts*
This passage elucidates a concept in the "Dramatica" theory of story structure concerning the progression of acts within a narrative. Here's a breakdown:

#### Thematic Structure and Throughline Concerns:
- **Classes** in the thematic structure have four types each, which dwell a level below the class.
- In the **Activity (Physics) Class**, these types are Learning, Understanding, Doing, and Obtaining.
- One of these types will be a **throughline's Concern** - a central focus that remains constant throughout the story.
- For instance, if "Obtaining" is the concern of the **Overall Story Throughline**, characters in the story will persistently be engrossed with "obtaining" something from the beginning till the end.
- However, the characters actively engage in a series of efforts in order to realize this concern, which is divided into stages represented by the types: Learning, Understanding, Doing, and Obtaining.

#### The Significance of Sequence:
- The sequence in which these stages or types are explored can vary, which, in turn, alters the meaning created by the narrative.
- Analogically, the order of two events (a slap and a scream, as given in the text) can change their progressive meaning although their static meaning remains unchanged.
- This principle applies to the development of acts in a story, where the order of exploring the types modifies the progressive interpretation of the plot in that throughline.

#### 3-Act Progression versus 4-Act Structure:
- Despite Aristotle's ancient theory advocating for a three-act structure in storytelling (beginning, middle, and end), the Dramatica theory proposes a four-act structure.
- This four-act structure can be visualized as a journey between four cities (A, B, C, D), with three separate journeys connecting them.
- Each of these cities represents a **signpost**, a stage in the plot, and the journeys represent transitions between these stages.
- Therefore, in a four-act structure, there are four signposts and three journeys, amounting to seven progressive story points in a throughline, offering a more nuanced view of the narrative progression compared to the traditional three-act structure.
- Essentially, this perspective makes it easier to understand and construct a plot, avoiding the ambiguity that often comes with determining the events in the middle section (Act 2) of a three-act structure.

#### Summary:
The passage explores the intricate nature of story building, emphasizing the significance of thematic classes and types in constructing a plot. It introduces a nuanced four-act structure, contrasting it with Aristotle's three-act plot progression theory, demonstrating how the modern four-act structure can provide a more detailed and clear roadmap for narrative development, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding and construction of a story's plot.

### *Sequences*
This passage from "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" discusses the concept of "Sequences", which are a critical part of the progressive story points in narrative structure according to the Dramatica theory.

#### Clarification and Detailed Summary:

##### About Sequences:

- **Sequences**, like acts, are a form of progressive story points, but are more closely aligned with the theme of the story rather than the plot. They fall under the variation level of the structure.
- Sequences work with a quad of variations, just as acts work with a quad of types.
![[Pasted image 20230909212420.png]]
##### Analyzing Sequences through an Example:

- The text illustrates an example where the story has an **Overall Story Throughline** in the **Activity (Physics) Class**, and the main concern is "Obtaining", and the central issue is "Morality".
- In the context of this story, the **Morality Quad** consists of the following elements: **Approach, Morality, Attitude,** and **Self-Interest**. 
- Morality and Self-Interest form a counter-point pair, and the theme of the story comes from the balance between various pairs that can be created from the quad elements.
  
##### Exploring Various Pairs within the Morality Quad:

- Six pairs can be made from the elements in the quad, each offering a different angle to explore the relative value of Morality to Self-Interest. These pairs are:
  1. Morality/Self-Interest
  2. Morality/Attitude
  3. Morality/Approach
  4. Self-Interest/Attitude
  5. Self-Interest/Approach
  6. Attitude/Approach
- Analyzing these pairs through different thematic sequences can thoroughly explore the argument regarding the absolute value of Morality in comparison to Self-Interest.
![[Pasted image 20230909212430.png]]
##### Questions to Explore Each Pair:

The passage suggests exploring each pair by asking specific questions, such as assessing the better of the two between Morality and Self-Interest, evaluating the attitude and approach of those who uphold Morality or Self-Interest, and deciding which should have more weight between Attitude and Approach concerning the issue at hand.

#### Simplified Summary:

The passage describes the role of sequences in developing the theme of a story as per the Dramatica theory. Sequences exist at the variation level of the narrative structure and engage with a group of closely related aspects, known as a quad, to scrutinize and establish the theme further. Through the analysis of various possible pairs within a quad, like the Morality quad in the given example, the thematic argument of a story can be fully developed and presented, adding depth to the narrative by examining different perspectives and relative values connected to the central issue.
### *How Sequences Relate to Acts*

#### Summary and Clarification:

The passage discusses the role of sequences, acts, and scenes in shaping a story according to the Dramatica theory of story development. 

##### Sequences and Acts:

**Sequences** relate to acts in a specific way. They form the thematic backbone of the story, with different sequences exploring various thematic questions, usually centered around the story's central issue. They are divided into three or four-act structures, with the thematic sequences occurring in pairs within three dynamic acts. This division forms the plot and theme progression that gives an act break its distinctive feel. The ordering of these sequences can influence the audience's thematic experience but not the overall message of the story.

##### Four Act Progressions:

Meanwhile, in a **four-act progression**, the acts serve as a roadmap of the story’s terrain. Each act explores a particular “Type”, and the theme associated with that type is examined through four variations that lie beneath it. This process allows for a thematic statement to be made about the central subject of concern in each of the structural acts. 

##### Scene Resolutions and Elements:

**Scenes**, on the other hand, are the minutiae in the storytelling, where the dynamics between various elements are captured and exhibited, mainly focusing on character relationships. These elements are building blocks of characters encompassing motivations, methodologies, means of evaluation, and purposes. The scene thus is a temporal container holding dynamics within its bounds and also highlighting the shifts in dynamics between the elements over time.

##### Interrelationship between Theme, Scenes, and Acts:

The total number of scenes generated at the elemental level is 24, evenly distributed across acts, contributing to the distinct feel at each act break. These 24 scenes are partitioned in such a way to accommodate both three and four-act structures comfortably, thereby ensuring a seamless progression of the story. Sequences, a crucial aspect in this setup, play a vital role in defining thematic movements, which have a potent subjective appreciation but diminish in a more objective four-act view.

#### Simplified Summary:

The passage explains the intricate interplay between sequences, acts, and scenes in crafting a story as per Dramatica theory. Sequences, forming the thematic crux, work harmoniously within a three or four-act structure, exploring and addressing various thematic queries central to the story's issue. Scenes encapsulate the dynamic relationships between characters, driven by underlying elements that constitute the characters. This comprehensive approach to storytelling ensures a rich, layered narrative where thematic sequences, plot developments, and character dynamics are finely intertwined, offering a robust and engaging narrative experience to the audience.

### Themes & Events
### Summary and Clarification:

This excerpt discusses the intricate nature of story crafting, highlighting the nuances of scenes, sequences, and events in the context of the Dramatica theory of story.

#### Scene Resolution and Dynamics:

When it comes to **scene resolution**, the concept speaks to the need for minimizing focus to truly understand the dynamic workings within the scene, amidst the potential clutter of multiple narrative layers. Scenes are essentially temporal containers that encapsulate dynamics, characterized by changing relationships between characters, and these dynamics are built upon elements representing motivations, methodologies, evaluation methods, and purposes. 

#### Relation Between Scenes and Acts:

The text then describes the arithmetic of how scenes fit into acts. It states that **24 scenes** are constructed at the elemental level, which break down evenly into both three and four-act structures. This division contributes to the feeling that each act break signifies a significant turning point in the story. Sequences, which partition the story into six parts, fit evenly into a three-act structure but not into a four-act one, illustrating the difference between subjective appreciation and objective analysis in storytelling.

#### Event Resolution and Throughlines:

In the section on **events**, it is illustrated that the Dramatica model is recursive, circling back at the end to reconsider the beginning, thus creating a loop. The smallest dynamic units in the model blend into the largest structural units. Events are depicted by broader stroke structural units called Classes, which encompass Situation (Universe), Fixed Attitude (Mind), Activity (Physics), and Manipulation (Psychology). Each scene needs to describe all four classes to be considered complete, portraying a situation, an activity, a manner of thinking, and a state of mind. 

#### Misrepresentation of Events as Scenes:

However, sometimes what might seem like scenes are actually events. In a well-structured story, a total of **96 events** occur, divided across 24 scenes. The illusion of more scenes often occurs due to changing locations within events, which might lead one to perceive separate scenes. However, a well-designed story will show that all four classes are represented, emphasizing certain aspects of the narrative over others.

### Simplified Summary:

The passage elaborates on the Dramatica theory of story crafting, focusing on the dynamics of scenes and events. It illustrates that scenes are temporal containers encapsulating various dynamics and changing relationships between characters built on foundational elements. The structure of a story is carefully divided into 24 scenes that seamlessly fit into three or four-act structures, with sequences playing a significant role in the thematic movements of the story.

Furthermore, the story model is recursive, with events representing the broader structural units of Classes. These events, forming the intricate fabric of the story, often mislead as separate scenes due to changes in location or emphasis within the narrative, contributing to a complex yet rich storytelling process.
## The Elements of Structure: Genre
**Summary and Clarification:**

The given text presents a deep dive into the understanding of story structure, focusing heavily on how different components (Characters, Themes, Plots, and Genre) are built upon specific structural levels. 

**Core Points:**

1. **Character, Theme, Plot, and Genre Structure:**
   - The *Character* structure is based on the *Element* level.
   - The *Theme* primarily comes from the *Variation* level.
   - The *Plot* is derived from the *Types*.
   - The *Genre* is most influenced by the *Class* level.

2. **Throughlines & Genre:**
   - Assigning a perspective to a Class results in a story's Throughlines. These Throughlines have the largest structural influence on Genre.

3. **Storytelling and Structural Components:**
   - As one moves from Character to Plot, structural components (Elements, Variations, Types) decrease in significance compared to storytelling.
   - Character is defined by its dramatic functions, Theme by dramatic variations, and Plot by its acts.
   - Genre is the least structural aspect and is more influenced by storytelling.

4. **Understanding Genre:**
   - Genres can refer to settings (e.g., Westerns, Science Fiction), character relationships (e.g., Love Stories), audience feelings (e.g., Horror, Comedy), or even storytelling styles (e.g., Musicals).
   - Traditional Genre classifications (like those in video stores) are limiting and only really help categorize finished works. They don't assist writers in the creation process.
  
5. **Dramatica's Approach to Genre:**
   - Dramatica aids writers in building a story's underlying structure. 
   - Encoding is like placing muscle on the skeleton, weaving is like clothing the creation, and reception is how the audience reacts.
   - When seen from a writer's viewpoint, the foundation for Genre is structural. It begins by understanding four Classes:
     - **Situation (Universe):** External state; a situation.
     - **Activity (Physics):** External process; an activity.
     - **Fixed Attitude (Mind):** Internal state; an attitude or bias.
     - **Manipulation (Psychology):** Internal process; a thinking manner or manipulation.

6. **Modes of Expression:**
   - Dramatica introduces four modes of expression that help convey the story's structure to the audience:
     - **Information:** Emphasizes knowledge.
     - **Drama:** Emphasizes thought.
     - **Comedy:** Emphasizes ability.
     - **Entertainment:** Emphasizes desire.

7. **Combining Classes with Modes:**
   - By matching the Dramatica Classes with the modes of expression, authors can control the story's feel.
   - This is like how Throughlines are formed by connecting a point of view to a Class.
   - Genres create external perspectives, while Throughlines are internal to the story and depict how perspectives shift.

In essence, the text elaborates on the intricacies of story structure, focusing on how different components interact and influence one another, with special emphasis on the role and understanding of Genre. Dramatica offers a fresh perspective on understanding and categorizing Genre to assist writers more effectively.
### Grid of Dramatica Genres 
In the text, the concept of genre within the framework of "Dramatica," a theory of storytelling, is discussed in great depth. Here's a summary and clarification of the core ideas presented in the text:

#### Summary:

The "Dramatica" theory proposes a structured approach to storytelling, examining it through various levels: Elements, Variations, Types, and Classes, each progressively influencing the story less structurally and more in terms of storytelling nuances. The theory explores how genre, a component significantly influenced at the Class level, can be defined and utilized more effectively by writers to craft deeper, more engaging stories. It introduces a grid that combines four Classes (Situation, Activity, Fixed Attitude, Manipulation) with four modes of expression (Information, Drama, Comedy, Entertainment) to help authors predict the impact and feel of their stories on audiences. Additionally, it highlights the importance of aligning these combinations with four Dramatica Throughlines to position the audience’s perspective and engagement with the story appropriately.

#### Clarification:

1. **Classes and Modes of Expression**: 
   - **Classes**: Represent the subject matter that will be covered in a story's genre. They are broken down into:
     - **Situation (Universe)**: External states or conditions.
     - **Activity (Physics)**: External processes or actions.
     - **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: Internal states, attitudes, or biases.
     - **Manipulation (Psychology)**: Internal processes, thinking, or manipulations.
   
   - **Modes of Expression**: Represent the ways a story’s structure can be conveyed to the audience, comprising:
     - **Information**: Focuses on knowledge or education.
     - **Drama**: Engages the audience in serious thought or exploration.
     - **Comedy**: Evokes humor, highlighting abilities or mishaps.
     - **Entertainment**: Focuses on catering to the audience's desires, providing diversion through various means.

2. **Grid of Dramatica Genres**: A tool that helps authors determine the impact and feel of their story on the audience by combining Classes and modes of expression. This grid suggests various types of genres based on the combination of classes and modes, for instance:
   - Informational Documentaries (Information/Situation)
   - Action Dramas (Drama/Activity)
   - Situational Comedies (Comedy/Situation)
   - Entertainment through Thrills (Entertainment/Activity), etc.

3. **Throughlines**: These are used to position the audience in relation to the subject matter, providing different perspectives and engagement levels. The four Throughlines are:
   - **Main Character Throughline**: Offers a personal, first-person view of the story.
   - **Impact Character Throughline**: Gives an impersonal, second-person view focusing on the impact of events or characters.
   - **Subjective Story Throughline**: Provides a passionate view of relationships in the story, using a first-person plural perspective.
   - **Overall Story Throughline**: Offers a broader, third-person perspective on the story, presenting the "big picture."

By combining these concepts strategically, writers can craft stories with well-defined genres that offer deeper engagement and a balanced structure, enhancing the art of storytelling.

|               | Situation (Universe) | Activity (Physics) | Fixed Attitude (Mind) | Manipulation (Psychology) |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Information (Education)    | Where/What it is     | How it works       | What it means         | Why it's important        |
| Drama (Serious)        | Exploration Drama    | Action Drama       | Bias Drama            | Growth Drama              |

| Entertainment (Diversion)  | Entertainment through Atmosphere | Entertainment through Thrills | Entertainment through Concept | Entertainment through Twists |

#### Information (Education)

1. **Where/What it is (Situation/Universe)**: This category explores events and situations, emphasizing the evolution and the current state of affairs. Genres in this category often include documentaries and historical pieces.
   
2. **How it Works (Activity/Physics)**: Here, the focus is on examining and explaining specific processes or activities, often seen in educational, informational, or instructional content.

3. **What it Means (Fixed Attitude/Mind)**: This explores various opinions and viewpoints, emphasizing the context they are made in. It often includes inspirational and motivational content.

4. **Why it's Important (Manipulation/Psychology)**: This category involves examining value systems, focusing on providing context that is personally relevant to the audience, often seen in persuasive or propagandist content.

#### Drama (Serious)

1. **Exploration Drama (Situation/Universe)**: This involves serious scrutiny of an unbalanced "state of things", often seen in courtroom, crime, or classroom dramas.
   
2. **Action Drama (Activity/Physics)**: Focuses on the problems arising from ongoing activities, often encompassing genres like espionage and war dramas.

3. **Bias Drama (Fixed Attitude/Mind)**: Takes a serious look at conflicts that arise from conflicting attitudes, found in genres focusing on obsession and prejudice.

4. **Growth Drama (Manipulation/Psychology)**: Examines the efforts to overcome difficulties stemming from manipulations or evolving identities, as seen in coming-of-age and dysfunctional family dramas.

#### Comedy (Humor)

1. **Situation Comedy (Situation/Universe)**: Emphasizes humor arising from characters placed in various predicaments, commonly found in TV sitcoms.

2. **Physical Comedy (Activity/Physics)**: Encompasses humor derived from physical activities, typically seen in slapstick comedies and works of Charlie Chaplin.

3. **Comedy of Manners (Fixed Attitude/Mind)**: Focuses on humor arising from conflicting attitudes and biases, often seen in drawing-room comedies like works by Oscar Wilde.

4. **Comedy of Errors (Manipulation/Psychology)**: Encompasses humor derived from misinterpretations or attribution errors, as seen in several Shakespearean comedies.

#### Entertainment (Diversion)

1. **Entertainment through Atmosphere (Situation/Universe)**: Involves entertainment arising from unique or interesting settings, including genres like fantasy, horror, and science fiction.

2. **Entertainment through Thrills (Activity/Physics)**: Focuses on providing entertainment through unique or exhilarating experiences, typically found in action adventures or suspense genres.

3. **Entertaining Concept (Fixed Attitude/Mind)**: Encompasses entertainment stemming from novel ideas, often seen in high-concept pieces.

4. **Entertainment through Twists (Manipulation/Psychology)**: Focuses on entertainment derived from intriguing forms of audience manipulation, commonly found in mystery and thriller genres.

This structure helps in understanding the potential impact of different genres and themes on audiences, providing a comprehensive tool for authors and storytellers to craft narratives with specific desired impacts.


### EXAMPLE 1:
The excerpt is discussing the complexities of the Dramatica theory of storytelling which categorizes narratives based on four different criteria: universe/situation, activity/physics, mindset/fixed attitude, and manipulation/psychology. It highlights how these categories can be molded to create different narrative genres: information (documentary, educational, inspirational), drama (courtroom, crime, obsession dramas), comedy (sitcoms, slapstick, comedy of manners), and entertainment (fantasy, action adventure, thrillers).

Here's a more detailed explanation and summary of each part of the excerpt:

### Part 1:
This part of the excerpt outlines various genres and modes of storytelling, dividing them into four main categories based on the focus and method of storytelling:

1. Information:
   - Universe: Historical documentaries or period pieces analyzing events or situations.
   - Physics: Educational or instructional content explaining processes.
   - Mind: Inspirational content exploring opinions and points of view.
   - Psychology: Propaganda or persuasion, examining value systems.
   
2. Drama:
   - Universe: Dramas exploring imbalances in the "state of things."
   - Physics: Dramas focusing on issues arising from ongoing activities.
   - Mind: Dramas concentrating on conflicts stemming from incompatible attitudes.
   - Psychology: Dramas revolving around manipulative attempts to overcome difficulties.

3. Comedy:
   - Universe: Comedies deriving humor from situational predicaments.
   - Physics: Physical comedies utilizing slapstick or pratfalls.
   - Mind: Comedies of manners, highlighting divergent attitudes or biases.
   - Psychology: Comedy of errors, utilizing misinterpretation or attribution errors for humor.

4. Entertainment:
   - Universe: Genres using unique or interesting settings to entertain.
   - Physics: Genres providing thrills through new or unique activities.
   - Mind: Genres presenting new or interesting ideas for entertainment.
   - Psychology: Genres using audience manipulation techniques for entertainment.

### Part 2:
In this section, the theory suggests that a well-rounded story can contain a blend of different genres and throughlines, providing a more engaging and emotionally diverse experience for the audience. A balanced narrative would incorporate elements of information, drama, comedy, and entertainment, potentially using different throughlines for the overall story, main character, impact character, and subjective story relationship. The narrative can be more dynamic and immersive by carefully selecting throughlines based on intuition and feelings.

### Part 3:
This section introduces the concept of "Progressive Appreciation of Genre", explaining that a throughline in a story can dynamically change and adopt different modes of expression as the story unfolds. However, these shifts should adhere to a natural progression to maintain consistency and emotional coherence. It warns against abrupt shifts in genre modes as it can disrupt the narrative flow, using the film "Hudson Hawke" as a negative example.

### Part 4:
This part further expands on the "Progressive Appreciation of Genre", illustrating that the modes of expression in a story can cycle seamlessly, creating a varied and unique narrative genre by the end of the story. It proposes a visualization where the table of class/modes of expression forms a cylinder, allowing for a smooth transition between different modes, and offering a rich and complex narrative structure.

Overall, the Dramatica theory presents a multifaceted approach to narrative structure, encouraging variety and depth in storytelling through the skillful manipulation of genres and throughlines. It offers a framework for writers to craft narratives with a nuanced and desired impact on the audience.
# Section 2: The Art of Storytelling
In this excerpt, the author explores the intricacies of storytelling from the perspective of the "Dramatica" theory. Here's a concise summary and clarification of the key points presented:

### **Summary:**

The excerpt delves deep into the theory of storytelling as detailed in the "Dramatica" method, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between a story's structure (comprising elements like character, theme, plot, and genre) and its presentation. The narrative journey is delineated into four significant stages: Storyforming, Storyencoding, Storyweaving, and Reception. Each stage plays a vital role in the development and communication of a story, allowing for a thorough process where both the author and the audience actively participate in crafting and interpreting the narrative. 

### **Clarification:**

1. **Storyforming**: This initial stage focuses on establishing the primary structure of the story, defining the core elements like the theme, plot, genre, and characters. Here, the intrinsic meaning that the author intends to communicate is conceived.

2. **Storyencoding**: In this stage, the author selects appropriate symbols and narrative devices to represent the core elements established in the storyforming stage. It is crucial because it helps in translating the abstract concepts into tangible and interpretable entities.

3. **Storyweaving**: This is the phase where the encoded elements are intricately interwoven to create a cohesive narrative. The author decides on the order and the emphasis of the various components, which significantly influence the audience's experience and perception of the story. This stage provides flexibility to the author in terms of narrative style and presentation, such as beginning the story at different points in the narrative timeline.

4. **Reception**: This final stage centers on the audience's role in interpreting and understanding the story. The audience decodes the symbols and constructs meaning from the presented narrative, which might sometimes diverge from the author's original intent based on their individual perspectives and preconceptions.

Furthermore, the text emphasizes the necessity for the author to adopt both creator and audience perspectives, allowing for a holistic approach to storytelling that ensures narrative coherence and effectiveness. It also suggests that using the Dramatica model, which provides a structured view of story dynamics, can help authors maintain a balanced approach to storytelling, ensuring that the emphasis on different narrative aspects aligns with their intentions. However, it cautions against over-reliance on the audience perspective, which might obscure specific details necessary for a well-rounded story.

This section of the text prepares readers to transition from understanding the structural elements of storytelling to exploring the nuances of the art of storytelling, indicating a shift towards more detailed insights into the communication processes involved in narrating a story.

## Stage 1: Storyforming

### Introduction to Storyforming
This text is an excerpt from "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" discussing the stages and considerations an author undergoes in the process of developing a story. Here’s a summarized and clarified version of the text:

### **Journey of Story Creation**

#### **Finding Inspiration**
In the initial stage of crafting a story, an author might not have a clear picture of the entire narrative. The inspiration to start writing might come from various small elements like an action scene, dialogue, or even just a title. This inspiration might be derived from a personal emotion, experience, or a particular perspective on a subject. The creative process tends to evolve, where one idea leads to another, gradually expanding the initial concept into a complex tapestry of interconnected elements.

#### **Shaping the Structure**
As the narrative expands, the author transitions from being a creator to an analyst, scrutinizing the emerging story to develop a comprehensive structure. They need to visualize the broader picture considering four critical aspects: character, theme, plot, and genre. They have to refine character perspectives, fill logical gaps, and foster a cohesive theme throughout the narrative. Although elements of a story are present, the author needs to meticulously refine these fragments to form a complete, well-rounded story.

#### **Refinement Process**
During the refinement process, the author identifies inconsistencies and gaps that need to be addressed to develop a unified story. This includes removing out-of-place items and filling evident gaps to create a narrative that flows seamlessly. The goal is to craft a story that transcends its individual parts, embodying a unique identity.

#### **Communication and Storytelling**
The finished story comprises two primary components: the underlying structure, referred to as the "Storyform," and the expressive component, termed "Storytelling." While the storyform is the foundational structure determining the narrative's logistics, storytelling is the creative expression that brings life to this structure. This phase highlights the distinction between the core narrative (Storyform) and its representation (Storytelling), showcasing how the same foundational structure can be presented in varying manners, akin to different tenants occupying and personalizing the same apartment space over time.

#### **Navigating Challenges**
An essential insight shared is the intertwined nature of storyform and storytelling, which can sometimes complicate the refinement process. Authors might struggle to pinpoint the exact areas needing adjustment, hindered by their personal biases and assumptions. To alleviate this, the author can consider starting with establishing a solid storyform, outlining the essential emotional and logical aspects to ensure a cohesive and consistent foundation, before diving into the storytelling aspect. This approach necessitates a thoughtful consideration of the topics to be explored and the intended impact on the audience, potentially preventing challenges that might arise later in the development process.
