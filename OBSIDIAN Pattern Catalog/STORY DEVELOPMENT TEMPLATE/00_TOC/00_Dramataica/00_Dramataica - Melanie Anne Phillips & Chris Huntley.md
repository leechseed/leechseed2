# Dramatica & the Creative Writer
The provided text is an excerpt from a book discussing the "Dramatica" theory of story, which divides the craft of writing into two main facets: structure and storytelling. Here is a summarized and clarified version of the text:

## Summary and Clarification

#### **Introduction to Dramatica**

The book proposes to guide readers in mastering the art of writing through the Dramatica theory, which examines both structure and style in the craft of storytelling. This approach seeks to educate rather than inspire, allowing a deeper exploration into each aspect of writing which are traditionally blended in the creative process. It emphasizes that effective communication is a crucial aspect of this process, necessitating clear transmission of information or feelings from the author (originator) to the audience (recipient).

#### **Audience Participation in Storytelling**

The audience is an active participant in storytelling, often creating additional layers of meaning from the narrative based on their personal experiences and interpretations. The narrative doesn't have to contain explicit details, as a simple phrase can evoke a rich tapestry of memories and emotions in the audience, creating a subjective experience.

#### **Grand Argument Stories**

The text introduces the concept of the "Grand Argument Story," which is defined as a comprehensive narrative that presents a complete argument, encompassing all possible perspectives on an issue while highlighting one approach as the optimal solution. This is not meant to diminish other forms of storytelling but to delineate this specific category. The Grand Argument Story is analyzed through various elements including structure, dynamics, character, theme, plot, and genre. These elements, described in detail, interlink to form a "Storyform", a blueprint that reveals the intricate relationships and arrangements that create a cohesive narrative.

#### **Free-form Authoring and Scope of Dramatica**

While some authors adhere to structured storytelling to present a comprehensive argument, others indulge in free-form writing to explore personal experiences or insights, sometimes without a clear intent. The Dramatica theory, although focused on the Grand Argument Story, can encompass other forms of communication since it illustrates all possible ways to examine an issue, encompassing various "slices" or "chunks" of the model. This theory holds that universally shared essential concepts, albeit interpreted differently across cultures and individuals, facilitate communication.

#### **Symbolization and Communication**

The process of communication entails the symbolization of concepts, translating them into words or actions that may become culturally specific and subject to diverse interpretations. This also highlights the challenge of conveying the author's intent accurately, as the symbols used may invoke different reactions based on the cultural background of the audience.

#### **Author's Intent and Use of Dramatica**

Being an author involves the intention to communicate. However, authors often struggle to integrate their individual inspirations into a unified story, either resulting in formulaic works or chaotic narratives. Dramatica serves as a tool to guide authors in shaping their narrative, helping identify the elements that align with their story's intent and those that don't. It can be used at different stages of the writing process, aiding both structured and free-form authors in honing their craft. It also assists in understanding the impact of diverging from traditional storytelling structures on audience reception.

#### **Book Structure and Application of Dramatica**

The book is divided into two major sections that delve into the components of a story (Character, Theme, Plot, and Genre) and the stages of communication between the author and the audience (Storyforming, Storyencoding, Storyweaving, and Reception). It aims to equip readers with a comprehensive understanding of storytelling and tools to enhance their writing skills. The authors note their background in the motion picture industry and clarify that Dramatica is a universal theory of story, not restricted to any specific medium.

#### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, Dramatica serves as a valuable tool for authors, offering insights into the process of communication and storytelling, whether they choose to adhere to structured narratives or explore a more free-form approach. It allows for a deeper understanding of the intricacies of story development and the role of audience interpretation in the storytelling process.
# Section 1: The Elements of Structure

## Foundations
The excerpt outlines the central concepts of Dramatica, a theory of story development. Here is a clarification and summarization of the concepts and ideas presented:

### Clarification:

1. **The Story Mind**:
   - **Concept**: Every complete story mimics the mind's problem-solving process. 
   - **Function**: Presents a holistic approach to understanding and addressing issues, wherein various conflicting perspectives are brought together to give a story its meaning. 

2. **The Four Throughlines**:
   - **Concept**: These are perspectives or lenses through which a story is viewed to give a comprehensive understanding of the problem at the center of the story. 
   - **Function**: Helps in presenting a well-rounded argument, guiding the audience not only on what to observe but also how to perceive it, establishing a connection between the object and the observer.

3. **Individual Throughlines**:
   - **Overall Story Throughline**: A detached view of the story, focusing on unfolding strategies and larger events, often associated with the plot.
   - **Main Character Throughline**: A more personal perspective, where audiences empathize with the main character and experience events at a close range.
   - **Impact Character Throughline**: Illustrates the presence of a character who brings a different approach to the problem, impacting the main character's path.
   - **Subjective Story Throughline**: Depicts the intense interaction and conflict between the main and the impact characters.
   
4. **Grand Argument Story**:
   - **Concept**: A comprehensive narrative developed by integrating all four throughlines, thereby crafting an argument that explores all facets of the central problem.
   - **Function**: Offers a multifaceted reflection of human cognition in problem-solving, showcasing the dynamics between reason, emotion, immediate advantages, and experiences.
   
5. **Other Aspects**:
   - **Characters, Plot, Theme, and Genre**: These elements are tangible manifestations of various considerations in the Story Mind. 
      - **Characters**: Represent motivations that may conflict with each other.
      - **Plot**: Illustrates the problem-solving methods used.
      - **Theme**: Examines the relative values and standards.
      - **Genre**: Establishes the overall attitude or background tone.

### Summary:

Dramatica is a story theory that proposes a comprehensive approach to understanding and crafting narratives. It introduces the concept of the "Story Mind", a representation of a mind engaging in problem-solving, which is developed through various tangible aspects like characters, plot, theme, and genre. The theory emphasizes four perspectives, termed as throughlines: Overall, Main Character, Impact Character, and Subjective Story Throughlines, each offering different viewpoints on the central problem.

Through these throughlines, the author creates a grand argument, which serves as an exploration of various facets of the central issue, providing a rich and multifaceted narrative that engages the audience holistically. Examples from well-known stories like "Star Wars" and "To Kill A Mockingbird" illustrate these concepts in action, demonstrating the interplay between various characters and narrative threads to build a complex, complete story.

As you move forward, these concepts will serve as foundational elements in your exploration of Dramatica's Theory of Story, enriching your understanding and capabilities in story crafting.


## Character
### Introduction to Character

**Clarification**:

In this passage, the writer discusses the different types of central characters in a story - the Main Character, the Protagonist, and the Hero - as defined by the Dramatica theory of story. 

1. **Main Character**: The individual through whom the audience personally experiences the story.
2. **Protagonist**: The person who drives the story's plot forward.
3. **Hero**: A character that embodies both the qualities of the Main Character and the Protagonist, serving as a point of connection for the audience and advancing the story's plot.

The text also introduces the concept of the "Story Mind", which is perceived in two views: the Overall Story view and the Subjective view. The Overall Story view is an outsider's perspective where characters are identified by their roles in the plot. In contrast, the Subjective view embodies the internal conflict within the story, primarily illustrated through the interactions of Main and Impact characters. These different views help in creating rich, complex narratives and more realistic characters. The subsequent chapters seem to promise a deeper analysis of these concepts.

**Summary**:

The excerpt presents an introduction to character development in storytelling, emphasizing the distinction between a Main Character, a Protagonist, and a Hero as delineated by Dramatica theory. It highlights the limited scope of considering the central character as merely a hero and promotes the separation of the roles of Main Character and Protagonist for a nuanced narrative, as illustrated with the example from "To Kill a Mockingbird". Moreover, it introduces the concept of "Story Mind", proposing two views - Overall Story and Subjective - that offer different perspectives in story analysis: one focusing on the external functions of characters and the other representing the internal viewpoints and conflicts within a narrative. The passage indicates that upcoming sections will delve deeper into understanding these concepts, exploring the functionalities of different character archetypes and how they influence story development.
### Overall Story Characters
#### Clarification and Summary:

**Introduction to Archetypes**

Archetypes are a kind of shorthand in storytelling that authors use to quickly convey character traits and roles in a story. They may be used to save time, emphasize other story elements, or leverage audience familiarity with certain character types. Archetypes can be both advantageous due to their simplicity and disadvantageous if they are not sufficiently developed. There are eight archetypal characters outlined: Protagonist, Antagonist, Reason, Emotion, Sidekick, Skeptic, Guardian, and Contagonist.

**Players and Characters**

In the Dramatica theory, a character is defined as a set of dramatic functions necessary to make a complete argument in a story, while a player represents these functions, often embodying multiple characters, akin to multiple personalities in one entity. This phenomenon can be observed in characters like Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.

**Character Descriptions**

1. **Protagonist**: The central figure driving the effort to achieve the story's goal. They are usually paired with the Main Character role, making their depiction richer in the narrative.
   
2. **Antagonist**: The force opposing the protagonist's goal. They may also embody the Impact Character, representing an alternate belief system in the subjective story, challenging the Main Character's approach to their personal problem.
   
3. **Reason**: This character operates based on logic and rational decisions, sometimes at the expense of ignoring personal emotions and considerations.
   
4. **Emotion**: A character driven by feelings, often exhibiting frenetic and disorganized behavior, representing the heart in the intellectual versus emotional deliberation in the story's mind.
   
5. **Sidekick**: A loyal supporter, usually of the protagonist, representing faith and support in the story's narrative.
   
6. **Skeptic**: A doubter who opposes the sidekick's faith and support, portraying doubts and potential failure indicators in the story.
   
7. **Guardian**: A helper or teacher character embodying the conscience, helping guide the protagonist towards success.
   
8. **Contagonist**: A unique archetype in Dramatica that serves to hinder the protagonist's progress, either by delaying or diverting them, representing temptation in the story's mind.

These archetypes function together to form a balanced and complete argument in a story, providing different perspectives and dimensions to the narrative. They can be aligned in different ways to add complexity and depth to their relationships.

### Complex Characters
**Summary:**

The text discusses the concepts of archetypal and complex characters in storytelling. Archetypal characters embody cohesive, harmonious traits, making them predictable and possibly less human-like. On the other hand, complex characters exhibit more nuanced, conflicting traits, offering deeper exploration and resembling real humans more closely. Characters are defined by their functions or elements which can be combined in various ways to create either archetypal or complex characters.

The text also introduces the idea of "Dynamic Pairs", which are pairs of archetypal characters representing different facets of the human mind grappling with a problem. These pairs embody conflicts such as desire versus avoidance, reason versus emotion, and faith versus disbelief. In a story, characters can be categorized as "Drivers" or "Passengers", where drivers are primary forces moving the plot forward, and passengers represent different approaches and attitudes towards the problem without directly driving the plot. Examples of drivers are the protagonist, antagonist, guardian, and contagonist, and examples of passengers are the sidekick, reason, emotion, and skeptic.

---

**Clarification:**

1. **Complex Characters**: These characters have traits and functions that are not internally compatible, making them more layered and resembling real humans closely as they embody our inconsistencies. 
   
2. **Archetypal Characters**: These characters group together similar and compatible functions, which means they don't have internal conflicts in their nature. They are easier to understand but might appear less developed compared to complex characters.

3. **Dynamic Pairs**: These are pairs of archetypal characters that represent different aspects of the human mindset when addressing a problem. The pairs embody opposing traits or approaches and signify the internal conflict a mind experiences while facing a problem.

4. **Drivers and Passengers**: In a story, characters can be classified as drivers or passengers. "Drivers" are the primary forces that propel the plot forward, actively influencing the outcomes. "Passengers", on the other hand, influence the drivers and represent various approaches or attitudes towards the problem but do not directly impact the progression of the plot.

5. **Character Elements**: These are the fundamental building blocks of a character, defining their role and nature in a story. Understanding these elements helps in developing characters that can either be archetypal or complex, depending on how these elements are combined and portrayed.

### Drivers and Passengers in "Star Wars," "The Wizard of Oz," & "Jaws"

In this text, the concept of "Drivers" and "Passengers" in the context of storytelling is discussed using examples from popular movies like "Star Wars," "The Wizard of Oz," and "Jaws." Here is a summarized and clarified version of the information:

#### Overview

In storytelling, characters can be classified into two primary groups: Drivers and Passengers. These classifications help in understanding the characters' roles and their impact on the progression of the story.

- **Drivers**: These are characters who are the prime movers in the story, significantly influencing the course of events.
- **Passengers**: These characters, on the other hand, are more reactive and represent different approaches and attitudes towards the central problem of the story, but do not primarily drive the story forward.

#### Examples:

1. #### **Star Wars**
    - **Driver Characters**:
        - **Protagonist (Luke Skywalker)**: The central figure driving the goal of the story.
        - **Antagonist (The Empire)**: Opposes the goal of destroying the Death Star.
        - **Guardian (Obi-Wan Kenobi)**: Provides protection and moral guidance.
        - **Contagonist (Darth Vader)**: Represents temptation and hinders progress.
    - **Passenger Characters**:
        - **Sidekick (R2D2 and C3PO)**: Faithful supporters.
        - **Reason (Princess Leia)**: The logical and planner figure.
        - **Emotion (Chewbacca)**: Acts based on feelings.
        - **Skeptic (Han Solo)**: Continually questions and opposes actions proposed by others.

    - **Driver Characters**:
        - **Protagonist (Dorothy)**: Main character embarking on a journey.
        - **Antagonist (Wicked Witch)**: Opposes Dorothy, although not perfectly fitting the archetype.
        - **Guardian (Glinda)**: Offers guidance and protection.
        - **Contagonist (Wizard)**: A controversial figure, with ambiguous moral positioning.
    - **Passenger Characters**:
        - **Sidekick (Toto)**: Loyal companion to Dorothy.
        - **Reason (Scarecrow)**: Acts as a planner, albeit not calmly.
        - **Emotion (Tin Man)**: Displays emotional responses, though not frenzied.
        - **Skeptic (Cowardly Lion)**: Shows doubt and fear.
![[Pasted image 20230908033120.png]]
3. #### **Jaws**
    - **Driver Characters**:
        - **Protagonist (Chief Brody)**: Main character attempting to address the shark problem.
        - **Antagonist (Shark)**: The force opposing Brody's efforts.
        - **Guardian/Reason (Hooper)**: Provides moral guidance and adopts a rational approach, playing a dual role.
        - **Contagonist/Skeptic (Mayor)**: Hinders progress and expresses doubt, also playing a dual role.
    - **Passenger Characters**:
        - **Sidekick (Brody's Wife)**: A secondary character providing support.
        - **Emotion (Quint)**: Acts based on intense feelings towards sharks.
![[Pasted image 20230908033130.png]]
### Insights:

- Characters in a story may not always fit perfectly into archetypal molds, and can exhibit characteristics of complex characters, demonstrating more nuanced behaviors and motivations.
- Identifying and analyzing these roles can provide deeper insights into the dynamics of a story and the complexities of the characters involved.
- The process helps in understanding how different characters contribute to the overall narrative and the conflicts that drive the story forward.

### Action and Decision Elements of Drivers and Passengers
The text elaborates on archetypal characters typically found in narratives, further dissecting these archetypes into elements pertaining to their actions and decisions, which helps in analyzing characters in movies like The Wizard of Oz and Jaws. 

Initially, a brief recap is given, outlining eight primary archetypal characters as follows:

1. **Protagonist**: The main driver of the story who forces the action and seeks success.
2. **Antagonist**: The character opposing the protagonist, representing the primary obstacle to the protagonist's success.
3. **Reason**: A character who operates based on logic and rationality, devoid of emotional influence.
4. **Emotion**: A character who acts on feelings without considering practical implications.
5. **Skeptic**: This character doubts everything, including plans, sincerity, and truth.
6. **Sidekick**: A character that remains loyally supportive, often aligned with the protagonist or antagonist.
7. **Guardian**: A helper or teacher who aids the protagonist and embodies a moral standard.
8. **Contagonist**: A character who obstructs the protagonist, tempting them to choose the wrong path.

Subsequently, these archetypes are split into action and decision characteristics to provide a more nuanced analysis:

1. **Protagonist**
   - Action: Pursues the goal actively.
   - Decision: Encourages others to realize the necessity of the goal.

2. **Antagonist**
   - Action: Physically tries to hinder the protagonist's success.
   - Decision: Encourages others to rethink the attempt to achieve the goal.

3. **Guardian**
   - Action: Aids in achieving the story goal.
   - Decision: Represents moral conscience.

4. **Contagonist**
   - Action: Hinders efforts to achieve the story goal.
   - Decision: Represents the temptation to choose the incorrect approach.

5. **Reason**
   - Action: Has controlled actions.
   - Decision: Makes decisions based on logic.

6. **Emotion**
   - Action: Has frenzied or uncontrolled actions.
   - Decision: Makes decisions based on feelings, disregarding practicality.

7. **Sidekick**
   - Action: Supports and cheers on.
   - Decision: Has an almost gullible faith in the goal or protagonist.

8. **Skeptic**
   - Action: Opposes everything.
   - Decision: Doubts everything.

Further, these split characteristics are organized into quadrants — Driver and Passenger Quads — which give a visual representation of the motivations driving these archetypal characters. In Dramatica theory, these 16 characteristics are referred to as the "Motivation Elements," illustrating what propels the archetypal characters in a story.

![[Pasted image 20230908033339.png]]

### The 16 Motivation Elements in "Star Wars," "The Wizard of Oz," & "Jaws"
This long passage discusses a framework to analyze the depth and complexity of characters in narratives, particularly focusing on the sixteen motivation elements that drive characters and their decisions and actions.

#### Clarification and Summary

##### Summary:

The text breaks down characters into various archetypes based on their roles, actions, and decisions in the storyline. These archetypes can further be split into two characteristics: action and decision. These characteristics can be used to analyze the complexity of characters in well-known stories such as Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz, and Jaws. The sixteen motivation elements offer a tool to dissect character complexities further than the basic archetypal categorization, allowing for the analysis of their inner conflicts and deeper motivations.

##### Clarification:

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the information provided in the text:

1. **Archetypal Characters and Their Roles**:
    - Protagonist: Drives the story forward, encouraging others to prioritize the goal.
    - Antagonist: Opposes the protagonist, trying to prevent the goal from being achieved.
    - Guardian: Aids the protagonist, representing moral standards based on the author's viewpoint.
    - Contagonist: Hinders the protagonist, tempting them to stray from the right path.
    - Reason: Makes decisions based on logic, with a controlled approach to actions.
    - Emotion: Makes decisions based on feelings, with an uncontrolled approach to actions.
    - Sidekick: Supports the protagonist faithfully, showing extreme faith in the goal or protagonist.
    - Skeptic: Doubts everything, opposing actions and beliefs constantly.

2. **Analysis of Classic Movies**:
    - **Star Wars**: The characteristics of the archetypes are well aligned with the roles of characters like Luke (Protagonist), Obi-Wan (Guardian), Darth Vader (Contagonist), and others.
![[Pasted image 20230908033844.png]]
    - **The Wizard of Oz**: The character analysis indicates a swap in the characteristics of some archetypes (like the Tin Man and Scarecrow) creating complex, conflicted characters. The Witch and the Wizard also display swapped elements, diverging from traditional archetypes.
![[Pasted image 20230908033919.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230908033935.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230908034013.png]]
    - **Jaws**: The character roles and characteristics align well with the proposed archetypes, with characters like Brody fitting the protagonist role perfectly.
![[Pasted image 20230908034033.png]]
3. **Grouping the 16 Motivation Elements**:
    - The sixteen elements can be grouped into four quads based on whether they pertain to action or decision, and whether they are driver or passenger elements.
    - The grouping of these elements in quads helps to deepen the understanding of character motivations and their relationships.

4. **Using the Quads to Gain Meaning**:
    - The framework can be used to create complex characters by assigning elements in non-traditional patterns, enabling the creation of rich and sophisticated characters in stories.
    - Characters are multi-dimensional, influenced by motivations, purposes, methodologies, and evaluation means. The discussion hints at exploring more complex arrangements of character elements in subsequent sections.

This framework provides a method for dissecting character complexities, offering a comprehensive lens to analyze and understand the motivations and roles of characters in narratives.
### The 16 Motivation Elements in "The Wizard of Oz" & "Jaws"
This text explores the complex characterization found in "The Wizard of Oz" and "Jaws" through the lens of the Dramatica theory, a theory that breaks down characters into a set of motivation elements, helping to create multi-faceted, nuanced characters.

In the section discussing "The Wizard of Oz", the main characters are analyzed based on a set of motivation elements, where it notes a departure from archetypal roles. The Scarecrow and Tin Man, in particular, demonstrate complex characteristics; Scarecrow combines logic with an uncontrolled approach, whereas the Tin Man pairs feelings with control, creating an interesting internal conflict in each of these characters. This depth adds a level of complexity to their personas. The Witch and the Wizard, meanwhile, diverge from the traditional Archetypal molds, undergoing a different kind of "swapping" of elements that add layers to their characters. In the Quad formation, not all characters adhere strictly to the archetypal roles, showing a richer characterization.
![[Pasted image 20230909203028.png]]
In the "Jaws" segment, characters are also dissected based on these motivational elements. Brody, the protagonist, embodies the attributes of "pursue" and "consideration", actively working towards achieving his goal. Other characters, like Hooper and the Mayor, exhibit different combinations of elements, adding depth to their roles within the story. Hooper, for example, embodies a role of conscience and logic, but with an uncontrolled approach, making his character more intricate and possibly unpredictable.
![[Pasted image 20230909203035.png]]
Overall, the sections of the text explore how utilizing a combination of different motivational elements can create more complex and nuanced characters in storytelling, diverging from simple archetypal roles to create characters with depth and internal conflict, making for a richer narrative experience. It's a part of the broader approach of the Dramatica theory, aiming to understand and craft stories with intricate character developments and relationships.
### Grouping the 16 Motivation Elements
In the provided text, the Dramatica theory of story is discussed, emphasizing a more nuanced approach to organizing character elements beyond the traditional eight archetypal character types. This evolved approach breaks down character traits into 16 separate motivation elements, grouped into four quads: Action Driver Quad, Decision Driver Quad, Action Passenger Quad, and Decision Passenger Quad. Each of these quads comprises four characteristics, allowing for a more detailed and granulated analysis of character motivations and actions.

The text further explains how utilizing these quads can offer deeper insight into character relationships and dynamics. By examining characters through the lens of these quads, it helps in understanding the distinct roles and functions of different characters, such as the protagonist and the guardian, in a story. This approach provides a framework to understand how different characters, with specific drives like 'Pursue' or 'Help', interact and relate to each other, facilitating the crafting of complex narratives.

Furthermore, the text hints at the limitation of solely using these 16 motivation elements to develop characters as it only represents one dimension of character complexity, specifically the "Motivation" dimension. Characters in sophisticated stories, similar to real people, are also influenced by their purposes, the methodologies they employ to achieve those purposes, and the means they use to evaluate their efforts, forming a four-dimensional character model. The subsequent sections of the text are anticipated to delve into how to effectively rearrange these motivation elements and introduce other dimensions of character complexity to craft fully realized, four-dimensional characters.

![[Pasted image 20230909203252.png]]
### "Star Wars," "Oz," & "Jaws" Characters in Four Motivation Quads

In this excerpt, the Dramatica theory of story is applied to character analysis in the "Star Wars", "The Wizard of Oz", and "Jaws" narratives, by categorizing characters into four motivation quads: Action Driver Quad, Decision Driver Quad, Action Passenger Quad, and Decision Passenger Quad.

In the "Star Wars" example, the characters perfectly fit into these quads, displaying a symmetrical pattern. Each character possesses both an Action and a Decision characteristic, creating direct oppositions between pairs of characters both internally and externally. These characterizations are seen to fall strictly within either the Driver or the Passenger quads, maintaining a neat alignment with traditional archetypes.
![[Pasted image 20230909203314.png]]
Meanwhile, the characters in "The Wizard of Oz" display a notable variation from the standard archetype through the "flipping" of Logic and Feeling in relation to Control and Uncontrolled characteristics. This adjustment generates characters with conflicting attributes, resulting in more complex and versatile personalities. Specifically, the Wizard and the Wicked Witch's characters deviate from the typical molds, showcasing more depth and less stereotypical traits, which influence the narrative dynamics and audience expectations significantly.
![[Pasted image 20230909203308.png]]
Lastly, in the "Jaws" analysis, the character setups in the Driver quad mirror those found in "Star Wars", with simple and straightforward characteristics. However, an interesting phenomenon is observed in the Passenger quad, where certain characters (like the Mayor and Hooper) embody multiple characteristics, spanning both Driver and Passenger traits. This complex configuration results in these characters having more intricate interactions and conflicts compared to archetypal characters, categorizing them as "Complex Characters".
![[Pasted image 20230909203321.png]]
In essence, the passage explores how restructuring character elements, by employing the four motivation quads, can create multi-layered characters that not only add depth to the narrative but also foster more intricate and engaging story developments.

### Complex Motivation Characteristics
In this excerpt from the Dramatica theory of story, the discussion revolves around the rules and nuances of combining different characteristics to create complex and nuanced characters in a story.

Initially, the rule highlighted is that a character should not embody both characteristics in a Dynamic Pair simultaneously as it contradicts the principle of the "Story Mind" analogy, illustrating the logical inconsistency of being both for and against something at the same time. However, it also introduces the concept of a "player" who can portray multiple characters (each with different characteristics) but only one at a time, essentially switching roles as required. This method allows for a wide range of characteristics to be exhibited by a single entity, as long as they don't represent opposing traits concurrently.

Furthermore, the theory accepts the inclusion of conflicting characteristics within one entity, as seen in the case of characters with split personalities, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In such scenarios, a player can choose a diverse set of characteristics but must avoid selecting opposing elements from a Dynamic Pair to maintain coherence and avoid internal conflict.

Looking at character growth, the excerpt distinguishes between the objective and subjective aspects of characters. Objectively, characters embody fixed problem-solving processes and remain consistent in their innate dispositions throughout the story. Subjectively, they can exhibit growth as their perspectives and learned behaviors evolve over the course of the narrative. 

For authors, this theory underscores the importance of thoughtful distribution of the 16 motivations among characters to craft a cohesive and compelling story. It warns against the repetition of characteristics, which can muddle the storyline, and the omission of characteristics, which can create gaps in the story's argument. Despite these guidelines, the theory encourages authors to exploit the flexibility within these rules to create unique and engaging characters that fulfill the audience's expectations of a well-rounded story mind. It suggests a balanced approach, where authors can construct unique and memorable characters while adhering to the logical and comprehensive representation of motivations within the story mind framework.

### Complex Characters in "Gone With the Wind," & "Rear Window"

This text discusses the analysis of characters and their motivations in two famous works, "Gone with the Wind" and "Rear Window", based on the theory posited in the book "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" by Screenplay Systems Inc. 

##### Gone with the Wind

###### Overview
The analysis starts by mentioning the depth of the plot in "Gone with the Wind" and indicates that the character complexity is comparable to other stories discussed before. The characters are analyzed based on their motivations and characteristics.

###### Main Characters and Characteristics
- **Scarlett O'Hara:** Characterized as "PURSUE" and "CONSIDERATION" due to her persistent nature in pursuing various objectives and making others reconsider their standpoints.
- **Rhett Butler:** Identified as "AVOID" and "RECONSIDERATION" since he mostly steers clear of getting involved directly and tends to make others rethink their actions.
- **Ashley Wilkes:** Defined as representing "TEMPTATION" and "HINDER", embodying temptation for Scarlett, even though indirectly, and often jeopardizes Scarlett's situations.
- **Melanie Wilkes:** She embodies "CONSCIENCE" and "HELP", often advising Scarlett and fixing the problems created by her.

##### Character Pairings
The text emphasizes the thoughtful pairings of characters, who complement or oppose each other in terms of their characteristics, creating a rich narrative dynamics.

##### Rear Window

###### Overview
The analysis transitions to discussing the more complex characters of "Rear Window", a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It narrows down the important characters to five: Jeffries, Lisa, Doyle, the Nurse, and Thorwald.

###### Main Characters and Characteristics
- **Jeffries:** His characteristics are "FAITH", "CONSIDERATION", "UNCONTROLLED", and "PURSUE". He believes in the occurrence of a murder and urges others to consider the possibility despite lacking logical arguments.
- **Lisa:** Represents "TEMPTATION", "SUPPORT", and "FEELING". She supports Jeffries but acts impulsively and sometimes hinders his efforts.
- **Doyle:** Characterized by "DISBELIEF" and "LOGIC", he dismisses Jeffries' suspicions, demanding logical explanations for them.
- **Nurse:** Portrays "CONSCIENCE" and "OPPOSE", providing a moral compass and opposing Jeffries' endeavours.
- **Thorwald:** His traits are "RECONSIDERATION", "CONTROL", and "AVOID". His actions encourage reconsideration of beliefs, and he prefers to avoid confrontation.

### Other Character Dimensions

This text discusses a theory of character development from the work "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" where characters in storytelling are considered to have four critical dimensions that define them: Motivation, Methodology, Evaluation, and Purpose. Let's break down each section to clarify and summarize the presented information:

#### Other Character Dimensions What's the Purpose?

##### Summary:
In this section, the difference between a character's purpose and motivation is explained. The purpose refers to the goal that the character wants to achieve, while motivation represents the underlying reason driving them towards that purpose. Understanding both aspects helps in creating a richer character profile as different motivations can lead to different purposes.

##### Clarification:
- Purpose: The objective or goal of the character (e.g., Jane wants to become president).
- Motivation: The underlying drive behind the character's actions or goals (e.g., Jane's childhood lack of control or a desire for an equal rights amendment).

#### Step into the Fourth Dimension....

##### Summary:
This section introduces the Dramatica theory of a character being four-dimensional rather than three-dimensional. Beyond motivation and purpose, a character also needs a methodology, defining the approach they use to achieve their goal, and an evaluation dimension, which refers to the standards they use to measure their progress.

##### Clarification:
- Methodology: The strategies or approaches a character employs to realize their purpose.
- Evaluation: The parameters or standards a character utilizes to assess their progress towards their purpose.

#### All right, Buddy... Where's the conflict?!

##### Summary:
This section exemplifies how conflict can arise between characters even when they share motivations, methodologies, and purposes, but differ in the evaluation dimension. Different evaluation criteria can lead to disagreements and conflicts, making the character interactions more complex and realistic.

##### Clarification:
- Conflict can arise from differing evaluations, despite agreement in other dimensions.
- Characters might have different standards of measuring success, leading to conflicts.

#### The Sixty-Four Element Question
![[Pasted image 20230909203819.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230909203832.png]]
##### Summary:
In this part, the concept of character dimensions is expanded to include a complex system called the "Chess Set," which comprises 64 elements spread across four sets representing each dimension: Purpose, Evaluation, Motivation, and Methodology. These elements further define the nuances in each dimension, providing a detailed framework for character development.

#### Clarification:
- The "Chess Set" is a comprehensive grid containing 64 elements that further detail the four main character dimensions.
- Each set consists of 16 elements that contribute to creating well-rounded characters.

#### Archetypal Characters

##### Summary:
This section hints at the possibility of mapping archetypal characters onto the character elements within the "Chess Set," potentially revealing patterns or archetypes that can be utilized in character creation and development.

##### Clarification:
- The "archetypal pattern" refers to the identifiable traits that can be found when mapping archetypal characters onto the grid of character elements.
- Utilizing the archetypal patterns can provide a structured approach to character creation, taking into account all 64 elements in the "Chess Set." 

I hope this breakdown helps clarify and summarize the complex theory presented in the text!
### Mapping the Archetypal Pattern

In this excerpt from "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story", the authors delve deeply into the intricate process of crafting well-rounded characters in storytelling. Here's a summary and clarification of the texts:

#### Summary:

##### Character Dimensions and Their Importance:
Characters in a story are developed through different dimensions including motivations, purposes, methodologies, and evaluations. Motivation is what drives the character, whereas purpose is what they aim to achieve. Methodology denotes the approaches a character employs to reach their goals, and evaluations are the standards they use to gauge their progress. These dimensions help in adding depth and realism to the characters.

##### Conflict Between Characters:
Conflict can arise between characters even if they agree on several dimensions. The conflict might stem from differences in their evaluations of a situation, as depicted through the example of two business partners with divergent standards for evaluating business success.

##### The Chess Set:
Character dimensions contain sixteen elements each, collectively forming a "Chess Set", a grid that helps to visualize and understand various aspects of character development such as purpose, evaluations, motivations, etc.

![[Pasted image 20230909204141.png]]
##### Archetypal and Complex Dimensional Patterns:
An archetypal pattern is mapped in the motivation set where characters represent opposite motivations, forming dynamic pairs which represent the potential for greatest conflict. The same pattern applies to methodology sets as well. Complex characters may deviate from these archetypal patterns, adopting elements from various dimensions, thus adding versatility to their personalities.

##### Relationships and Conflicts Among Character Elements:
Character elements can have various relationships including dynamic pairs (exact opposites creating potential conflict), companion pairs (compatible yet may have negative impacts), and dependent pairs (complementing each other’s strengths or creating codependency). These relationships offer varied ways to craft conflict and camaraderie between characters. Understanding these relationships is vital in crafting nuanced and layered stories.
![[Pasted image 20230909204155.png]]
#### Clarification:

The text provides a detailed theory on developing complex, well-rounded characters in a story by focusing on four key dimensions: motivation, purpose, methodology, and evaluation. It emphasizes that understanding and utilizing these dimensions can allow for a richer narrative with deep, complex characters. It introduces the concept of the "Chess Set", a tool to map out and understand these dimensions and their various components better. 

Moreover, it emphasizes the significance of crafting relationships between characters judiciously, illustrating how different types of pairs (dynamic, companion, dependent) can create varied dynamics and conflicts in a story. Lastly, it suggests that writers can venture beyond typical archetypes to create characters with multifaceted personalities, thereby offering more depth and complexity to their narratives.
### Subjective Characters

**SUMMARY AND CLARIFICATION**

*Dramatica* introduces a comprehensive theory of character development in storytelling. Here's a breakdown of the core concepts:

1. **Character Dimensions**: Dramatica believes that characters need to be fleshed out across four dimensions to appear fully realized.
    * **Motivation**: Why a character takes action. It's the force that propels them.
    * **Purpose**: The goal or endpoint the character is driven towards.
    * **Methodology**: The approach or tactics a character employs to achieve their purpose.
    * **Evaluation**: The standards or measures a character uses to assess their progress.

2. **Difference between Purpose and Motivation**: Purpose is what the character aims to achieve, while Motivation is the underlying reason why they want to achieve it. For instance, wanting to be president is a Purpose, but the reason behind that aspiration is the Motivation.

3. **The Archetypal Pattern**: 
    * Characters have consistent patterns in their motivations, which can be mapped. Elements diagonally opposite each other are in direct conflict, creating dynamic pairs (e.g., Pursuit and Avoid). 
    * The patterns are consistent across other character dimensions too. For example, a Protagonist driven by 'Pursuit' might use 'Pro-action' as a methodology.

4. **Dynamic, Companion, and Dependent Pairs**: These terms describe relationships between elements and, consequently, characters.
    * **Dynamic Pairs** have elements in opposition, creating conflict.
    * **Companion Pairs** contain elements that are compatible but can either benefit or hinder each other.
    * **Dependent Pairs** are complementary, where each character can bolster the other's weaknesses or become co-dependent.
    * **Components** look at characters in relation to the overall group, focusing either on their individuality or their group identity.

5. **Complex Characters**: While archetypes offer a starting point, characters can be developed more deeply by mixing and matching elements from different dimensions. This creates multifaceted characters that can simultaneously exhibit traits from various archetypes.

6. **In Summary**: Dramatica presents a matrix-like approach to character development, viewing characters across four dimensions and understanding them based on their motivations, purposes, methodologies, and evaluations. By strategically pairing and positioning these elements, writers can craft richer, multi-dimensional characters.
### Deep Theory 
This lengthy passage delves into the mechanics of story-telling and character development, focusing heavily on the journey of a main character and the challenges they encounter in the narrative. The central theme revolves around the concepts of problem-solving and justification, examining how characters navigate their issues and the theoretical underpinnings behind their actions. Below is a more detailed summary and clarification of each section:

#### Deep Theory
This introductory section mentions that the ensuing discussion will explore complex theoretical details about the character development in a narrative. It is geared towards readers interested in an in-depth analysis of storytelling.

#### Problem Solving and Justification
Here, the concept of "Justifications" is introduced. It suggests that characters, like real people, take actions that they believe are justifiable at the moment, even if they may regret them later. The justifications individuals provide can sometimes seem like excuses to others. This ambiguity about what is the "right" action gives rise to the complex dynamics of justification and problem-solving in narratives.

#### The Author Giveth; the Audience Taketh Away
In this section, the role of the author is highlighted. The author builds an argument in the story, proving through the outcomes and judgments in the narrative whether the main character's actions were justified. It emphasizes that in the story, the author's perspective is the objective truth, shaping the audience's understanding and evaluation of the character's actions.

#### Problems Start Innocently Enough
This segment suggests that characters, like real people, are driven by a quest to find joy and alleviate their pain. The difficulties in achieving these objectives arise due to the time it takes to resolve external and internal conflicts, which forms the basis of problem-solving. 

#### Getting to the Heart of the Problem
Here, problem-solving is defined as a gradual process where characters try to address their issues step by step. It highlights the potential for error in identifying the root of the problem and deciding on the course of action, leading to the concepts of justification and problem-solving.

#### Characters, Problems, and Justification
This part introduces the impact character, another central figure in the narrative who contrasts with the main character. The narrative explores the uncertainty in their approaches to solving problems, with one eventually being right (problem-solving) and the other wrong (justification), representing the human dilemma of decision-making in the face of uncertainty.

#### Why We Justify
This segment examines why characters (and people) justify their actions, emphasizing that it is not necessarily a reflection of malintent or stupidity but a reliance on personal life experiences to address current problems. It portrays justifications as a subjective process with uncertain outcomes.

#### Poor, Misguided Souls
In this section, the narrative takes a deeper look at the complex perspectives surrounding a character's actions, demonstrating how different stakeholders might have divergent views on the actions taken by the main and impact characters.

#### Uniqueness Means Never Having to Say, "I Agree"
This segment dives into the inherent conflict generated due to the unique life experiences of characters, which drive them to have incompatible approaches to problem-solving. It discusses the potential for conflicting views on what constitutes problem-solving and justification in a given context.

#### Tell Me A Message, Mommy
This part explains the ultimate purpose of a story: to convey a message, which might challenge or affirm the audience's beliefs. It reveals how the outcome of the story and the judgments passed on the characters' actions create an impact on the audience, potentially influencing their future decisions.

#### Step By Step, Slowly We Argued
In the conclusion, the passage emphasizes the role of the author in crafting a narrative that convinces the audience of their viewpoint, both logically and emotionally. It highlights the need for understanding the nuances of problem-solving and justification to create a compelling, convincing narrative.

#### Clarification:
Overall, this text discusses the complexities of crafting a story, with a focus on character development, problem-solving, and justification. It introduces a rich framework to analyze and build characters, stressing the role of the author in guiding the narrative and influencing the audience's perceptions. The deep theory seeks to dissect the intricate dynamics between the main character and the impact character, their decisions, justifications, and the subsequent outcomes of their actions, creating a narrative that not only entertains but also potentially alters the viewpoints of the audience. It essentially argues that stories serve as a means to explore the gray areas of decision-making and justification, where the right path is not always clear, reflecting the uncertainties faced in real life.

### A Simple Example of Problem Solving
**Summary & Clarification:**

**Main Concept**: 
The text delves into the complexities of problem-solving, justification, and the human tendency to cling to familiar patterns even when they no longer serve our best interests.

**Illustrative Example**:
The story of a waitress with an itching nose is presented. She goes through multiple steps to address her immediate problem (the itch) due to the obstacles she faces, like carrying plates. However, there were simpler solutions she overlooked. The progression of her decisions showcases how one can get caught up in addressing the problems with the solutions rather than directly addressing the initial problem.

**Core Ideas**:

1. **Problem Solving vs. Justification**: The process by which we address problems can sometimes become more complex due to justifications, leading us further away from a straightforward solution. Sometimes our indirect approach to problem-solving can be less efficient, especially when the context changes or under time constraints.
 
2. **Context is Critical**: The appropriateness of a problem-solving method or justification depends heavily on the context. What might work in one situation might be inefficient or inappropriate in another.

3. **Persistence in Old Patterns**: People tend to stick to what they know, even when evidence suggests that a change in approach is necessary. This can be because of the amount of past experience that supports the old approach or because many beliefs are built on foundational assumptions.

4. **Challenging Established Beliefs**: Changing deeply held beliefs or approaches is challenging, especially when these beliefs are foundational. It often requires a significant amount of contrasting evidence or a paradigm shift to change these core beliefs.

5. **Storytelling and Problem Solving**: In stories, characters often grapple with these challenges. They might cling to outdated or ineffective methods of problem-solving because they've lost sight of the original problem or because their approach has always worked in the past.

6. **Associations in Experience**: Over time, individuals create associations based on repeated experiences. These associations, or givens, can sometimes lead us astray, especially when taken out of their original context.

7. **Adapting to New Contexts**: As situations change, old solutions and beliefs might not apply anymore. Recognizing these changes and adapting is crucial, but often difficult due to our inherent resistance to change.

In essence, the text explores the intricate dance between sticking to what we know and adapting to changing contexts. It underscores the importance of re-evaluating our approaches and beliefs, especially when faced with new or evolving challenges.
## The Elements of Structure: Theme
In the presented text, the concept of theme in storytelling is discussed and detailed in the context of the Dramatica theory, a comprehensive theory of story structure.

### Summary:

#### Understanding Theme

According to the text, defining the theme of a story can be challenging, as it embodies different perspectives or angles like mood, message, and premise. It is emphasized that the theme is not independent; rather, it acts as a relationship between the plot and the characters, akin to viewing an object (the plot) from various viewpoints (the characters). This relational aspect makes the theme a complex component to define succinctly. It essentially describes the relationship between what is being looked at (the story's problem) and from where it is being seen (different points of view).

#### Classifying the Story's Problem

The theory also breaks down the problems encountered in a story into different classes: Universe (external situations), Mind (internal attitudes), Physics (external processes), and Psychology (internal processes). These classes are further divided into types that give a more refined perspective on the story's problem, offering both familiar and unfamiliar thematic areas for exploration.

#### Further Resolution and Thematic Topics

At a deeper level, these types are sub-divided into variations, bringing up a richer and more nuanced pool of thematic topics to explore. These variations help pinpoint more precisely the thematic nature of the story's problem, encouraging authors to explore beyond mainstream thematic topics and consider various perspectives on subject matters like love and greed.

#### Integration with Character Elements

Lastly, these variations further disintegrate into character elements, demonstrating that at the core of every thematic issue is character, representing different approaches to solving the story's central problem. This ties the character intricately with the theme, illustrating the depth of relationships in story development.

### Clarification:

1. **Theme as Perspective and Relationship**: The theme in a story is not just about mood, message, or premise, but it also encapsulates different perspectives and relations between the plot and characters. It illustrates the various viewpoints from which a central problem or aspect in a story is viewed.

2. **Classification of Problems**: The Dramatica theory categorizes the problems that are central to a story into four primary classes - Universe, Mind, Physics, and Psychology. Each of these classes can further be broken down to specific types representing more detailed dimensions of the problem.
![[Pasted image 20230909205104.png]]
3. **Variations and Thematic Exploration**: The theory advocates for a deeper exploration of themes by considering various variations that give a nuanced view of the central problem, allowing for fresh thematic explorations beyond mainstream topics.
![[Pasted image 20230909205235.png]]

5. **Theme and Character Integration**: The core of the thematic issue invariably boils down to character elements, illustrating that characters are the central pivot around which the theme evolves, representing different strategies to address the story's problem.

![[Pasted image 20230909205255.png]]

Overall, the text serves as a detailed guide to understanding, classifying, and detailing the theme in a story, presenting it as a multifaceted concept interlinked with characters and central problems in the narrative, thereby offering a rich playground for thematic exploration and storytelling.

![[Pasted image 20230909205402.png]]

In the presented text, the Dramatica theory of storytelling is applied to analyze the narrative of Star Wars, focusing on distinct throughlines - Overall Story, Main Character, Impact Character, and Subjective Story. Below, each concept is summarized and clarified:

### Throughlines:

#### **1.1 Overall Story Throughline:**
- **Aspect:** Activity (Physics)
- **Explanation:** The primary narrative revolves around the physical and military conflict between the Empire and the Rebellion. This story doesn't have a fixed location, but instead, it explores various strategies, battles, and encounters between the two forces.

#### **1.2 Main Character Throughline:**
- **Aspect:** Situation (Universe)
- **Explanation:** This focuses on Luke Skywalker, who is initially perceived as a naive young man from a remote desert planet. Despite his mundane beginnings, he harbors latent talents inherited from his Jedi father, which set the stage for his growth and evolution.

#### **1.3 Impact Character Throughline:**
- **Aspect:** Fixed Attitude (Mind)
- **Explanation:** This throughline centers on Obi-Wan Kenobi, a stalwart believer and practitioner of the Force. His unwavering faith in the Force, coupled with his deep understanding of its light and dark sides, significantly influence the narratives and characters, especially Luke.

#### **1.4 Subjective Story Throughline:**
- **Aspect:** Manipulation (Psychology)
- **Explanation:** This section highlights the manipulative tactics used by Obi-Wan to guide and sometimes coerce Luke into fulfilling his destiny. Through psychological maneuvers and strategic withholding of information, Obi-Wan shapes Luke's journey and decisions.

### **2. Concerns:**

This section elaborates on the principal concerns in each throughline, highlighting actions, progress, impulsive responses, and role-playing as vital elements driving the narrative, character development, and their interactions.

### **3. Issues:**

The issues section discusses the underlying themes explored in each throughline, such as the value of skill, the allure of fantasy, the reevaluation of worth, and the importance of nurturing abilities. These themes play a critical role in character development and the unfolding of the story.

### **4. Problems:**

This segment identifies the fundamental problems or conflicts in each throughline, primarily revolving around tests, trust, proving one's beliefs, and maintaining a balance in relationships. These conflicts drive the narrative and facilitate character growth and transformation.

### **5. Matching Points of View to the Chart:**

Lastly, the text suggests that the theme of a story is a matter of perspective, created by examining a problem and its ramifications from various viewpoints. This approach is an essential tool in crafting a complete and immersive story.

This analysis based on the Dramatica theory provides a structured and detailed examination of the different facets of the Star Wars narrative, dissecting its components to understand the complex interplay of themes, characters, and plot developments.

### Overall Story Throughline
In the excerpt from "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" you've provided, the concept of structuring a complete story using four primary throughlines or perspectives is discussed. These throughlines correspond to four different classes of problems: Situation (Universe), Fixed Attitude (Mind), Activity (Physics), and Manipulation (Psychology). Here's a clarified and summarized version of your text:

#### **Summary and Clarification**

#### **Overview: Setting Up Thematic Perspectives in Story**

To craft a well-rounded story, an author must incorporate four different throughlines, each representing different classes of problems. These throughlines are assigned to different points of view in the story, which helps in laying the foundation for the thematic perspectives in the narrative.

1. **Situation (Universe) Throughline**: This pertains to problems arising from external situations affecting all characters in a story. Depending on its association with a point of view, it could depict a widespread issue like a post-nuclear world or specific personal situations exclusive to the main character, like having a physical deformity.

2. **Activity (Physics) Throughline**: This concerns problems originating from an activity or action that has gone wrong. The activity should be external and could range from a large-scale event to a smaller yet significant issue, like dry rot in a house.

3. **Fixed Attitude (Mind) Throughline**: This class represents issues stemming from internal states, such as fixed attitudes or internal conflicts within a group of people. It could depict a story revolving around prejudice affecting a town or memories haunting a kingdom.

4. **Manipulation (Psychology) Throughline**: This reflects problems arising from the manner of thinking or psychological manipulations. It could depict narratives where the conflict arises from manipulative tactics or clashing thought processes.

#### **Differentiating Between Situation and Activity**

To differentiate between Situation and Activity throughlines, one needs to identify whether the problem stems from having a particular circumstance (situation) or from fighting against or engaging with it (activity). Both these aspects may appear in a story, but one will be highlighted as the primary source of conflict affecting all characters.

#### **Utilizing Throughlines for a Rounded Story**

In crafting a story, the assignment of these throughlines to various points of view (like the Main Character or Overall Story) creates different perspectives and alters how dramatic elements within that class are portrayed. By doing this, the author can depict a range of problems from different angles, offering a richer, more nuanced narrative.

The essence here is that these throughlines help in fleshing out a story by offering different perspectives on the problem at hand, making the narrative more rounded and comprehensive.
### Main Character Throughline
#### Summary and Clarification

The passage discusses the process of defining the "Main Character Throughline" in story writing, which essentially delineates the sphere within which the main character operates. Here's a brief breakdown and clarification of each segment in your text:

#### **Choosing the Main Character Throughline**

The Main Character Throughline is a critical aspect of story crafting as it helps the audience connect with the main character. The throughline is determined based on the class (Situation, Fixed Attitude, Activity, Manipulation) assigned to it, which sets the main character's mindset and shapes their experiences in the narrative. 

#### **Various Classes as Main Character Throughline**

1. **Situation (Universe)**: This class portrays the main character as someone defined by their circumstances or conditions, which might be social, physical, or related to their position in society. It paints a picture of a character ensnared by their specific situation, be it societal status or a physical condition.

2. **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: Here, the main character is depicted as holding a persistent mindset or attitude, which can be a prejudice, a haunting memory, or an unshakeable fixation on someone or something. This fixed mental state is the source of the character's dilemmas and conflicts in the story.

3. **Activity (Physics)**: This category highlights the main character as an action-oriented individual. They might be characterized by their active pursuit of something or their eagerness to understand or learn something. Despite seeming internal, these activities are external applications, differing fundamentally from original, internal thoughts.

4. **Manipulation (Psychology)**: This class signifies a character best described by their manner of thinking. The distinctive element here is the type of mental processes they engage in, rather than the opinions they hold. This throughline provides the audience with an immersive experience into the character's unique way of thinking.

#### **Approach to Developing a Story**

In developing a story, the author might opt to first choose the Main Character Throughline, especially if they are keen on deeply exploring the main character's nature and concerns. However, it's important to remember that once a class is assigned to a throughline (like the Main Character Throughline), it cannot be utilized for other throughlines, thereby establishing distinct boundaries for each throughline in the story development process.

In essence, this passage offers guidance on constructing a well-rounded main character by selecting an appropriate throughline, which serves to not only define the character's essence but also to create a strong connection with the audience. It emphasizes careful selection and unique allocation of classes to throughlines to craft a rich and engaging narrative.
### Impact Character Throughline
#### Summary and Clarification

In this passage, the concept of an "Impact Character Throughline" in story crafting is discussed. It is vital to differentiate between the "Main Character" and the "Impact Character" for the effective portrayal of a story. Here's a breakdown and clarification of each part of your text:

#### **Understanding the Impact Character Throughline**

The Impact Character provides an external perspective on the situation or condition mirrored in the Main Character. While the audience empathizes and experiences the trials and tribulations of the Main Character, they perceive the Impact Character from an outside viewpoint, assessing their effect on other characters and events. The core focus is to analyze how the Impact Character "impacts" others, offering a contrasting perspective to the experiences of the Main Character.

#### **Various Throughlines of Impact Character**

1. **Situation (Universe)**: In this throughline, the Impact Character influences others due to their social status, race, gender, or other situational attributes. This presents an alternate paradigm, providing a different lens to view the situation compared to the Main Character.

2. **Activity (Physics)**: Here, the Impact Character engages in activities that encompass learning, understanding, doing, or obtaining. They serve to challenge the Main Character's stance, showcasing the repercussions of these activities more than the experiential aspect of engaging in them.

3. **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: This throughline represents an Impact Character with a strong fixation or attitude, mainly revolving around their memories, desires, or immediate responses. Their stance encourages the Main Character to rethink or justify their position in the story.

4. **Manipulation (Psychology)**: In this scenario, the Impact Character influences others either by direct manipulation or due to their unique thought process. This throughline focuses on illustrating how their thinking pattern affects those they interact with, providing an external view of the repercussions of their thought processes.

#### **Clarification**

Overall, this passage explores the nuanced role of the Impact Character in a story, highlighting their function to provide an external viewpoint and influence on the narrative, often serving as a counterpoint or alternative to the Main Character's experiences and perspectives. The selection of an appropriate throughline for the Impact Character can offer depth and complexity to the story, enhancing the narrative by presenting varied facets and impacts of the story's central issues or themes. The emphasis is on showcasing the "impact" these characters have on the storyline and other characters, offering a richer, multifaceted narrative experience.
### Subjective Story Throughline
#### Summary and Clarification

#### **Summary**

The Subjective Story Throughline serves as a domain where the emotional conflict and passionate argument between the Main and Impact Characters in a story unfold. It is integral in forming the emotional resonance of a story, focusing specifically on the dichotomy and relationship between these two central characters. This can be depicted through various Classes or perspectives - Situation (Universe), Activity (Physics), Fixed Attitude (Mind), and Manipulation (Psychology), each offering a distinct avenue of conflict and emotional discourse between the characters:

1. **Situation (Universe)**: The conflict is rooted in a specific situation or relationship that involves the characters, which could range from marital disagreements to business partnerships. The emphasis here is on the relational dynamics amidst specific circumstances.
   
2. **Activity (Physics)**: The characters find themselves at odds over a particular activity or set of actions, which might have different motivations or outcomes. This conflict forms the central emotional debate in the story.
   
3. **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: This encapsulates scenarios where the central conflict arises from conflicting ideologies or beliefs, ranging from prejudice to political views, that create a tension between the characters.
   
4. **Manipulation (Psychology)**: This perspective highlights conflicts arising from differing methods of thinking or problem-solving, where the process itself, rather than a specific attitude or situation, creates the rift between the characters.

#### **Clarification**

In essence, the passage breaks down the narrative concept of the "Subjective Story Throughline," explaining how it serves as a platform to showcase the emotional and argumentative dynamics between the Main and Impact Characters. Depending on the class chosen for the throughline, it can steer the story in different emotional directions, giving the audience varied perspectives on the conflict at hand. This tool allows authors to craft a richer narrative experience, creating nuanced, passionate arguments and discussions within the story that resonate emotionally with the audience. It essentially forms the backdrop where the emotional battles and conflicts between the main and impact characters are fought, lending a deeper layer of complexity and emotion to the narrative.
### Throughlines and Beyond
In this comprehensive excerpt from "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story," the nuances of creating a complex, rich narrative are explored through the lens of different story throughlines and concerns, further breaking down into classes, types, and variations that inform these throughlines and concerns. Here's a summary and clarification of each section discussed in the passage:

#### Subjective Story Throughline
**Summary:**
The Subjective Story Throughline focuses on the relationship and conflict between the Main and Impact Characters. The choice of class for this throughline significantly influences the emotional tone and engagement of the story. It can be depicted through different lenses: Situation (Universe), Activity (Physics), Fixed Attitude (Mind), and Manipulation (Psychology), each proposing a different kind of conflict and dynamics between the main and impact characters.

**Clarification:**
- **Situation (Universe):** This involves conflicts based on situations or conditions, like a marriage contract or business partnership, emphasizing time aspects like past, present, or future.
- **Activity (Physics):** Here, the conflict is based on an activity the characters are involved in, which might have various motivations.
- **Fixed Attitude (Mind):** This scenario portrays conflict centered around fixed mental states or attitudes.
- **Manipulation (Psychology):** This focuses on conflicts stemming from different ways of thinking or problem-solving approaches that are not appreciated by the characters involved.

### Concerns
**Summary:**
Concerns represent areas where problems are most prominent within each throughline - Overall Story, Main Character, Impact Character, and Subjective Story. These concerns highlight the different dimensions of the story's central problem from various perspectives, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. 

**Clarification:**
- **Overall Story Concern:** A shared concern amongst all characters, possibly focused on a common goal or varied personal objectives. 
- **Main Character Concern:** Specific to the Main Character, detailing their primary worries or interests regarding the central problem.
- **Impact Character Concern:** Reflects the area where the Impact Character has the most significant influence or effect.
- **Subjective Story Concern:** Focuses on the primary area of conflict or disagreement between the Main and Impact Characters.

### Variations on a Theme
**Summary:**
This part explains how the story's problem is refined further through "Issues" that explore the themes within each throughline. These issues help in establishing thematic conflicts and providing depth to the character's perspectives and the story's thematic narrative.

**Clarification:**
- **Overall Story Issue:** It reflects the universal values and judgments prevalent in the story, often manifested in thematic conflicts like Morality vs. Self-Interest.
- **Main Character Issue:** A personal thematic conflict pertinent to the Main Character, adding depth to their perspective.
- **Impact Character Issue:** Helps evaluate the Impact Character's influence, giving the author a tool to depict their bias subtly.
- **Subjective Story Issue:** Highlights why the Main and Impact Characters have conflicts over the shared concern, bringing out the different evaluation standards used by them.

#### It's Elemental!
**Summary:**
This section indicates that the elemental level is where the core problems in each throughline are found, fundamentally driving the actions and conflicts in the narrative.

**Clarification:**
At the elemental level, each throughline has a central problem that drives the characters and their actions. These problems can relate to individual drives or the relationship between characters, helping in establishing the author's stance on the central issues of the story.

In a nutshell, this theory emphasizes a structured and multidimensional approach to crafting a story, ensuring a rich, comprehensive narrative that encompasses various perspectives and thematic layers.

### Deep Theme

This text introduces the concept of "Thematic Argument" in the Dramatica theory of story development. The theory delves deeply into the thematic elements of storytelling and discusses how to build a persuasive and compelling narrative. Here is a summarized and clarified breakdown of the main points discussed in the passage:

#### Deep Theme and Thematic Argument

- **Concepts introduced**: Deep Theme and Thematic Argument
- **Explanation**: The text emphasizes that simply defining elements of a theme is insufficient; they must also be brought to life or put into motion via a thematic argument. This argument is essential to engage audiences and persuade them regarding the author's standpoint on the story's central issues. The argument should appeal to audiences on an emotional level and provide valuable insights into real-life situations.
  
#### Premise and Thematic Argument

- **Concepts introduced**: Premise and Thematic Argument
- **Explanation**: It suggests that a thematic argument often starts with a premise, a concise statement that illustrates the central argument of a story (e.g., "Greed leads to self-destruction"). However, it argues that traditional premises are limited as they only offer a singular viewpoint, lacking depth and nuance. Moreover, these premises do not facilitate the author in crafting a well-rounded thematic argument.
- **Dramatica's approach**: Introduces a thematic conflict where each narrative thread (throughline) presents a different viewpoint on the thematic conflict, offering a more detailed and nuanced exploration of the theme.

#### Dramatica's Thematic Argument

- **Concepts introduced**: Thematic conflict, Issue, Counterpoint
- **Explanation**: The thematic argument in Dramatica is constructed through thematic conflicts which are represented by an Issue and a counterpoint, which opposes it dynamically. It emphasizes the necessity of portraying both sides of the argument to persuade the audience effectively. Moreover, it allows the author to present nuanced perspectives on each side rather than a binary good vs. bad depiction.
- **Outcome and Judgment**: Explains that the thematic argument concludes with two aspects: the outcome (success or failure) and the judgment (good or bad), offering four broad conclusions: happy ending, tragedy, personal tragedy, and personal triumph. These conclusions depend on the resolution of the thematic conflicts and the audience's emotional journey through the story.

#### Sewing Together the Themes

- **Concepts introduced**: Thematic conflict development, story points and their relationships
- **Explanation**: Highlights the limitations of traditional premises and promotes Dramatica's approach to thematic arguments, which encompasses thematic conflict, valuation of standards, and an assessment of satisfaction and fulfillment. It further discusses the complexity of relationships between different story points and the necessity of a computer to maintain consistency.

#### Additional Story Points

- **Concepts introduced**: Throughline, Concern, Issue, Problem, Solution, Focus, Direction, Unique Ability, Critical Flaw, Catalyst, Inhibitor, Benchmark
- **Explanation**: Expands on additional story points in the Dramatica theory, such as Problem, Solution, Focus, and Direction in various throughlines, along with Unique Abilities and Critical Flaws in Main and Impact Character Throughlines. It explains the influence of Catalysts and Inhibitors on the pacing of the story and introduces Benchmarks as a method of charting the growth of each throughline. 

Overall, the passage outlines a detailed approach to constructing thematic arguments in storytelling, offering authors a nuanced and comprehensive tool to craft compelling narratives. It emphasizes the role of conflict and a balanced portrayal of different aspects of the thematic conflict in engaging the audience and creating a persuasive narrative.
## The Elements of Structure: Plot
The passage details a section from the book "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story", where the intricacies of story structure are dissected, particularly focusing on the concept of 'plot' and 'storyweaving'. It's important to differentiate between the plot (the actual sequence of events within a story) and the way these events are presented or revealed to the audience - a concept referred to as 'storyweaving'.

To illustrate this difference, examples from various novels and movies are cited. In essence, the plot structure maintains an internal logic from the perspective of the characters involved, while the order in which this is conveyed to the audience can vary. The sequence can either follow a chronological order or be rearranged to create a different impact on the audience, without altering the underlying logic or message of the plot.

The passage then transitions into the thematic aspects of a plot, introducing 'plot story points' which are elements that form the core of the storyline, impacting all characters and connecting different storylines together. These elements include goal, requirements, consequences, forewarnings, dividends, costs, prerequisites, and preconditions.

1. **Goal** - The central objective that binds all characters, derived from their individual concerns.
2. **Requirements** - Essential steps or conditions that must be met to achieve the goal.
3. **Consequences** - What happens if the goal is not achieved, often manifested as troubles or challenges that the characters have to face.
4. **Forewarnings** - Indicators of how close the characters are to facing the consequences, raising the tension in the storyline.
5. **Dividends** - Benefits or rewards that characters receive during their journey towards the goal, serving to motivate them to continue.
6. **Costs** - Negative repercussions or sacrifices that characters have to endure while striving towards the goal, adding layers of complexity to the story.
7. **Prerequisites** - Essential elements or conditions that need to be secured before the characters can pursue the goal.
8. **Preconditions** - Additional, non-essential conditions imposed on the characters, usually by external forces, adding a further layer of complexity to the plot.

It also highlights that these elements can vary in their degree of influence on the plot, categorized as either 'Driver' story points (Goal, Requirements, Consequences, Forewarnings) which direct the core path of the story, or 'Passenger' story points (Dividends, Costs, Prerequisites, Preconditions) which modulate or influence the course set by the drivers, providing depth and nuance to the narrative.

Furthermore, the passage illustrates how these plot story points can be embedded within different cultural narratives and how they interact with character dynamics, shaping the overall narrative structure. It explains that these elements remain consistent, even when viewed from different perspectives or through different thematic lenses.

Overall, the excerpt provides an in-depth analysis of plot structure and thematic elements, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding and crafting compelling narratives.

### Plot Progression
This text discusses the intricacies of constructing a detailed narrative, breaking down the plot structure into a series of points and throughlines, all of which are essential to weaving a comprehensive story.

Here's a summarized clarification of the text:

In crafting a story, different components and perspectives work together to build the narrative's plot progression. These elements are categorized into several story points:

1. **Overall Story Throughline Points**: General story points that describe the central narrative arc.
2. **Main Character Story Points**: Points focusing on the main character's journey and evolution.
3. **Impact Character Story Points**: Points that highlight the role and influence of the impact character in the story.
4. **Subjective Story Throughline Points**: These emphasize the relationship and interactions between the main and impact characters.

Apart from the above, there are central story points like "Goal," "Requirements," and "Consequences" that synthesize the perspectives of all four throughlines, significantly influencing the plot progression.

These story points exhibit a consistent nature throughout the story, referred to as **Static Story Points**. They represent a theme or a commentary on the entire narrative, maintaining their characteristics from the beginning to the end of the story. They shape the plot and influence the characters' concerns and issues.

Conversely, **Progressive Story Points** depict how the story evolves over time. They represent a different appreciation level in the story, moving from one issue to another as the narrative develops. These points are structured as Acts, Sequences, Scenes, and Events, working similarly to how we measure time (Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds). They nest within each other, each bearing the flavor of the larger unit it resides in and influencing the smaller units it encompasses. These progressive points explain how the story unfolds, whereas static points describe what the story is about.

An analogy used in the text compares the intertwining throughlines to a football game watched by four referees, each offering a unique perspective on the events happening on the field, thus influencing the unfolding of the game. Similarly, in a story, each throughline provides a different angle on the events, influencing and being influenced by the other throughlines in a consistent manner. 

In conclusion, understanding the narrative's static and progressive story points allows one to appreciate the story's depth, with the actual plot emerging as a synthesis of all four throughline plots, which is realized in the audience's mind as the story progresses. The ultimate goal is to create a well-rounded narrative that intricately combines these elements to convey the story's true meaning.
### *Acts*
This passage elucidates a concept in the "Dramatica" theory of story structure concerning the progression of acts within a narrative. Here's a breakdown:

#### Thematic Structure and Throughline Concerns:
- **Classes** in the thematic structure have four types each, which dwell a level below the class.
- In the **Activity (Physics) Class**, these types are Learning, Understanding, Doing, and Obtaining.
- One of these types will be a **throughline's Concern** - a central focus that remains constant throughout the story.
- For instance, if "Obtaining" is the concern of the **Overall Story Throughline**, characters in the story will persistently be engrossed with "obtaining" something from the beginning till the end.
- However, the characters actively engage in a series of efforts in order to realize this concern, which is divided into stages represented by the types: Learning, Understanding, Doing, and Obtaining.

#### The Significance of Sequence:
- The sequence in which these stages or types are explored can vary, which, in turn, alters the meaning created by the narrative.
- Analogically, the order of two events (a slap and a scream, as given in the text) can change their progressive meaning although their static meaning remains unchanged.
- This principle applies to the development of acts in a story, where the order of exploring the types modifies the progressive interpretation of the plot in that throughline.

#### 3-Act Progression versus 4-Act Structure:
- Despite Aristotle's ancient theory advocating for a three-act structure in storytelling (beginning, middle, and end), the Dramatica theory proposes a four-act structure.
- This four-act structure can be visualized as a journey between four cities (A, B, C, D), with three separate journeys connecting them.
- Each of these cities represents a **signpost**, a stage in the plot, and the journeys represent transitions between these stages.
- Therefore, in a four-act structure, there are four signposts and three journeys, amounting to seven progressive story points in a throughline, offering a more nuanced view of the narrative progression compared to the traditional three-act structure.
- Essentially, this perspective makes it easier to understand and construct a plot, avoiding the ambiguity that often comes with determining the events in the middle section (Act 2) of a three-act structure.

#### Summary:
The passage explores the intricate nature of story building, emphasizing the significance of thematic classes and types in constructing a plot. It introduces a nuanced four-act structure, contrasting it with Aristotle's three-act plot progression theory, demonstrating how the modern four-act structure can provide a more detailed and clear roadmap for narrative development, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding and construction of a story's plot.

### *Sequences*
This passage from "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" discusses the concept of "Sequences", which are a critical part of the progressive story points in narrative structure according to the Dramatica theory.

#### Clarification and Detailed Summary:

##### About Sequences:

- **Sequences**, like acts, are a form of progressive story points, but are more closely aligned with the theme of the story rather than the plot. They fall under the variation level of the structure.
- Sequences work with a quad of variations, just as acts work with a quad of types.
![[Pasted image 20230909212420.png]]
##### Analyzing Sequences through an Example:

- The text illustrates an example where the story has an **Overall Story Throughline** in the **Activity (Physics) Class**, and the main concern is "Obtaining", and the central issue is "Morality".
- In the context of this story, the **Morality Quad** consists of the following elements: **Approach, Morality, Attitude,** and **Self-Interest**. 
- Morality and Self-Interest form a counter-point pair, and the theme of the story comes from the balance between various pairs that can be created from the quad elements.
  
##### Exploring Various Pairs within the Morality Quad:

- Six pairs can be made from the elements in the quad, each offering a different angle to explore the relative value of Morality to Self-Interest. These pairs are:
  1. Morality/Self-Interest
  2. Morality/Attitude
  3. Morality/Approach
  4. Self-Interest/Attitude
  5. Self-Interest/Approach
  6. Attitude/Approach
- Analyzing these pairs through different thematic sequences can thoroughly explore the argument regarding the absolute value of Morality in comparison to Self-Interest.
![[Pasted image 20230909212430.png]]
##### Questions to Explore Each Pair:

The passage suggests exploring each pair by asking specific questions, such as assessing the better of the two between Morality and Self-Interest, evaluating the attitude and approach of those who uphold Morality or Self-Interest, and deciding which should have more weight between Attitude and Approach concerning the issue at hand.

#### Simplified Summary:

The passage describes the role of sequences in developing the theme of a story as per the Dramatica theory. Sequences exist at the variation level of the narrative structure and engage with a group of closely related aspects, known as a quad, to scrutinize and establish the theme further. Through the analysis of various possible pairs within a quad, like the Morality quad in the given example, the thematic argument of a story can be fully developed and presented, adding depth to the narrative by examining different perspectives and relative values connected to the central issue.
### *How Sequences Relate to Acts*

#### Summary and Clarification:

The passage discusses the role of sequences, acts, and scenes in shaping a story according to the Dramatica theory of story development. 

##### Sequences and Acts:

**Sequences** relate to acts in a specific way. They form the thematic backbone of the story, with different sequences exploring various thematic questions, usually centered around the story's central issue. They are divided into three or four-act structures, with the thematic sequences occurring in pairs within three dynamic acts. This division forms the plot and theme progression that gives an act break its distinctive feel. The ordering of these sequences can influence the audience's thematic experience but not the overall message of the story.

##### Four Act Progressions:

Meanwhile, in a **four-act progression**, the acts serve as a roadmap of the story’s terrain. Each act explores a particular “Type”, and the theme associated with that type is examined through four variations that lie beneath it. This process allows for a thematic statement to be made about the central subject of concern in each of the structural acts. 

##### Scene Resolutions and Elements:

**Scenes**, on the other hand, are the minutiae in the storytelling, where the dynamics between various elements are captured and exhibited, mainly focusing on character relationships. These elements are building blocks of characters encompassing motivations, methodologies, means of evaluation, and purposes. The scene thus is a temporal container holding dynamics within its bounds and also highlighting the shifts in dynamics between the elements over time.

##### Interrelationship between Theme, Scenes, and Acts:

The total number of scenes generated at the elemental level is 24, evenly distributed across acts, contributing to the distinct feel at each act break. These 24 scenes are partitioned in such a way to accommodate both three and four-act structures comfortably, thereby ensuring a seamless progression of the story. Sequences, a crucial aspect in this setup, play a vital role in defining thematic movements, which have a potent subjective appreciation but diminish in a more objective four-act view.

#### Simplified Summary:

The passage explains the intricate interplay between sequences, acts, and scenes in crafting a story as per Dramatica theory. Sequences, forming the thematic crux, work harmoniously within a three or four-act structure, exploring and addressing various thematic queries central to the story's issue. Scenes encapsulate the dynamic relationships between characters, driven by underlying elements that constitute the characters. This comprehensive approach to storytelling ensures a rich, layered narrative where thematic sequences, plot developments, and character dynamics are finely intertwined, offering a robust and engaging narrative experience to the audience.

### Themes & Events
### Summary and Clarification:

This excerpt discusses the intricate nature of story crafting, highlighting the nuances of scenes, sequences, and events in the context of the Dramatica theory of story.

#### Scene Resolution and Dynamics:

When it comes to **scene resolution**, the concept speaks to the need for minimizing focus to truly understand the dynamic workings within the scene, amidst the potential clutter of multiple narrative layers. Scenes are essentially temporal containers that encapsulate dynamics, characterized by changing relationships between characters, and these dynamics are built upon elements representing motivations, methodologies, evaluation methods, and purposes. 

#### Relation Between Scenes and Acts:

The text then describes the arithmetic of how scenes fit into acts. It states that **24 scenes** are constructed at the elemental level, which break down evenly into both three and four-act structures. This division contributes to the feeling that each act break signifies a significant turning point in the story. Sequences, which partition the story into six parts, fit evenly into a three-act structure but not into a four-act one, illustrating the difference between subjective appreciation and objective analysis in storytelling.

#### Event Resolution and Throughlines:

In the section on **events**, it is illustrated that the Dramatica model is recursive, circling back at the end to reconsider the beginning, thus creating a loop. The smallest dynamic units in the model blend into the largest structural units. Events are depicted by broader stroke structural units called Classes, which encompass Situation (Universe), Fixed Attitude (Mind), Activity (Physics), and Manipulation (Psychology). Each scene needs to describe all four classes to be considered complete, portraying a situation, an activity, a manner of thinking, and a state of mind. 

#### Misrepresentation of Events as Scenes:

However, sometimes what might seem like scenes are actually events. In a well-structured story, a total of **96 events** occur, divided across 24 scenes. The illusion of more scenes often occurs due to changing locations within events, which might lead one to perceive separate scenes. However, a well-designed story will show that all four classes are represented, emphasizing certain aspects of the narrative over others.

### Simplified Summary:

The passage elaborates on the Dramatica theory of story crafting, focusing on the dynamics of scenes and events. It illustrates that scenes are temporal containers encapsulating various dynamics and changing relationships between characters built on foundational elements. The structure of a story is carefully divided into 24 scenes that seamlessly fit into three or four-act structures, with sequences playing a significant role in the thematic movements of the story.

Furthermore, the story model is recursive, with events representing the broader structural units of Classes. These events, forming the intricate fabric of the story, often mislead as separate scenes due to changes in location or emphasis within the narrative, contributing to a complex yet rich storytelling process.
## The Elements of Structure: Genre
**Summary and Clarification:**

The given text presents a deep dive into the understanding of story structure, focusing heavily on how different components (Characters, Themes, Plots, and Genre) are built upon specific structural levels. 

**Core Points:**

1. **Character, Theme, Plot, and Genre Structure:**
   - The *Character* structure is based on the *Element* level.
   - The *Theme* primarily comes from the *Variation* level.
   - The *Plot* is derived from the *Types*.
   - The *Genre* is most influenced by the *Class* level.

2. **Throughlines & Genre:**
   - Assigning a perspective to a Class results in a story's Throughlines. These Throughlines have the largest structural influence on Genre.

3. **Storytelling and Structural Components:**
   - As one moves from Character to Plot, structural components (Elements, Variations, Types) decrease in significance compared to storytelling.
   - Character is defined by its dramatic functions, Theme by dramatic variations, and Plot by its acts.
   - Genre is the least structural aspect and is more influenced by storytelling.

4. **Understanding Genre:**
   - Genres can refer to settings (e.g., Westerns, Science Fiction), character relationships (e.g., Love Stories), audience feelings (e.g., Horror, Comedy), or even storytelling styles (e.g., Musicals).
   - Traditional Genre classifications (like those in video stores) are limiting and only really help categorize finished works. They don't assist writers in the creation process.
  
5. **Dramatica's Approach to Genre:**
   - Dramatica aids writers in building a story's underlying structure. 
   - Encoding is like placing muscle on the skeleton, weaving is like clothing the creation, and reception is how the audience reacts.
   - When seen from a writer's viewpoint, the foundation for Genre is structural. It begins by understanding four Classes:
     - **Situation (Universe):** External state; a situation.
     - **Activity (Physics):** External process; an activity.
     - **Fixed Attitude (Mind):** Internal state; an attitude or bias.
     - **Manipulation (Psychology):** Internal process; a thinking manner or manipulation.

6. **Modes of Expression:**
   - Dramatica introduces four modes of expression that help convey the story's structure to the audience:
     - **Information:** Emphasizes knowledge.
     - **Drama:** Emphasizes thought.
     - **Comedy:** Emphasizes ability.
     - **Entertainment:** Emphasizes desire.

7. **Combining Classes with Modes:**
   - By matching the Dramatica Classes with the modes of expression, authors can control the story's feel.
   - This is like how Throughlines are formed by connecting a point of view to a Class.
   - Genres create external perspectives, while Throughlines are internal to the story and depict how perspectives shift.

In essence, the text elaborates on the intricacies of story structure, focusing on how different components interact and influence one another, with special emphasis on the role and understanding of Genre. Dramatica offers a fresh perspective on understanding and categorizing Genre to assist writers more effectively.
### Grid of Dramatica Genres 
In the text, the concept of genre within the framework of "Dramatica," a theory of storytelling, is discussed in great depth. Here's a summary and clarification of the core ideas presented in the text:

#### Summary:

The "Dramatica" theory proposes a structured approach to storytelling, examining it through various levels: Elements, Variations, Types, and Classes, each progressively influencing the story less structurally and more in terms of storytelling nuances. The theory explores how genre, a component significantly influenced at the Class level, can be defined and utilized more effectively by writers to craft deeper, more engaging stories. It introduces a grid that combines four Classes (Situation, Activity, Fixed Attitude, Manipulation) with four modes of expression (Information, Drama, Comedy, Entertainment) to help authors predict the impact and feel of their stories on audiences. Additionally, it highlights the importance of aligning these combinations with four Dramatica Throughlines to position the audience’s perspective and engagement with the story appropriately.

#### Clarification:

1. **Classes and Modes of Expression**: 
   - **Classes**: Represent the subject matter that will be covered in a story's genre. They are broken down into:
     - **Situation (Universe)**: External states or conditions.
     - **Activity (Physics)**: External processes or actions.
     - **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: Internal states, attitudes, or biases.
     - **Manipulation (Psychology)**: Internal processes, thinking, or manipulations.
   
   - **Modes of Expression**: Represent the ways a story’s structure can be conveyed to the audience, comprising:
     - **Information**: Focuses on knowledge or education.
     - **Drama**: Engages the audience in serious thought or exploration.
     - **Comedy**: Evokes humor, highlighting abilities or mishaps.
     - **Entertainment**: Focuses on catering to the audience's desires, providing diversion through various means.

2. **Grid of Dramatica Genres**: A tool that helps authors determine the impact and feel of their story on the audience by combining Classes and modes of expression. This grid suggests various types of genres based on the combination of classes and modes, for instance:
   - Informational Documentaries (Information/Situation)
   - Action Dramas (Drama/Activity)
   - Situational Comedies (Comedy/Situation)
   - Entertainment through Thrills (Entertainment/Activity), etc.

3. **Throughlines**: These are used to position the audience in relation to the subject matter, providing different perspectives and engagement levels. The four Throughlines are:
   - **Main Character Throughline**: Offers a personal, first-person view of the story.
   - **Impact Character Throughline**: Gives an impersonal, second-person view focusing on the impact of events or characters.
   - **Subjective Story Throughline**: Provides a passionate view of relationships in the story, using a first-person plural perspective.
   - **Overall Story Throughline**: Offers a broader, third-person perspective on the story, presenting the "big picture."

By combining these concepts strategically, writers can craft stories with well-defined genres that offer deeper engagement and a balanced structure, enhancing the art of storytelling.

|               | Situation (Universe) | Activity (Physics) | Fixed Attitude (Mind) | Manipulation (Psychology) |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Information (Education)    | Where/What it is     | How it works       | What it means         | Why it's important        |
| Drama (Serious)        | Exploration Drama    | Action Drama       | Bias Drama            | Growth Drama              |

| Entertainment (Diversion)  | Entertainment through Atmosphere | Entertainment through Thrills | Entertainment through Concept | Entertainment through Twists |

#### Information (Education)

1. **Where/What it is (Situation/Universe)**: This category explores events and situations, emphasizing the evolution and the current state of affairs. Genres in this category often include documentaries and historical pieces.
   
2. **How it Works (Activity/Physics)**: Here, the focus is on examining and explaining specific processes or activities, often seen in educational, informational, or instructional content.

3. **What it Means (Fixed Attitude/Mind)**: This explores various opinions and viewpoints, emphasizing the context they are made in. It often includes inspirational and motivational content.

4. **Why it's Important (Manipulation/Psychology)**: This category involves examining value systems, focusing on providing context that is personally relevant to the audience, often seen in persuasive or propagandist content.

#### Drama (Serious)

1. **Exploration Drama (Situation/Universe)**: This involves serious scrutiny of an unbalanced "state of things", often seen in courtroom, crime, or classroom dramas.
   
2. **Action Drama (Activity/Physics)**: Focuses on the problems arising from ongoing activities, often encompassing genres like espionage and war dramas.

3. **Bias Drama (Fixed Attitude/Mind)**: Takes a serious look at conflicts that arise from conflicting attitudes, found in genres focusing on obsession and prejudice.

4. **Growth Drama (Manipulation/Psychology)**: Examines the efforts to overcome difficulties stemming from manipulations or evolving identities, as seen in coming-of-age and dysfunctional family dramas.

#### Comedy (Humor)

1. **Situation Comedy (Situation/Universe)**: Emphasizes humor arising from characters placed in various predicaments, commonly found in TV sitcoms.

2. **Physical Comedy (Activity/Physics)**: Encompasses humor derived from physical activities, typically seen in slapstick comedies and works of Charlie Chaplin.

3. **Comedy of Manners (Fixed Attitude/Mind)**: Focuses on humor arising from conflicting attitudes and biases, often seen in drawing-room comedies like works by Oscar Wilde.

4. **Comedy of Errors (Manipulation/Psychology)**: Encompasses humor derived from misinterpretations or attribution errors, as seen in several Shakespearean comedies.

#### Entertainment (Diversion)

1. **Entertainment through Atmosphere (Situation/Universe)**: Involves entertainment arising from unique or interesting settings, including genres like fantasy, horror, and science fiction.

2. **Entertainment through Thrills (Activity/Physics)**: Focuses on providing entertainment through unique or exhilarating experiences, typically found in action adventures or suspense genres.

3. **Entertaining Concept (Fixed Attitude/Mind)**: Encompasses entertainment stemming from novel ideas, often seen in high-concept pieces.

4. **Entertainment through Twists (Manipulation/Psychology)**: Focuses on entertainment derived from intriguing forms of audience manipulation, commonly found in mystery and thriller genres.

This structure helps in understanding the potential impact of different genres and themes on audiences, providing a comprehensive tool for authors and storytellers to craft narratives with specific desired impacts.


### EXAMPLE 1:
The excerpt is discussing the complexities of the Dramatica theory of storytelling which categorizes narratives based on four different criteria: universe/situation, activity/physics, mindset/fixed attitude, and manipulation/psychology. It highlights how these categories can be molded to create different narrative genres: information (documentary, educational, inspirational), drama (courtroom, crime, obsession dramas), comedy (sitcoms, slapstick, comedy of manners), and entertainment (fantasy, action adventure, thrillers).

Here's a more detailed explanation and summary of each part of the excerpt:

### Part 1:
This part of the excerpt outlines various genres and modes of storytelling, dividing them into four main categories based on the focus and method of storytelling:

1. Information:
   - Universe: Historical documentaries or period pieces analyzing events or situations.
   - Physics: Educational or instructional content explaining processes.
   - Mind: Inspirational content exploring opinions and points of view.
   - Psychology: Propaganda or persuasion, examining value systems.
   
2. Drama:
   - Universe: Dramas exploring imbalances in the "state of things."
   - Physics: Dramas focusing on issues arising from ongoing activities.
   - Mind: Dramas concentrating on conflicts stemming from incompatible attitudes.
   - Psychology: Dramas revolving around manipulative attempts to overcome difficulties.

3. Comedy:
   - Universe: Comedies deriving humor from situational predicaments.
   - Physics: Physical comedies utilizing slapstick or pratfalls.
   - Mind: Comedies of manners, highlighting divergent attitudes or biases.
   - Psychology: Comedy of errors, utilizing misinterpretation or attribution errors for humor.

4. Entertainment:
   - Universe: Genres using unique or interesting settings to entertain.
   - Physics: Genres providing thrills through new or unique activities.
   - Mind: Genres presenting new or interesting ideas for entertainment.
   - Psychology: Genres using audience manipulation techniques for entertainment.

### Part 2:
In this section, the theory suggests that a well-rounded story can contain a blend of different genres and throughlines, providing a more engaging and emotionally diverse experience for the audience. A balanced narrative would incorporate elements of information, drama, comedy, and entertainment, potentially using different throughlines for the overall story, main character, impact character, and subjective story relationship. The narrative can be more dynamic and immersive by carefully selecting throughlines based on intuition and feelings.

### Part 3:
This section introduces the concept of "Progressive Appreciation of Genre", explaining that a throughline in a story can dynamically change and adopt different modes of expression as the story unfolds. However, these shifts should adhere to a natural progression to maintain consistency and emotional coherence. It warns against abrupt shifts in genre modes as it can disrupt the narrative flow, using the film "Hudson Hawke" as a negative example.

### Part 4:
This part further expands on the "Progressive Appreciation of Genre", illustrating that the modes of expression in a story can cycle seamlessly, creating a varied and unique narrative genre by the end of the story. It proposes a visualization where the table of class/modes of expression forms a cylinder, allowing for a smooth transition between different modes, and offering a rich and complex narrative structure.

Overall, the Dramatica theory presents a multifaceted approach to narrative structure, encouraging variety and depth in storytelling through the skillful manipulation of genres and throughlines. It offers a framework for writers to craft narratives with a nuanced and desired impact on the audience.
# Section 2: The Art of Storytelling
In this excerpt, the author explores the intricacies of storytelling from the perspective of the "Dramatica" theory. Here's a concise summary and clarification of the key points presented:

### **Summary:**

The excerpt delves deep into the theory of storytelling as detailed in the "Dramatica" method, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between a story's structure (comprising elements like character, theme, plot, and genre) and its presentation. The narrative journey is delineated into four significant stages: Storyforming, Storyencoding, Storyweaving, and Reception. Each stage plays a vital role in the development and communication of a story, allowing for a thorough process where both the author and the audience actively participate in crafting and interpreting the narrative. 

### **Clarification:**

1. **Storyforming**: This initial stage focuses on establishing the primary structure of the story, defining the core elements like the theme, plot, genre, and characters. Here, the intrinsic meaning that the author intends to communicate is conceived.

2. **Storyencoding**: In this stage, the author selects appropriate symbols and narrative devices to represent the core elements established in the storyforming stage. It is crucial because it helps in translating the abstract concepts into tangible and interpretable entities.

3. **Storyweaving**: This is the phase where the encoded elements are intricately interwoven to create a cohesive narrative. The author decides on the order and the emphasis of the various components, which significantly influence the audience's experience and perception of the story. This stage provides flexibility to the author in terms of narrative style and presentation, such as beginning the story at different points in the narrative timeline.

4. **Reception**: This final stage centers on the audience's role in interpreting and understanding the story. The audience decodes the symbols and constructs meaning from the presented narrative, which might sometimes diverge from the author's original intent based on their individual perspectives and preconceptions.

Furthermore, the text emphasizes the necessity for the author to adopt both creator and audience perspectives, allowing for a holistic approach to storytelling that ensures narrative coherence and effectiveness. It also suggests that using the Dramatica model, which provides a structured view of story dynamics, can help authors maintain a balanced approach to storytelling, ensuring that the emphasis on different narrative aspects aligns with their intentions. However, it cautions against over-reliance on the audience perspective, which might obscure specific details necessary for a well-rounded story.

This section of the text prepares readers to transition from understanding the structural elements of storytelling to exploring the nuances of the art of storytelling, indicating a shift towards more detailed insights into the communication processes involved in narrating a story.

## Stage 1: Storyforming

### Introduction to Storyforming
This text is an excerpt from "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story" discussing the stages and considerations an author undergoes in the process of developing a story. Here’s a summarized and clarified version of the text:

### **Journey of Story Creation**

#### **Finding Inspiration**
In the initial stage of crafting a story, an author might not have a clear picture of the entire narrative. The inspiration to start writing might come from various small elements like an action scene, dialogue, or even just a title. This inspiration might be derived from a personal emotion, experience, or a particular perspective on a subject. The creative process tends to evolve, where one idea leads to another, gradually expanding the initial concept into a complex tapestry of interconnected elements.

#### **Shaping the Structure**
As the narrative expands, the author transitions from being a creator to an analyst, scrutinizing the emerging story to develop a comprehensive structure. They need to visualize the broader picture considering four critical aspects: character, theme, plot, and genre. They have to refine character perspectives, fill logical gaps, and foster a cohesive theme throughout the narrative. Although elements of a story are present, the author needs to meticulously refine these fragments to form a complete, well-rounded story.

#### **Refinement Process**
During the refinement process, the author identifies inconsistencies and gaps that need to be addressed to develop a unified story. This includes removing out-of-place items and filling evident gaps to create a narrative that flows seamlessly. The goal is to craft a story that transcends its individual parts, embodying a unique identity.

#### **Communication and Storytelling**
The finished story comprises two primary components: the underlying structure, referred to as the "Storyform," and the expressive component, termed "Storytelling." While the storyform is the foundational structure determining the narrative's logistics, storytelling is the creative expression that brings life to this structure. This phase highlights the distinction between the core narrative (Storyform) and its representation (Storytelling), showcasing how the same foundational structure can be presented in varying manners, akin to different tenants occupying and personalizing the same apartment space over time.

#### **Navigating Challenges**
An essential insight shared is the intertwined nature of storyform and storytelling, which can sometimes complicate the refinement process. Authors might struggle to pinpoint the exact areas needing adjustment, hindered by their personal biases and assumptions. To alleviate this, the author can consider starting with establishing a solid storyform, outlining the essential emotional and logical aspects to ensure a cohesive and consistent foundation, before diving into the storytelling aspect. This approach necessitates a thoughtful consideration of the topics to be explored and the intended impact on the audience, potentially preventing challenges that might arise later in the development process.

This summary maintains the flow and critical insights presented in the original excerpt, providing a clearer and more concise overview of the narrative creation process according to "Dramatica, A New Theory of Story." It delineates the stages of story creation, from inception and structuring to refinement and storytelling, emphasizing the challenges and strategies authors might employ to develop a cohesive narrative.

### Audience Impact
#### Summary

The excerpt discusses key elements for shaping a story, focusing specifically on crafting the main character's dynamics and their impact on the overall narrative. Here's a condensed overview of the discussed concepts:

#### 1. Audience Impact
* Essential questions that focus on the main character and the plot to shape a compelling story.
* The interaction of structural and dynamic relationships in character development.

#### 2. Main Character Dynamics
* **Resolve (Change or Steadfast)**: Determines if the main character changes or remains the same by the end, affecting the story's central argument and the audience's perception of the character's success or failure.
* **Growth (Stop or Start)**: Dictates the direction of the main character's personal development, either evolving by adding or shedding a characteristic, or demonstrating growth in their environment.
* **Approach (Do-er or Be-er)**: Establishes the main character's preferred method of addressing problems, either through physical actions or mental deliberations.
* **Mental Sex (Male or Female)**: Describes the character's problem-solving technique, either linear (male) or holistic (female), independent of the character's physical gender.

#### Clarification

To provide a clearer understanding of the concepts presented:

#### 1. **Audience Impact**
The core of the story is framed by answering eight critical questions that focus on the main character and the overarching plot. Understanding these can transform a basic idea into a well-rounded story. These questions help in determining both the plot progression and the evolution of the character dynamics over the course of the story.

#### 2. **Main Character Dynamics**
* **Resolve (Change or Steadfast)**: This dynamic focuses on whether the main character undergoes a significant transformation by the end of the story or remains steadfast. This aspect plays a critical role in conveying the story's central argument, influencing the audience's perspective on the character's journey.
  
* **Growth (Stop or Start)**: Here, the emphasis is on the direction of the main character's growth. Regardless of whether the character changes fundamentally, they experience growth either by developing new abilities or understanding or adapting to their environment.

* **Approach (Do-er or Be-er)**: This aspect delineates the main character's preferred method of problem-solving, which can be through direct actions (Do-er) or through intellectual and emotional means (Be-er). The choice between the two shapes how the character interacts with their environment and addresses the challenges they face.

* **Mental Sex (Male or Female)**: This concept describes the character's innate problem-solving technique, whether linear (male) or holistic (female), which governs how they approach challenges. It's essential to note that this is unrelated to the character's gender or sexual preferences, and rather focuses on their cognitive approach to resolving issues.

| Female Attribute                     | Male Attribute                                      |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Looks at motivations                 | Looks at purposes                                   |
| Tries to see connections             | Tries to gather evidence                            |
| Sets up conditions                   | Sets up requirements                                |
| Determines the leverage points       | Breaks a job into steps that can restore balance    |
| Seeks fulfillment                    | Seeks satisfaction                                  |
| Concentrates on "Why"                | Concentrates on "How", "When", and "What"           |
| Puts the issues in context           | Argues the issues                                   |
| Tries to hold it all together        | Tries to pull it all together                       |


The theory posits that understanding and effectively utilizing these dynamics in story crafting can provide a solid structure, offering guidelines to authors for creating nuanced, compelling narratives. It allows for rich character development, creating a complex narrative that engages the audience deeply.

### Plot Dynamics
In the provided text, there's an exploration of various dynamics that shape a story and its characters. Here's a summarized and clarified version of the three sections:

### Section 1: Plot Dynamics - Overall Story Driver: Action or Decision?

**Summary**: 
The story progresses through a series of actions and decisions, with one taking precedence over the other. The "inciting event" that sparks the story's central problem will align with the primary driver—either action or decision—that also resolves it. The chosen background influences how the main character approaches the issue, potentially leading to compelling dramatic scenarios.

**Clarification**:
- **Overall Story Driver**: Indicates whether actions provoke decisions or vice versa, setting a pattern from the story's beginning to its conclusion.
- **Action or Decision Preference**: Dictates the main background against which the main character operates, and can create interesting dynamics if the character's nature contrasts with the story background.
- **Main Character Types**:
  - **Do-er**: A character more inclined to take action, may struggle with deliberative problems.
  - **Be-er**: A character more prone to contemplation, might find issues requiring immediate action challenging.

---

### Section 2: Overall Story Limit: Timelock or Optionlock?

**Summary**: 
The story's tension and ultimate conclusion are determined by either a timelock (a time constraint) or an optionlock (limited choices). These limits dictate how the main character approaches the resolution and influence the audience's perception of the growing tension.

**Clarification**:
- **Timelock**: Builds tension by fragmenting a single perspective into multiple concurrent threads, culminating in an immediate problem.
- **Optionlock**: Increases tension by narrowing down options and focusing attention towards finding a functioning solution.
- **Selection Criteria**: Authors should choose a lock based on their comfort with building tension through delays (timelock) or constrained options (optionlock).

---

### Section 3: Overall Story Outcome: Success or Failure? Main Character Judgment: Good or Bad?

**Summary**: 
The story's conclusion is marked by the overall success or failure of the characters in achieving their initial goals, paired with the main character's personal fulfillment or lack thereof. This creates potential for various story outcomes, including personal triumphs and tragedies.

**Clarification**:
- **Overall Story Outcome**:
  - **Success**: Characters achieve their initial goal, regardless of personal satisfaction.
  - **Failure**: Characters fail to achieve their initial goal, even if they find it undesirable later.
- **Main Character Judgment**:
  - **Good**: Main character finds personal fulfillment by the end of the story.
  - **Bad**: Main character ends up with unresolved personal angst.
- **Outcome Combinations**: 
  - **Success/Good**: Uplifting story
  - **Failure/Bad**: Tragedy
  - **Success/Bad** or **Failure/Good**: Illustrate complex narratives with personal triumphs or tragedies.

This breakdown seeks to provide a comprehensive summary and explanation of the complex dynamics at play in story development as per the original text.
### Storyforming Structural Story Points
In the given text, the concept of story crafting is dissected into detailed and strategic points that help in the development of a comprehensive and engaging narrative. Below, we summarize and clarify the critical areas covered:

1. **Plot Dynamics**:
   - **Overall Story Driver**: Explains the main driver of the story, which can be either an action or a decision. It indicates the cause-effect relationship between actions and decisions that move the story forward. The inciting event in a story often dictates the kind of driver needed to resolve it, creating a bookended narrative structure. The choice between action or decision as a driver also impacts the background against which the main character operates, providing potential for various dramatic nuances.
   
2. **Overall Story Limit**:
   - **Timelock or Optionlock**: Describes the constraints that dictate the story’s ending, adding tension and guiding the main character’s decisions. A timelock is a deadline before which the problem must be resolved, increasing tension by fragmenting attention. On the other hand, an optionlock presents limited solutions to the problem, raising tension by focusing on solving the problem with limited resources. The nature of the obstacles encountered by the main character indicates which type of lock is in effect.
   
3. **Overall Story Outcome**:
   - **Success or Failure**: Reflects whether the story characters achieve their initial goals or not. It’s not about the worth of their success or failure but an objective evaluation of whether they achieved what they set out to do.
   - **Main Character Judgment**: Represents the personal fulfillment of the main character at the story’s end, providing a subjective angle to the story. This can be good or bad, leading to stories of personal triumph or personal tragedy based on the mix of success/failure and good/bad elements.

4. **Storyforming Structural Story Points**:
   - **Throughlines Selection**: Discusses the importance of clearly identifying characters in various storylines (Overall Story, Subjective Story, Main Character, and Impact Character) and evaluating their roles, actions, and relationships for thematic and structural development.
   - **Overall Story Throughline**: Focuses on the roles of characters in achieving the overall story concern. It emphasizes the separation of the main character and the impact character perspectives from the overall story to avoid confusion.
   - **Subjective Story Throughline**: Highlights the relationship between the main and impact characters, considering their interconnection instead of their individual personalities.
   - **Main Character Throughline**: Focuses solely on the main character’s intrinsic qualities that define their identity.
   - **Impact Character Throughline**: Centers on the impact character's influence on others, particularly the main character, and highlights their unique characteristics that influence the storyline.

The passage indicates the nuanced considerations authors must undertake to create a well-structured and engaging story, guiding them in choosing and developing different aspects of their narrative structure.
### Picking the proper Classes for the Throughlines in your Story
**Summary and Clarification:**

The Dramatica Theory of Storytelling emphasizes the importance of four key Throughlines: the Main Character, the Impact Character, the Subjective Story, and the Overall Story. These Throughlines offer different perspectives on the narrative, making it easier for the audience to engage and connect with the story. The perspectives are summarized as:

1. **I** (Main Character)
2. **YOU** (Impact Character)
3. **WE** (Subjective Story, which is the relationship between the Main and Impact Characters)
4. **THEY** (Overall Story, encompassing the broader narrative and all its characters)

Each Throughline has to be paired with a particular Class, representing the nature of the problem or conflict explored from that perspective. The four Classes are:

1. **Situation (Universe)**: Relates to external conditions.
2. **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: Pertains to internal beliefs or opinions.
3. **Activity (Physics)**: Focuses on external activities or actions.
4. **Manipulation (Psychology)**: Centers on internal processes, thinking, and manipulation.

Pairing a Throughline with a Class helps define the story's core thematic exploration. For instance, a Main Character's Throughline paired with the Situation Class would focus on the external challenges they face, whereas if paired with the Fixed Attitude Class, it would emphasize their internal beliefs.

![[Pasted image 20230909232723.png]]

There are certain fixed relationships within these pairings:
1. The Overall Story and the Subjective Story are dynamically linked.
2. The Main Character and the Impact Character share a dynamic relationship.

Whenever a Throughline is set with a Class, its dynamic pair also gets a preset Class. For example, if the Main Character Throughline is paired with the Situation Class, the Impact Character's Throughline automatically gets paired with the Fixed Attitude Class. 

To determine the best pairing for your story, the writer should adopt the respective perspective (I, YOU, WE, THEY) and evaluate the story against each Class's thematic concerns. For example, from the Main Character's perspective (I), you'd ask different questions depending on the Class, such as "What is my status?" for Situation, or "What am I afraid of?" for Fixed Attitude. 

This process aids in ensuring that the narrative resonates deeply with the audience and accurately portrays the intended thematic concerns. No pairing is inherently superior; the best choice depends on the specific message and feel the writer wants to convey.

### Selecting Plot Story Points
This extensive text discusses the strategies involved in selecting and developing plot story points in a narrative, which can be categorized as either Static or Progressive. Here is a summarized version, followed by a clarification of the main concepts:

#### Static Story Points

**Static Plot Story Points**:

1. **Goal**: Central objective in the narrative, usually aligning with the Concern of a Throughline. Depending on the throughline it's placed in, it influences how the audience perceives the primary focus of the story.
   
2. **Requirements**: Necessary steps or conditions to achieve the Goal. It may influence or be influenced by the Goal selected.
   
3. **Consequences**: What happens if the Goal isn't achieved, either emerging as a new development or continuing existing sufferings. The nature of consequences is dependent on the Goal and other story points.
   
4. **Forewarnings**: Indicators that consequences are approaching, creating tension, fear, or stress in the narrative. Their relationship with consequences can vary, and they should harmonize with the story's dynamics.
   
5. **Dividends**: Positive aspects or benefits experienced during the journey towards the Goal, which can either be directly related to the Goal or independent pleasant events happening concurrently.
   
6. **Costs**: Negative repercussions encountered while striving to attain the Goal, balancing the positive dividends.
   
7. **Prerequisites**: Essential conditions or elements needed to start fulfilling the Requirements, heavily influenced by the type of Requirements chosen.
   
8. **Preconditions**: Non-essential steps or elements that are imposed on the journey to achieve the Goal, often adding irritation or frustrations.

**Progressive Plot Story Points**: This category deals with the sequence and structuring of events (or Acts) within the Throughlines, affecting the story's overall impact on the audience.

The selection of these story points can be influenced by various dynamics and might vary greatly, sometimes even being determined by software calculations. The authors have the liberty to decide which aspects to emphasize, allowing them to tailor the story to their personal interests and storytelling style.

### Clarification

- **Plot Story Points**: Key components in a story that help in shaping the narrative. These are divided into Static (unchanging throughout the story) and Progressive (evolve as the story unfolds).

- **Throughlines**: These are different threads or narratives within the story that offer various perspectives or focus on different characters or elements. Each throughline has its "Concern," or main objective/focus.

- **Goal**: A pivotal static plot story point that represents the central objective of the story. The positioning of the Goal in a specific throughline determines the story's emphasis and audience perception.

- **Requirements, Consequences, Forewarnings, Dividends, Costs, Prerequisites, Preconditions**: These are other static plot story points that function as elements influencing the journey towards the Goal, adding depth, complexity, and nuance to the story.

- **Western Culture Influence**: The text notes that in Western culture, the Goal is often found in the Overall Story Throughline, but it can be placed in any of the four throughlines to create a varied narrative focus.

- **Storyencoding**: This seems to be a phase where the story points are illustrated or developed in detail, drawing from the author's personal experiences and insights.

- **Driver and Passenger Plot Story Points**: These seem to represent a categorization of the static plot story points, where "Driver" points have a more significant influence on the story's progression, and "Passenger" points act more as modifiers or secondary influencers.

- **Software Assistance in Selecting Plot Points**: The text hints at the existence of software that can assist authors in selecting appropriate plot points based on various dynamic conditions, presumably to create a more coherent and impactful narrative.

The text suggests a flexible and introspective approach towards selecting these story points, encouraging authors to rely on both structured methods and personal instincts and preferences to craft a compelling narrative.
#### Progressive Plot Story Points
### Progressive Plot Story Points Explained:

The **Progressive Plot Story Points** in the Grand Argument Story structure as conceptualized by Dramatica theory are essential for weaving a cohesive and compelling narrative. It's likened to a detailed exploration through a house where various "rooms" represent different scenes and elements of the story.

#### **Structure and Progression**:

1. **Three Floors (Acts)**: The overall story is broken down into three major acts, similar to the three floors in the house analogy. Each act houses significant developments that contribute to the overall progression of the story.
   
2. **Wings (Sequences)**: Within each act, there are two distinct sequences, akin to two wings on each floor of the house. These sequences contain a series of events that build up the larger act narrative, creating a pathway for the progression of the plot.
   
3. **Rooms (Scenes)**: Every sequence consists of four rooms, or scenes, where intricate details of the plot unfold. Each scene is a unit of the plot where characters interact, and critical actions happen, advancing the story point by point.

#### **Detailed Exploration**:

- **Event Investigation**: In each room (scene), the characters explore various events, akin to investigating different corners of a room in the house. These events are where the finer details of the plot are revealed, slowly building up the story layer by layer.
   
- **Sequential Exploration**: The characters cannot move to the next scene without fully exploring the current one, establishing a sequential and logical flow of story progression. This progression creates a sense of continuity and development as the plot unfolds.

#### **Influences on Characters' Decisions**:

- **Order of Presentation**: The order in which the story points are presented has a significant influence on the characters' decisions and the audience's perception. It can shape first impressions and affect the final outcome of the narrative.
   
- **Combination of Influences**: Characters' decisions are affected by both the events that transpired in the rooms and the sequence in which they were presented. This combination creates a dynamic narrative where each progressive story point builds upon the previous one, leading to a rich and detailed storyline.

#### **Critical Considerations**:

1. **Completeness**: The plot should cover all essential points, akin to visiting all rooms in the house, to offer a complete and satisfying story to the audience.
   
2. **Logical Order**: The sequence of visiting the rooms should reflect the intended outcome, maintaining a logical and coherent flow that supports the argument or message the story intends to convey.

3. **Act Level Attention**: Since acts are the broadest resolution of progressive story points, they require significant attention to ensure the narrative flows seamlessly, creating an impactful story progression.

4. **Throughline Synchronization**: It is vital to synchronize the various throughlines in the story, each representing different angles of the central narrative. By aligning the acts across all throughlines properly, authors can create a multidimensional and enriching narrative.

In essence, focusing on the **Progressive Plot Story Points** ensures that the story maintains a rhythmic and logical progression, with each element contributing meaningfully to the grand narrative, creating a rich and immersive storytelling experience.

![[Pasted image 20230909233121.png]]

### Selecting Thematic Story Points
The text discusses the process of selecting thematic story points, specifically focusing on how to choose an "Issue," which is a central thematic focus in a narrative's throughline.

#### **Clarification of Concepts**

1. **Issue**: This is the thematic core of a throughline, a focal point explored in depth throughout the story. Its exploration coupled with a counterpoint and a subsequent conclusion forms a premise. 

2. **Variations**: These are integral to the balanced structure of the thematic narrative, highlighting different angles of an issue without making a moral judgement. The audience interprets the values associated with these variations through the story's dynamics. 

3. **Thematic Quads**: A tool to facilitate the selection of an issue and its counterpoint, providing a clear, balanced argument central to the thematic exploration. They are structured as a group of 64 variations divided into sets and quads, which help to pinpoint the core issue of a throughline.

4. **Focus and Point of View**: The thematic focus (like "Morality") manifests through a conflict (e.g., Morality vs. Self-Interest), and the stance on it depends largely on the context. The focus and counterpoint must remain clear to maintain a balanced argument.

#### **Process of Selecting Thematic Story Points**

1. **Throughline Selection**: Begin by choosing a throughline without considering its class.
   
2. **Exploration of Variations**: Survey the sets of variations to identify one that resonates with the thematic concerns of the selected throughline.
   
3. **Quad Selection**: From the selected set, choose a quad that encapsulates the thematic subjects you wish to explore in that throughline.
   
4. **Selecting Conflict and Issue**: Within the chosen quad, identify a diagonal pair representing the thematic conflict. Select one as the focus (issue) and the other as the counterpoint.
   
5. **Detailed Exploration**: Engage in a detailed exploration of the chosen issue and its counterpoint, cultivating a nuanced and detailed narrative.

#### **Example Explained**

In the Morality/Self-Interest quad, the relationships between the variations are critical in determining the thematic focus and counterpoint. For instance, if Morality is chosen as the focus, the contrast between it and Self-Interest would be explored in terms of Attitude and Approach, which are the other two variations in that quad.

#### **Synopsis**

The selection of thematic story points involves a structured approach to pinpointing the core issue in a throughline. Through a careful consideration of variations and quads, writers can hone in on the central thematic focus and counterpoint, creating a nuanced narrative that resonates with audiences. This process starts with a generalized feeling and culminates in a decisive choice that influences the theme, character development, and plot progression in a story.

### Selecting Character Story Points
The text outlines the nuances of selecting character story points in storytelling, focusing on the Main Character's role in linking both the Overall and Subjective story aspects.

#### **Clarification of Concepts**

1. **Main Character's Unique Role**: The Main Character is central to illustrating both the Overall Story and Subjective story problems due to their possession of a key character element that is vital to both. Their involvement is essential in resolving these problems, and they can either embody the problem or the solution. Their role is not confined to pursuing the goal but holds a pivotal role in achieving it, either through change or steadfastness.

2. **The Problem Quad**: This is a set of four elements encompassing the Problem and its Solution along with the Focus (primary symptom of the problem) and the Direction (most appropriate treatment for the symptom). The Main Character might not embody the Problem element but will certainly possess one of the elements in this quad. 

3. **Change Characters and the Crucial Element**: In cases where the Main Character undergoes change, they either embody the problem or the solution. The change happens by either relinquishing or acquiring an essential element, thereby restoring balance between themselves and their environment. 

4. **Steadfast Characters and the Crucial Element**: In contrast, a steadfast Main Character perceives the imbalance as lying entirely in the environment and seeks to restore balance by relocating a particular element within the environment.

5. **Selection of Story Points**: The process of selecting story points is largely intuitive, influenced by the author's feelings and intents. Earlier choices in the story development process progressively restrict further choices, steering the story's argument logically. 

#### **Summary**

The text describes the critical role the Main Character plays in bridging the subjective and overall story arcs, emphasizing their pivotal role in problem-solving and achieving the story goal. Depending on the nature of the Main Character—whether they change or remain steadfast—they embody different elements from the "Problem Quad", a conceptual tool that contains elements representing the problem, solution, focus, and direction of the story. 

The change Main Character rectifies the imbalance in the story by either adopting or relinquishing a certain element, thereby altering their intrinsic nature. On the other hand, a steadfast Main Character perceives the issue as residing entirely in the external environment and works to restore balance there. 

The process of selecting these story points is largely guided by the author's intuition and personal intent, with the storyline's structure progressively influencing the selection of subsequent points based on preceding choices. This intuitive process can be assisted by using software like Dramatica to understand the interrelationships between different story points better.




![[Pasted image 20230909233550.png]]

## Stage 2: Storyencoding
### Clarification of Concepts:

1. **Storyencoding**: This is the process of converting the basic points of a story's structure into tangible aspects like characters, locations, and events that can be narrated. It essentially transforms abstract concepts from the storyform into elements that the audience can connect with.

2. **Storyforming and Storyencoding Process**: Often perceived as an inorganic way of crafting a story, the process, however, aids authors in developing a more coherent and balanced story structure. When authors start with a fascinating concept but find themselves stuck or encounter inconsistencies, referring to a pre-defined storyform can help them find suitable solutions and incorporate new ideas more seamlessly.

3. **Utilizing Dramatica Software**: This software assists in forming a well-balanced story structure by calculating the impacts of the chosen story points and determining the remaining necessary points to complete the story structure. It thereby assists in encoding different aspects of the story, including character goals and motivations, based on the initial selections made by the author.

4. **Role of Intuition**: Despite the structured approach, intuition still plays a significant role, especially when certain story points are chosen based on the feel or topic that resonates with the author. It's a tool to guide authors in building their stories organically from the intuitive concepts they begin with.

5. **Character, Theme, Plot, and Genre Encoding**: The later section of the text promises to offer advice on encoding various facets of a story, emphasizing the complexity of character encoding which necessitates finesse to create believable characters fulfilling their dramatic roles in the story.

#### Summary:

The text discusses the concept of "Storyencoding," a method of transforming fundamental structural points of a story into vivid and relatable elements such as characters, settings, and events. Although the process might seem non-organic initially, it aids authors, particularly when they encounter roadblocks or inconsistencies in their story development. The Dramatica software is highlighted as a useful tool in this process, helping to determine and balance various story points based on initial inputs, facilitating a smoother story development process. Additionally, the role of intuition in story development is acknowledged, suggesting a blend of structured planning and intuitive choices for a successful story crafting. The passage indicates that subsequent sections will delve into tips for effectively encoding different aspects of a story, with a focus on the intricate process of character encoding.
### Encoding Overall Story Characters
#### Clarification of Concepts:

1. **Storyform and Real Life**: The storyform is a representation of the mind's approach to problem-solving and is not a reflection of real life. It helps in illustrating how individuals tackle problems from both subjective (internal) and objective (external) perspectives.

2. **Subjective and Objective Views in Storytelling**: 
   - **Subjective View**: This is a familiar viewpoint where audiences can emotionally connect with the story, often substituting their own experiences for those portrayed in the narrative. This view lends credibility to the objective perspective.
   - **Objective View**: This is akin to an "out of body" experience, where audiences can observe the problem from an external standpoint. Authors use this view to make rational arguments and potentially offer advice to the audience, drawing from experiences depicted in the story.

3. **Role of Characters**: Characters in a story represent various facets of an argument that the author is making. These characters embody different considerations and approaches to the problem at hand. The arrangement and combination of characters should align with the author's contentions.

4. **Authorial Creativity and Utilization of Dramatica**: While the process may seem complex and manipulative, it facilitates a smoother flow of creativity, helping authors avoid inconsistencies and gaps in their narratives. When authors find themselves stuck, they can rely on Dramatica to guide them in weaving the story elements back together, promoting a seamless narrative progression.

#### Summary:

The text elucidates the concept of "storyform" as an analogy to the cognitive process of problem-solving, distinct from real life experiences. It highlights the importance of examining a problem from both subjective and objective viewpoints in a story. The subjective view allows audiences to emotionally relate to the story, potentially substituting their experiences with those depicted in the story. Meanwhile, the objective view offers a detached, rational perspective, enabling authors to present rational arguments and advice based on the depicted experiences. 

Characters in the story serve to encapsulate different facets of the central argument, representing various approaches to addressing the problem. They should be carefully constructed to align with the author's contentions. Despite its seemingly manipulative nature, this method supports authors in maintaining a consistent and hole-free narrative, fostering a natural flow of creativity. When faced with creative blocks, authors can resort to Dramatica, a tool that aids in navigating through different perspectives essential to the story's argument and helps in tracking character progression, thereby assisting authors in resuming their narrative seamlessly.
### Archetypal Characters
#### Clarification of Concepts:

1. **Archetypal Characters**: These characters are constructed with attributes from a singular "family" of characteristics, creating a clear and predictable pattern in their behavior and motivations. Despite their archetypal nature, they can be rich and multifaceted, and can facilitate a more streamlined story narrative where the audience easily anticipates character actions and reactions. This allows the author to utilize shortcuts in character descriptions as the audience can automatically fill in the expected details.

2. **Creating a Story with Archetypes**: Using archetypes doesn't mean sacrificing depth or intrigue. A sample narrative is suggested using eight archetypal roles: 
   - **Protagonist (Jane)**: The central figure who is driven to stop terrorists. 
   - **Antagonist (Johann)**: A character diametrically opposed to Jane's mission, in this case, the leader of the terrorists and Jane's ex-lover. 
   - **Skeptic (Father, the Senator)**: A character who doubts Jane's success.
   - **Sidekick (Supervisor)**: A person who staunchly supports Jane in her mission.
   - **Contagonist (Sheila, the Computer Whiz)**: A character who tempts Jane with alternative strategies.
   - **Guardian (Seasoned Cop)**: A protector figure who guides Jane.
   - **Reason (Ex-Con)**: Advocates for a classic, proven approach.
   - **Emotion (Master of Oriental Martial Arts)**: Encourages Jane to follow her instincts and feelings.

3. **Effectiveness of the Archetypal Story Structure**: The structure, while frequently used, remains effective due to its simplicity and functionality. When paired with the Dramatica theory, which allows for mixing and matching characteristics to create complex characters, the narrative possibilities are virtually limitless, ensuring a cohesive and compelling story.

#### Summary:

The text discusses the concept of archetypal characters in storytelling, emphasizing that despite their predictable patterns, they can be fresh and fascinating with detailed explorations of their characteristics. These characters enable authors to craft narratives with minimal exposition, allowing the audience to easily anticipate character dynamics, hence facilitating the use of descriptive shortcuts. The article goes on to demonstrate how a story can be crafted using eight distinct archetypal characters, each playing a crucial role in advancing the narrative. Furthermore, the narrative suggests that the use of such characters, especially in alignment with Dramatica theory, can result in narratives with rich, complex characters and well-structured, effective storytelling.

### Complex Characters
In the given excerpt, the concept of building complex characters in storytelling is explored. Here's a summary and a clarification of the main points mentioned:

#### Summary:

1. **Complex Characters**: The depth of characters doesn't depend on their traits but how these traits are arranged. Complex characters are crafted with diverse and sometimes conflicting traits, making them more engaging to audiences, compared to predictable archetypal characters. The analogy of a Scrabble game is used to illustrate the creation of characters with varying traits, suggesting a richer narrative experience compared to repetitive archetypes.
   
2. **Archetypal Characters**: These characters have their place in storytelling, especially when the focus is on the plot or theme. Using archetypes can save time and space as audiences are already familiar with them, but relying too much on them can lead to narratives filled with one-dimensional characters, which might not be as engaging.
   
3. **Four Dimensional Characters**: Characters, whether archetypal or complex, operate at four levels or dimensions: Motivations, Methodologies, Evaluation Means, and Purposes. Archetypes have a fixed characteristic in each dimension. Complex characters are created by swapping elements between archetypes or by varying the number of characteristics in each dimension, leading to unpredictable and layered personas.
   
4. **Character Construction Guidelines**: When creating characters, it is advised to avoid giving a character more than one element of a dynamic pair or multiple elements from the same quad to prevent conflicting viewpoints and weakening their role in the story.
   
5. **Overall Story Throughline Characteristics**: The narrative focuses on addressing inequities and their resolutions. Among the four central elements (Problem, Solution, Focus, and Direction), one becomes the Crucial Element around which the story revolves. The narrative explores the problem from various angles through different characters, with particular attention on Main and Impact characters, who play dual roles in both subjective and overall storylines.

#### Clarification:

1. **Complex Characters**: This portion discusses the richness that comes with creating characters with diverse and conflicting traits. They are likened to creating words in Scrabble where utilizing various combinations makes the game (or story) more engaging.

2. **Archetypal Characters**: These are conventional characters that audiences are familiar with. They can sometimes serve a purpose, especially when the story aims to focus more on the plot or theme, but their overuse can lead to stale narratives.

3. **Four Dimensional Characters**: Characters can be crafted with depth through four dimensions. Creating complex characters involves mixing elements across these dimensions, which makes them less predictable compared to archetypes.

4. **Character Construction Guidelines**: It advises against giving conflicting characteristics to a character as it can cause inconsistency in their roles within the story, making it harder for the audience to connect with them.

5. **Overall Story Throughline Characteristics**: This part of the text describes how the story explores the main problem from different perspectives through various characters. The Main and Impact characters play significant roles as they influence both the subjective perspectives and the overall story dynamics.

The excerpt emphasizes crafting a rich narrative by balancing complex and archetypal characters, and exploring the story problem through various dimensions and perspectives, focusing on achieving a resolution that brings balance to the storyline's central inequity.
### Encoding Subjective Characters
#### Summary:

The passage discusses the intricacies of creating subjective characters in a story and differentiates them from the overall story characters. Subjective characters, which embody personal views and attitudes, often merge with the objective functions of overall story characters, which can sometimes cause redundancy and overlook important narrative aspects. Depending on the medium (movies or novels), either the subjective or the objective argument might suffer due to differing emphases. Additionally, the passage notes that the main character in a story doesn't have to be the protagonist and emphasizes the versatility this offers in character development. The main and impact characters serve to represent opposing viewpoints on a central issue, illustrating the consequences of change and steadfastness.

#### Clarification:

1. **Encoding Subjective Characters**: This section warns against merging the subjective aspects of characters (their personal viewpoints and attitudes) with their roles in the overall storyline. It highlights the importance of delineating these aspects to avoid narrative redundancy and to present a well-rounded argument in the story. Depending on the medium, one of these aspects might be favored over the other, but the passage advocates for a balanced approach to create a comprehensive impact on the audience.

2. **The Main Character is Not Necessarily the Protagonist**: This part emphasizes that the main character, with whom the audience identifies, doesn't necessarily have to be the protagonist. It encourages writers to explore other combinations, suggesting that the subjective characters encompass a range of roles, representing different attitudes rather than approaches, enriching the narrative experience.

3. **"We're Both Alike, You and I..."**: Here, the relationship between the main and impact characters is explored. Despite representing opposing views on a central issue, they are closely related because they address the same issue. Their interactions often underline their similarities and differences, leading to a dynamic and potentially conflicting relationship, which forms a pivotal part of the narrative.

4. **Evil Twins?**: This section dispels the notion that the impact character should be viewed as a negative counterpart to the main character. It illustrates that the primary function of these characters is to depict contrasting approaches to the same issue, highlighting the repercussions of change and steadfastness in their perspectives. This presents a richer view of the narrative conflict and resolution.

The excerpt encourages writers to maintain a distinct representation of subjective characters, exploring diverse combinations and relationships to build a more nuanced and engaging story.
### Encoding Mental Sex

#### Summary:

The excerpt delves into the concept of "Mental Sex" in the context of storytelling and explores the inherent differences in how men and women approach problem-solving. Men generally have a linear approach, focusing on specific goals, steps, and gathering evidence. This method is spatial, looking at distinct parts that must come together to solve an issue. On the other hand, women typically use a holistic problem-solving method, emphasizing relationships between things and altering dynamics rather than structure. This method is temporal, concentrating on changing the direction of the forces that create the problem. However, both genders can utilize either technique depending on experience, training, or conscious choice. The fundamental distinction lies in the innate inclination of the brain's operating system, which may be linear or holistic. 

A point-by-point comparison is provided, highlighting distinct tendencies like females concentrating on "why" and males focusing on "how," "when," and "what." The fundamental point is that these tendencies, determined by mental sex, might be overshadowed by learned techniques.

Furthermore, the passage discusses the dynamic between the audience and the main character in a story. When the audience engages with the overall story, they perceive it externally. In contrast, when they empathize with the main character, they experience the narrative from an internal perspective. For an audience to fully connect with the main character, that character must have a complete mind for the audience to "possess." This deep connection enables the story to have a profound emotional impact on the audience.

#### Clarification:

1. **Encoding Mental Sex**: The term "Mental Sex" doesn't refer to gender but rather the innate problem-solving tendency of an individual, which is typically linear for men and holistic for women. This inclination is described as foundational and often contrasts with consciously chosen or learned problem-solving methods.

2. **Point-by-Point Comparison**: This section provides specific examples to distinguish between male and female problem-solving tendencies. It's essential to understand these as general tendencies, not fixed traits for every individual.

3. **Building a Mind for the Audience to Possess**: This segment explains the intimate relationship between the audience and the main character in a story. It emphasizes the idea that for a story to truly resonate, the audience needs to "possess" or "empathize" with the main character's mind and feelings deeply. This engrossment allows the audience to experience the story's emotions and events as if they were their own.

| Female Attribute                     | Male Attribute                                      |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Looks at motivations                 | Looks at purposes                                   |
| Tries to see connections             | Tries to gather evidence                            |
| Sets up conditions                   | Sets up requirements                                |
| Determines the leverage points       | Breaks a job into steps that can restore balance    |
| Seeks fulfillment                    | Seeks satisfaction                                  |
| Concentrates on "Why"                | Concentrates on "How", "When", and "What"           |
| Puts the issues in context           | Argues the issues                                   |
| Tries to hold it all together        | Tries to pull it all together                       |
### Encoding Theme
**Summary:**

The article discusses the concept of encoding theme in storytelling. Encoding theme is about subtly conveying an argument or message without explicitly stating it or manipulating the audience. The theme gives depth and meaning to a story, beyond just a sequence of events. It provides a lens through which events are interpreted, grounding them in a specific context or moral argument.

For effective thematic encoding, it's crucial to:
1. Understand the specifics of the theme, often represented as a conflict between two opposing ideas (e.g., Morality vs. Self-interest).
2. Present both sides of the conflict without bias, allowing the audience to evaluate them.
3. Introduce the theme multiple times, preferably once per act, to let the audience grasp its significance in different contexts.
4. Use subtle means of presentation, like background events or incidental characters, to keep the theme from overshadowing the main narrative.

The article also highlights encoding themes for different storylines or throughlines:
1. **Overall Story Theme:** An emotional argument applicable to all characters. It should be depicted objectively, using background incidents or side characters.
2. **Main Character Theme:** Focuses on the main character's personal journey. It should be subtle and make the audience question how they'd react in similar situations.
3. **Impact Character Theme:** Centers on evaluating the impact character's actions and decisions.
4. **Subjective Story Theme:** Explores the relationship between the main and impact characters, discussing the varying ways this relationship can be interpreted.

**Clarification:**

Thematic encoding is the technique of embedding a theme or message into a story subtly. Instead of directly stating the moral or message, authors use a combination of events, character actions, dialogues, and other narrative elements to imply it. This helps in making the story more engaging and allows the audience to infer the deeper meaning, leading to a more immersive and reflective experience.

### Encoding Plot
**Summary:**

The process of encoding Static Plot Story Points involves giving specific context and meaning to generic story elements, ensuring they align with the intended theme and message of the story. While the specific context in which these points appear is a matter of Storyweaving, the actual encoding remains consistent. For instance, a Goal in a story might be "Obtaining" something, such as diamonds, a diploma, or love. How this goal is portrayed can vary depending on the story's theme. Using the presidency as an example, the Goal can be adjusted to fit different narratives about a presidential character – from wanting to obtain the presidency, to playing the role of a president, or seeking to change their nature as a president. It's crucial for authors to ensure accurate encoding as incorrect encoding can distort the intended message and weaken the overall impact of the story.
#### Encoding Progressive Plot Story Points
![[Pasted image 20230909235157.png]]

**Clarification and Summary:**

In the process of crafting a story, encoding Progressive Plot Story Points entails delineating the path that characters traverse throughout the narrative, marked by critical "Signposts" and the "Journeys" between them. This approach facilitates in plotting the aspects of scenes in the story.

**Concepts Introduced:**

1. **Signposts**: These are critical markers within the story, which signify significant phases or turning points that characters encounter. They essentially guide the flow of the story.
   
2. **Journeys**: These are the experiences characters undergo as they move from one signpost to another. They encapsulate the characters' progression and growth throughout the story.

In the given example, the story is structured with four signposts and three journeys between them, mapping out a path from "Learning" to "Obtaining". This structure aids writers in creating a cohesive narrative, and it can adapt to both three-act and four-act structures, providing both a roadmap (signposts) and involving the audience in the experience (journeys).

**Example Story Outline:**

1. **Signpost #1 (Learning)**: Characters discover a series of diamond robberies, marking the beginning of their journey.
   
2. **Journey #1 (Learning to Understanding)**: As characters delve deeper into the robberies, they begin to notice patterns and connections, suggesting a larger conspiracy at play.
   
3. **Signpost #2 (Understanding)**: Characters understand that a multinational consortium is orchestrating the heists, expanding the scope of their mission.
   
4. **Journey #2 (Understanding to Doing)**: With their newfound understanding, the characters strategize to infiltrate the consortium, gaining detailed insights into its operations.
   
5. **Signpost #3 (Doing)**: The characters manage to infiltrate the consortium, gearing up for more direct action.
   
6. **Journey #3 (Doing to Obtaining)**: Getting closer to the consortium, the characters work from the inside, eventually gaining the trust of the consortium members and participating in a heist while coordinating with their organization to inform the authorities.
   
7. **Signpost #4 (Obtaining)**: In the climax, the characters successfully retrieve the stolen diamonds, achieving their goal.

This structure is a part of the Dramatica theory, which serves as a tool for writers to organize their narratives effectively, ensuring a vibrant and immersive storyline that engages the audience by creating a live, evolving journey through the defined signposts.
### Main Character Throughline Plot Progression
#### Clarification and Summary

In the context of narrative theory, particularly as expounded in the "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story", the "Main Character Throughline Plot Progression" focuses on depicting the stages of growth that the main character undergoes throughout the storyline. It emphasizes that the main character serves as a lens through which the audience perceives and experiences the events of the story, thus enabling a deeper connection and immersion.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Main Character Throughline**: This is a narrative tool that portrays the progression of the main character's personal growth journey throughout the storyline.
2. **Plot Progression**: Describes the sequential stages or phases in the storyline, often capturing the changes or developments in the main character's perspective or circumstances.

#### Example Story Progression:

In the illustrated example, the main character, a law enforcement department chief, navigates a series of events and internal conflicts characterized by four primary stages: Past, Progress, Present, and Future. Here's a summarized journey of the main character:

1. **Signpost #1 (Past)**:
   - **Situation**: The main character is concerned about the history of corruption within his department.
   - **Action**: Begins investigating previous instances of consortium influences in the department.

2. **Journey #1 (Past to Progress)**:
   - **Growth**: Utilizes the gathered historical data to get closer to infiltrating the Consortium.

3. **Signpost #2 (Progress)**:
   - **Decision**: Chooses to personally go undercover, doubting the integrity of his agents.

4. **Journey #2 (Progress to Present)**:
   - **Transformation**: Climbs ranks within the Consortium, gaining a significant position of power and influence, yet begins to face ethical dilemmas.

5. **Signpost #3 (Present)**:
   - **Conflict**: Faced with a moral dilemma involving the use of illicit funds to save a Children's Hospital.

6. **Journey #3 (Present to Future)**:
   - **Compromise**: Violates his ethical code for the greater good, but manages to undermine some of the Consortium's plans, albeit not completely dismantling it.

7. **Signpost #4 (Future)**:
   - **Reflection**: Despite a seemingly successful mission and an opportunity for a political career, the character is left internally conflicted and morally bereft, grappling with his ethical compromises.

In essence, the storyline explores the personal evolution and moral quandaries of the main character as he navigates a complex and corrupt environment, reflecting the intricacies of human nature and ethical complexities in the process. This progression serves to create a rich, nuanced narrative that encourages audiences to empathize with and understand the multidimensional aspects of the main character's journey.
### Impact Character Throughline Plot Progression
#### Clarification and Summary

In this portion of the narrative theory, the focus is on mapping out the progression of the Impact Character's journey through the story, within the frame of a "Fixed Attitude" or mindset. The role of the Impact Character is to influence the Main Character's development in some way, and their presence in the story can be more of a psychological or philosophical force than a physical one.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Fixed Attitude (Mind)**: This suggests that the Impact Character has a certain mindset or perspective that governs their actions and reactions throughout the narrative.
2. **Type Order**: This outlines the stages or phases that the Impact Character goes through, charting a journey from spontaneous responses to deep subconscious reflection.
   
#### The Impact Character's Journey:

1. **Signpost #1 - Impulsive Responses [Preconscious]**:
   - This stage highlights the Impact Character's spontaneous and instinctual reactions, which might not be thoroughly contemplated or rationalized.

2. **Journey #1 (Impulsive Responses to Contemplation)**:
   - This marks a transition from impulsive actions to a phase where the Impact Character begins to reflect and deliberate on their responses consciously.

3. **Signpost #2 - Contemplation [Conscious]**:
   - At this juncture, the Impact Character actively thinks about and considers their actions, possibly weighing the implications and outcomes before acting.

4. **Journey #2 (Contemplation to Memory)**:
   - This transition signals a shift from active contemplation to a phase where past experiences and memories start influencing the Impact Character's mindset and actions.

5. **Signpost #3 - Memory**:
   - This phase indicates a period where the Impact Character is significantly influenced by their past memories and experiences, which guide their present actions and decisions.

6. **Journey #3 (Memory to Subconscious)**:
   - Here, the journey goes deeper into the psyche of the Impact Character, transitioning from the influence of past memories to a more subconscious level of functioning.

7. **Signpost #4 - Subconscious**:
   - In the final stage, the Impact Character operates from a subconscious level, possibly indicating deep-seated beliefs, fears, or desires influencing their actions and impact on the story.

Overall, this structure outlines the transformation and development of the Impact Character as they move from instinctual responses to a deeper, subconscious level of operation, influencing the narrative and possibly the main character's journey in a significant way. This progression adds depth and complexity to the story, showcasing the multi-faceted nature of characters within a narrative.
### Subjective Story Throughline Plot Progression

#### Clarification and Summary:

This passage elaborates on the “Subjective Story Throughline” in a story structure, a concept from the theory of Dramatica. This throughline focuses on the development of the relationship between the Main Character and the Impact Character throughout the storyline. It's best crafted after the individual arcs of the Main and Impact characters have been developed, as it leans on the dynamics established in those arcs.

#### **Overview:**

- **Main Character:** Initially, a steadfast law enforcement figure with a clear code of ethics.
- **Impact Character:** Holds a more fluid view of the relationship between crime and law enforcement.
- **Setting:** The backdrop of increasing criminal activities by an entity referred to as the Consortium.
- **Subjective Story Throughline:** This illustrates the relationship dynamics and growth between the Main and Impact Characters, showcasing how their differing perspectives come into conflict and influence each other. The Type Order in this throughline is "Manipulation (Psychology)" and progresses as: Developing A Plan, Conceiving An Idea, Playing A Role, and Changing One’s Nature.

#### **Progression and Conflicts:**

1. **Developing A Plan [Conceptualizing]:**
   - Both characters clash on how to approach the issue of organized crime. Their different perspectives on law enforcement and crime lead to a conflict about the strategies to deal with the Consortium.
   
2. **Conceiving An Idea:**
   - As they become aware of escalating criminal activities, they argue about the methods to deal with the situation. While the Main Character wants a direct approach to eradicate the Consortium, the Impact Character proposes diverting the Consortium's criminal activities to make it unsustainable. Ultimately, they decide to use the Main Character as a mole, each believing this would prove their viewpoint correct.
   
3. **Playing A Role [Being]:**
   - The undercover operation puts a strain on their relationship. The Main Character grows impatient, embodying his undercover role more and more, while the Impact Character becomes a moral sounding board, questioning the Main Character's actions and decisions.
   
4. **Changing One's Nature [Becoming]:**
   - The undercover operation brings moral dilemmas to the fore. The Main Character finds himself having to compromise on his ethics to maintain his cover. The climax sees a deep conflict about the decisions made during the operation, with the Impact Character pointing out the change in the Main Character's moral stance. This confrontation reveals a transformation in the Main Character's nature, indicating a loss of moral ground, which leaves him questioning his sense of righteousness.

#### **Conclusion:**

The narrative tracks the evolving relationship between the Main and the Impact Character as they navigate moral dilemmas and strategic differences in their approach to handling organized crime. The transformation and conflict in their relationship mirror the complexities of the choices they have to make, offering a nuanced exploration of the human response to ethical dilemmas in a high-stakes scenario. The Main Character, in the end, undergoes a significant change, questioning his earlier steadfastness in his moral code. This transformation is both a testament to his experience during the operation and an indication of a significant shift in his character arc, marking a nuanced evolution in his personal journey.

### Encoding Genre 

#### Clarification and Summary:

##### Clarification:
In this passage, the discussion centers around two primary aspects of story creation: the development of a unique Genre and the influence of Medium and Format on storytelling. 

1. **Encoding Genre**: 
    - **Role of Throughlines**: Only four structural story points, termed Throughlines, significantly influence the creation of a story's Genre. 
    - **Development over time**: A story's Genre should not be set rigidly from the start. It should begin as a broad concept and gradually refine and evolve into a unique Genre as the story progresses. 
    - **Balancing uniqueness and audience reception**: Trying to create an entirely unique Genre at the outset can alienate the audience, but failing to add unique elements as the story progresses can result in an unmemorable story. A balanced approach where the story starts with a general concept and gradually carves out its unique niche is recommended.

2. **Medium and Format**:
    - **Impact on storytelling**: The medium of storytelling can either limit or enhance the tools available to an author, and the story needs to be transmitted across a medium to reach the audience.
    - **Varieties of mediums and formats**: Different mediums offer different utilities and constraints, and various formats within a medium can offer distinct dramatic opportunities and limitations.
    - **Customization of encoding process**: Understanding the specifics of mediums and formats allows for a tailored encoding process to maximize the benefits of each.

##### Summary:

### Storyweaving Static Story Points
### Clarification and Summary:

#### Clarification:
In this passage, the concept of Storyweaving is discussed with a focus on the integration of static story points into the scenes of a story.

1. **Static Story Points**:
    - **Definition and Integration**: These are aspects of the story that need to be presented at least once but can be revisited multiple times throughout the narrative to enhance the story experience.
    - **Throughline Integration**: It is noted that the Throughlines are usually already illustrated in the material encoded for each signpost and journey.
    - **Frequency of Appearance**: While they need to appear at least once, their repetition can help maintain audience engagement and help in creating a richer narrative.
   
2. **Techniques for Incorporation**:
    - **Goal Setting**: The goal can be stated clearly at the beginning, or it might be hinted at or revisited throughout the story to maintain audience focus.
    - **The Rule of Threes**: This writing technique suggests that repeating an element three times can be an effective way to embed it in the story.
    - **Audience Engagement**: Offering hints or partial information about a static story point can engage the audience, letting them piece the information together themselves. 
    - **Creative Integration**: Various creative methods can be employed to weave these story points into the scenes, including using action, dialogue, visuals, or even changing the typography in a book.

3. **Utilization of Structure**: 
    - **Obligation to Structure**: It's important to make sure that all necessary story points are included in the narrative to maintain a coherent structure.
    - **Avoiding Clichés**: Authors are encouraged to integrate these story points in unique and non-cliché ways to make the story more interesting.

#### Summary:
The passage discusses the technique of Storyweaving, emphasizing the need to effectively incorporate static story points into a narrative. These story points are elements that must be presented at least once within the story, although they can be revisited or hinted at multiple times to create a richer, more engaging narrative experience. Various techniques are suggested for incorporating these points, including stating the goal early on, utilizing the "Rule of Threes" to maintain audience focus, and creatively integrating points through different methods like action or dialogue. The passage underscores the importance of fulfilling the structural obligations of the story while encouraging authors to integrate these points in innovative and non-cliché ways to enhance the storytelling experience.

### Storyweaving Characters
### Clarification and Summary:

#### Clarification:
The passage discusses how to weave characters into your story, distinguishing between the approaches to subjective characters and overall story characters:

1. **Subjective Characters**:
   - **Easier to Weave**: Incorporating these characters is relatively straightforward as much of their character is already integrated into the story through the creation of scenes based on main and impact character throughlines.
   - **Static Story Points**: These can further flesh out the subjective characters, completing their integration into the narrative.

2. **Overall Story Characters**:
   - **Functional Requirement**: These characters have distinct functions and must exercise them to be integrated into the narrative.
   - **Usage of Archetypes**:
     - **Introduction and Dismissal**: Each of the eight archetypes needs to be introduced and dismissed properly to delineate their function and outcome in the story.
     - **Interactions**: The archetypes must interact to highlight effective problem-solving techniques, with a special focus on dynamic pairs (e.g., Protagonist and Antagonist) and the steps of conflict development: setup, conflict, and resolution.

3. **Structuring Character Events**:
   - **Alignment with Storyweaving Scenes**: The discussion suggests an alignment of twenty-eight character events with twenty-eight Storyweaving scenes, although this isn't a strict rule and various other methods can be employed.
   - **Risk of Monotony**: This method, while ensuring structural coherence, can lead to a monotone narrative, and alternative structures might be used to vary the narrative tone and pace.

#### Summary:
The passage talks about the strategies involved in incorporating characters into a story, focusing on the differences between weaving subjective characters and overall story characters into the narrative. Subjective characters are relatively easier to integrate into the story as their traits are already established through main and impact character throughlines. In contrast, overall story characters, particularly those based on archetypes, have to be introduced and exercised according to their functions in the story, involving a series of events highlighting their interactions and resolutions.

A systematic approach is proposed where twenty-eight character events are nicely dovetailed with twenty-eight Storyweaving scenes. However, this approach carries a risk of creating a monotonic feel to the story. The passage concludes by indicating that there are multiple ways to convey the structure of a story, potentially avoiding a monotonic narrative and encouraging exploration of other strategies to craft a well-rounded story.
### Storyweaving And Storytelling
### Clarification and Summary:

#### Clarification:
In the context of the Dramatica theory, the passage discusses various techniques used in storytelling, particularly focusing on storyweaving. These techniques are grouped into spatial and temporal categories:

1. **Spatial Techniques**:
   - **Building Size**: Modifying the perceived scope or size of a concept or element throughout the story.
   - **Red Herrings**: Including elements designed to mislead the audience regarding the importance of something.
   - **Meaning Reversals**: Shifting the context to change the perceived meaning of a situation or element.
   - **Message Reversals**: Adjusting the context to convey a different message while retaining the same structure.
   
2. **Temporal Techniques**:
   - **Building Importance**: Changing the impact of elements over time.
   - **Non-Causality**: Creating a gap between audience expectations and the logical outcome of a situation.
   - **Out of Sequence Experiences**: Presenting events in a non-linear fashion, forcing the audience to re-evaluate their understanding continually.
   - **Flashbacks and Flash-forwards**: Using time jumps to either enhance audience experience or affect character perception.

The text emphasizes that the application of these techniques is part of the art of storytelling and is subject to the creative discretion of the storyteller. The passage suggests that these techniques can be manipulated flexibly to convey the underlying argument of the story by the end.

#### Summary:
The passage outlines different techniques of storytelling as explained in the Dramatica theory, categorizing them into spatial and temporal techniques. The spatial techniques include changing the perceived size or importance of elements and reversing meanings or messages by altering contexts. The temporal techniques involve altering the perceived importance or causality of events, presenting events out of sequence, and utilizing flashbacks and flash-forwards to influence the narrative and the audience's experience. 

Examples from popular culture, including movies and TV shows, illustrate these techniques vividly. Ultimately, the passage underscores that the utilization of these Storyweaving techniques is a flexible and artistic aspect of storytelling, allowing for innovation and creativity without rigid restrictions. Moreover, the narrative hints at further discussions on how medium and format can influence the application of these techniques in storytelling.
### Tips for Short Stories
#### Clarification and Summary:

#### Clarification:
The passage discusses tips for crafting short stories using the Dramatica theory's guidelines, which usually encompasses a Grand Argument Storyform, a comprehensive structure addressing multiple aspects of a narrative. When writing a short story, it's advised not to arbitrarily remove sections of the Grand Argument Story, but instead limit the scope of the argument being presented. This limitation can be approached in two ways: focusing on a single class (or perspective) or reducing the level of resolution to explore only specific elements of characters or themes.

The limitations have the following effects on the story:
1. **Single Class Focus**: By concentrating on only one point of view (Main Character, Impact Character, Overall Story Throughline, or Subjective Story Throughline), the argument is presented but only validated within the confines of the selected perspective. This approach results in a one-sided but coherent argument.
2. **Limited Resolution**: By removing an entire level of analysis, a part of the story's exploration is obscured, making the argument appear somewhat shallow, but it maintains depth in the areas that are illuminated.

For ultra-short stories, these two methods can be combined, sacrificing both depth and perspective but still crafting a story that encodes both reason and emotion within a minimalistic structure of four dramatic units in a quad, thus creating a pattern that can be interpreted by the audience.

#### Summary:
The passage provides guidance on constructing short stories using the Dramatica theory, emphasizing the need to limit the scope of the argument rather than cutting parts arbitrarily. This limitation can be achieved by focusing on a single class, thereby presenting a one-sided argument, or by reducing the level of resolution, offering a somewhat shallow but focused exploration of the topic. Ultra-short stories may combine these methods, narrowing down to a minimal story structure containing four dramatic units, which still convey a coherent story with encoded reason and emotion that can engage the audience. This minimalistic approach allows for the creation of numerous minimal stories that can effectively convey a narrative within a restricted framework.

3. **Swapping Roles**: This strategy helps in altering the dynamics of character relationships while keeping the structure intact, which can create variations across seasons without any repeats, holding the attention of a loyal audience.

4. **Characters of the Week**: Occasionally focusing stories on different characters or even introducing a whole new ensemble for a single episode can add freshness to the series. But it advises using this technique sparingly to maintain the core lore of the series.
   
5. **Plot in Episodic Series**: It suggests breaking away from the established formulaic dramatic circuits to make plots seem more inspired and avoid audience boredom.
   
6. **Theme in Episodic Series**: Instead of revolving around news topics, the theme of each episode should be distinct, clearly defined, and fully explored in essential human ways to emotionally engage the audience.

7. **Genre in Episodic Series**: To keep the concept from becoming stale, it recommends rotating through different throughlines each week and occasionally shifting genres to spice up the series.

Overall, the passage suggests a balanced approach of maintaining continuity while introducing fresh elements in character dynamics, plot structures, and themes to sustain viewer interest and prevent the series from becoming predictable and stale. It encourages creators to think beyond established conventions and explore innovative approaches to storytelling in episodic television series.
### Tips for Multi-Story Ensemble Series and Soap Operas
#### Clarification and Summary

#### Clarification:

In this segment, different structures and strategies for crafting multi-story ensemble series or soap operas are discussed. The narrative could incorporate subplots, which are supplementary narratives that explore issues tangential to the main story. These subplots may either complement or counterpoint the main story, and they revolve around characters intrinsic to the main story, but not the main character.

Besides subplots, multi-story series can also feature entirely separate stories that may or may not intersect at certain points. These could be presented simultaneously, forming a sort of "spatial anthology". An even more complex format incorporates both subplots and separate stories, utilizing characters from the principal story as well as new characters.

The passage also highlights the potential complexity arising from stretching time across episodes, where stories and subplots may extend over several episodes, creating intricate cross-dynamics. It underscores the necessity for clear storytelling to help the audience navigate the different narratives and understand the characters' roles in each context.

#### Summary:

The passage presents guidance on developing multi-story ensemble series or soap operas, focusing on the utilization of subplots and various story formats. The key points are as follows:

1. **Subplots**:
   - Less resolved than the main story and involve characters from the main story.
   - Not essential to the main plot but provide a deeper exploration of issues related to the main narrative.
   - Can complement or contradict the main plot, offering broader scope or counterpoints to the main argument.
   - Should be introduced and concluded thoughtfully within the timeline of the main story.
   
2. **Multi-Story Formats**:
   - Separate stories can exist independently or be intertwined but only intersecting incidentally.
   - Can present a "spatial anthology," where multiple narratives are unfolded simultaneously.
   - The most complex format involves both subplots and separate narratives utilizing both principal and new characters.
   
3. **Stretching Time**:
   - Stories and subplots can extend over several episodes, sometimes overlapping and intertwining.
   - Requires careful storytelling to ensure the audience can follow the diverse narratives and understand character roles in each context.

Overall, the passage outlines strategies for creating rich and engaging multi-story ensemble series, emphasizing the importance of well-structured subplots and narrative formats, and the necessity of clear and coherent storytelling to navigate the complexities of such formats.
### Tips for Novels
#### Clarification and Summary

#### Clarification:

In this passage, the concept of "stretchy time" is introduced, referring to the flexible nature of time in novels where readers have the control to dictate the pace at which they navigate through the story. Unlike plays where the narrative unfolds at a set pace, in novels, readers can revisit sections, skip parts, or take breaks, allowing them to engage with the material in a personal and individualized manner. 

Given this fluidity of time, novelists have a broader scope to explore different facets of storytelling including diving deep into areas of personal interest, developing complex characters, emphasizing a message, or indulging in a fantasy openly. Despite this freedom, the passage suggests that if the intention is to narrate a coherent story, a well-structured "storyform" needs to be embedded within the narrative. However, the malleable nature of time in novels allows authors to deviate from the central narrative without the risk of losing their audience, fostering a more explorative and indulgent narrative style.

#### Summary:

The excerpt discusses the unique advantage of "stretchy time" in novel-writing, where authors are not constrained by the rigid time structures typically seen in plays or films. This attribute allows readers to consume the story at their chosen pace, revisiting or bypassing sections as they wish. This flexible time framework grants authors the liberty to wander off the main narrative path occasionally, permitting them to explore personal interests, develop characters profoundly, or delve deeply into specific messages or fantasies, without the immediate risk of losing the audience's interest. Nonetheless, to present a cohesive story, the novel should incorporate a well-articulated "storyform" at some point, ensuring a structured narrative amidst the creative detours.
### Tips for Motion Pictures

Furthermore, the text explains the techniques of portraying characters in absentia and executing hand-offs, where the viewpoints or characteristics of absent characters are represented in various ways, maintaining the narrative's tension and continuity. It also mentions the potential pitfalls and nuances of handling hand-offs effectively, including ensuring smooth transitions and avoiding narrative gaps. These techniques aim to preserve the narrative's richness and depth, even when characters are physically absent or have been written out of the story.
## Stage 4: Story Reception

### Writing for Oneself
This text discusses the role of audience perception and its importance when crafting a story, according to the Dramatica Theory of Story. Here is a summarized and clarified version:

### Audience Reception in Storytelling

#### Understanding Your Audience
When you venture into storytelling, considering how your audience will receive the story becomes paramount. It's not just about conveying a message, but understanding how that message will be interpreted and perceived by your audience. Depending on your intent, you might want to educate, influence, or perhaps provoke your audience to think or act in a certain way. Your approach to storytelling will be significantly influenced by your understanding of your audience.

#### Determining Your Intent
As an author, you may be driven by various intentions. You might be looking to record personal thoughts or feelings that are transient yet want them to be vividly remembered later. This could be a personal endeavor or something meant for a wider audience.

#### Scope of the Audience
The audience for whom you're writing can vary greatly. You might be writing for yourself, exploring personal thoughts and feelings, or trying to communicate with a broader audience which could range from a single individual, a small group, to all of humanity. As the size of your audience increases, the universality and the generality of the symbols or language you use increase, while the specificity decreases. It's essential to understand your target audience to choose the appropriate form and medium of communication, possibly shaping your narrative into a compelling story.

#### The Role of Dramatica in Communication
The Dramatica theory, being a representation of the mind, has extensive applications in various domains including communication theory. Although exploring all these avenues is beyond the scope of the current implementation of Dramatica, it can potentially serve as a tool for exploring various perspectives in the author-audience relationship. It can be used as a template to translate the grand argument story perspective into useful tools for different forms of communication, extending the utility of the software beyond its primary purpose.

---

This clarification and summary condenses the main ideas presented in the passage and presents them in a structured and simplified manner. It highlights the significant considerations in storytelling according to the Dramatica Theory, emphasizing the role of understanding the audience and the intentions of the author in crafting a compelling narrative.

### Writing for Groups
The text explores the notion of group formation and the inherent connections within an audience, emphasizing the importance of shared interests, experiences, and human cognitive processes in group bonding. Here is a summarized and clarified version of the text:

### What Defines a Group?

#### Group Formation through Shared Interests
Groups are more than mere assemblies of people; they are united by certain commonalities, be it interests, ideologies, professions, or circumstances. These connections can even be as simple as coming together to form an audience. For instance, readers of novels or viewers of a TV series may not physically gather but become a group through shared interests and experiences, forming a sub-culture within the larger society. This demonstrates how works of fiction can not only attract but also create groups.

#### Fundamental Bonds in Human Groups
Even when an audience comes together without a clear expectation, as in the case of a captive audience in classrooms or theatres, there is a fundamental layer of connection. Despite diverse thoughts and ideas, all humans share the same basic cognitive processes that unify us at a fundamental level, making us all a part of the human group. 

#### The Art of Effective Storytelling
For effective communication, it is crucial to differentiate between forming the content of a story (storyforming) and the method of conveying it (storytelling). Successful storytelling hinges on the appropriate use of symbols that are understood, both explicitly and implicitly, by the intended audience. Simply identifying with your audience is inadequate; it is vital to accurately recognize who your audience is to prevent miscommunication and to ensure that your message isn't distorted or lost. Assuming that identification with a group will automatically lead to clear communication can be a fallacy, and it might not guarantee the message's effective reception by all members of the audience.

---

This summary highlights the complexities of group dynamics and the underlying connections that bind individuals in a group. It also emphasizes the intricate art of storytelling, where a deep understanding and identification of the audience are critical in conveying a message effectively without loss or distortion.

### A Quick Lesson in Propaganda
#### Utilizing Propaganda in Storytelling: A Guide

In this passage, propaganda is discussed as a powerful tool in storytelling, with potential to influence audiences in profound ways, both positively and negatively. Here, the emphasis is on how to craft and utilize propaganda in stories, and not on its moral implications.

##### Definition of Propaganda

In the Dramatica theory, propaganda is seen as a technique employed in storytelling to impact the audience, encouraging them to think or act in particular ways even after engaging with the story. Its effectiveness depends largely on the skill of the author and the receptiveness of the audience. It doesn't inherently contain morality; the moral implications depend on how it's used by the author and interpreted by the audience.

##### Basics and Execution

The essence of propaganda is manipulating the story structure to influence the audience's viewpoints. This can be achieved by deliberately omitting certain parts of the story, forcing the audience to fill in the gaps with their own perceptions and experiences, which could potentially align with the author's perspective, making the audience more likely to adopt that viewpoint.

There are two kinds of stories in this context:

1. **Closed Stories**: These present a complete argument where the audience can either accept or reject the author's viewpoint.
2. **Open Stories**: These are incomplete narratives that require the audience to supply missing pieces to derive meaning from the story. If done skillfully, this can transform the audience into collaborators in propagating the author's viewpoint, thus creating propaganda.

##### Crafting a Propaganda Story

When creating a propaganda story, an author needs to consider several factors:

1. **Nature of Impact**: Determine the kind of influence you want on your audience, focusing on either their motivations, methodologies, purposes, or means of evaluation.
2. **Area of Impact**: Decide which part of the audience's worldview you want to affect. This could be their view of the external world, relationships, themselves, or others.
3. **Type of Impact (Specific vs. General)**:
   - Specific Impact: This kind focuses on altering or promoting particular behaviors or thoughts, but it's easier for the audience to identify and potentially resist.
   - General Impact: This has a broader influence, altering the audience's overall perception of their world. It is more pervasive but less discernible.
4. **Degree of Impact**: This considers the extent to which you want to influence your audience, dependent on various factors including the author's skill and the nature of the audience.

##### Audience and Symbolism

Understanding your audience is vital for effective propaganda. The symbols used in encoding the story play a crucial role as well:

- Specific symbols can have a greater impact but on a limited audience.
- Less specific symbols can influence a wider audience but with lesser impact.
- Familiarity with the symbols used makes an audience more susceptible to propaganda.

Overall, utilizing propaganda in storytelling is a nuanced process requiring a deep understanding of story structures and audience psychology. It's a tool that can be wielded for various effects, demanding responsibility and skill from the author.

#### Types of Propaganda Techniques in Storytelling

In storytelling, authors can employ various propaganda techniques to impact their audience in specific ways. These techniques aim to shape the audience's thoughts, behaviors, and perceptions. Here are four distinct types of propaganda techniques used in storytelling:

#### 1. **Shock as Propaganda**

**Definition:** This technique involves controlling what the audience knows about the story before experiencing it and then purposefully breaking the storyform during the narrative to shock or jar the audience.

**Impact Level:** It affects the audience at an Impulsive Responses (Preconscious) level, triggering instantaneous, knee-jerk reactions.

**Specificity:** Shock propaganda is highly specific and immediately jarring.

**Examples:** Films like "Psycho" and "The Crying Game" effectively employed shock propaganda. "Psycho" shocked its audience by killing off the main character early in the film, while "The Crying Game" surprised the audience with a major revelation about one of the characters.

#### 2. **Awareness as Propaganda**

**Definition:** This technique involves being upfront with the audience about the nature of the propaganda, allowing them to actively consider different perspectives or arguments.

**Impact Level:** It influences the audience at a Contemplation (Conscious) level, requiring them to weigh the pros and cons of the issues presented.

**Specificity:** Awareness propaganda focuses on controlling the givens related to the issues discussed in the story.

**Example:** The film "JFK" used awareness propaganda by addressing the controversial topic of President Kennedy's assassination and presenting a specific conspiracy theory. This led the audience to consider and debate the various parties involved in the conspiracy.

#### 3. **Conditioning as Propaganda**

**Definition:** This technique involves presenting an alternative life experience to the audience, often ignoring or catering to cultural biases. The audience fills in contextual meaning based on their own experiences.

**Impact Level:** It targets the audience's Memories, influencing their beliefs and perspectives over time.

**Specificity:** Conditioning propaganda lacks context, which is supplied by the audience's personal experiences.

**Example:** "Crimes and Misdemeanors" is a film that employed conditioning propaganda by presenting two separate stories—one with a morally reprehensible character who succeeds and another with a well-meaning character who fails. This challenged the audience's biases and opened up new possibilities for problem-solving.

#### 4. **Misdirection as Propaganda**

**Definition:** This subtle technique involves directing the audience's conscious attention in one direction while making the real impact in their subconscious. It relies on omitting parts of the storyform to create blind spots for the audience.

**Impact Level:** It targets the audience's Subconscious, where they are less aware of the manipulation.

**Specificity:** Misdirection propaganda diverts the audience's attention from omitted storyform elements, focusing it on others.

**Example:** Authors can use dynamic pairs of partners in the storyform to achieve misdirection propaganda. For instance, omitting a motivation element allows the audience to focus on purpose, thereby manipulating their understanding of character motivations.

**Warning:** While propaganda can be a potent storytelling tool, it carries risks. Audiences may react negatively if they perceive manipulation. Additionally, real-world events and changing attitudes can influence the effectiveness of propaganda over time. Authors should use propaganda techniques carefully and be aware of potential backlash.
### A Word About Adaptation
#### Understanding Adaptation in Storytelling

Adapting a story from one medium to another is a complex process that involves various considerations to maintain the story's integrity while catering to a new audience. This article explores the challenges and strategies for successful adaptation.

**Defining Adaptation:** Adaptation is the process of translating a story from one medium (e.g., book, play, or stage) to another (e.g., film or musical). It involves reimagining the story's presentation to suit the characteristics of the new medium.

**Elements of Adaptation:**
- **Medium:** Each medium has its unique strengths and limitations, impacting how a story is presented. Adapters must understand these differences.
  
- **Story:** A story encompasses all the information an author wishes to communicate, including themes, experiences, and emotions. Adapting a story involves translating this information from one medium to another.

**Balancing Identity and Integrity:** Adaptation poses a dilemma: should the adapter strive to accurately recreate the story's structure (identity) or faithfully reproduce its emotional impact (integrity)? This balance between preserving parts and staying true to the whole is at the heart of the adapter's challenge.

**Media-Specific Strengths and Weaknesses:** Every medium has distinct capabilities and limitations. For example, books may struggle to convey sounds and visual atmospheres, while films may find it challenging to depict characters' inner thoughts. Adapters must recognize these differences to make informed choices.

**Essential vs. Non-Essential Elements:** Some aspects of a story are considered essential by the audience. Adapters must ensure that these core elements are retained or recreated. Other elements can be more flexible, allowing for adjustments to fit the new medium.

**Analyzing the Original Work:** Successful adaptation begins with a thorough analysis of the original work. It's not enough to know the story from the inside out; adapters must also understand how the audience perceives it.

**The Four Stages of Communication:** Adapters can analyze the story in terms of the Four Stages of Communication:
- **Storyforming:** Defining the story's message for both the author and the audience.
  
- **Storyencoding:** Selecting symbols and representations to convey the message.
  
- **Storyweaving:** Unfolding the story's symbols in a way that creates suspense, tension, or surprise.
  
- **Story Reception:** Understanding the audience's prior knowledge and expectations.

**Maintaining Storyform and Storyencoding:** Storyform represents the essential dramatic structure of the story, while Storyencoding involves the symbols used to convey it. Adapters must strive to retain or recreate the original storyform and adjust Storyencoding as needed.

**Storyweaving Personality:** The way a story unfolds, its pacing, and the manner in which secrets are revealed contribute to its personality. Adapters must maintain the story's personality, as it plays a crucial role in the audience's experience.

**Adapting for the Audience:** Adapters must identify their target audience and consider their expectations, prior knowledge, and biases. Balancing adaptation for diehard fans and appealing to a broader audience requires careful consideration.

In summary, adaptation is a nuanced process that demands a deep understanding of both the original work and the new medium. Successful adapters must maintain a delicate balance between identity and integrity, adapting elements while preserving the essence of the story.
