# Introduction 

**Narratology: Defining and Understanding Narratives**

- **Working Definitions**:
  - Purpose: To empower narrative students with foundational understandings to test against their studies.
  - Core: Definitions do not hold absolute truths but act as tools for discussion and understanding.

- **Narratology**:
  - Definition: The ensemble of theories about narratives encompassing various cultural artefacts that tell a story.
  - Role: Helps in understanding, analyzing, and evaluating narratives.

- **Theory**: 
  - Definition: A systematic set of statements about a segment of reality.
  - Application: For narratology, the segment is narrative texts from varied backgrounds with multiple functions.

- **Characteristics of Narrative Texts**:
  - Purpose: Understanding these characteristics assists in understanding the construction of each narrative.
  - Result: Allows for a description of a narrative system, and the variations possible within that system.

- **Narrative System**:
  - Definition: The description and understanding of how narratives are constructed.
  - Role: Using finite concepts from the system, an infinite number of narrative texts can be described.

- **Use of Theory**:
  - Not a Machine: Theory isn't a straightforward input-output mechanism; interpretation remains essential.
  - Tool for Interpretation: Concepts presented are intellectual tools that help articulate understanding and facilitate discussions.

- **Textual Descriptions**:
  - Subjectivity: Reading is inherently subjective, leading to varied descriptions even when using the same theoretical tools.
  - Democratic Theory Use: Systematic theories enable a "democratic" sharing and discussion of interpretations, promoting intersubjectivity.

- **Corpus of Narrative Texts**:
  - Initial Thought: Novels, novellas, short stories, fairy tales, newspaper articles, etc.
  - Boundaries: Debate exists on what should be included, like comic strips.
  - Importance of Definitions: Agreeing on definitions, like what constitutes a "text," can resolve disagreements.

- **Challenges of Definitions**:
  - Variability: Common terms like literature, narrative, and text can have varied meanings to different people.
  - Provisional Nature: Definitions proposed are temporary and serve primarily to ensure clarity in discussions.

**Key Idea**: Narratology provides a structured approach to understanding narratives, relying on systematic theories and definitions to interpret and discuss a diverse range of narrative texts.

**Narratology: Understanding Texts, Stories, and Fabulas**

- **Text Definition**:
  - Core Idea: A finite, structured ensemble of signs.
  - Variety: Signs can range from linguistic units (words, sentences) to other mediums like cinematic sequences, painted elements, etc.
  - Boundaries: Although a text has definitive starting and ending signs, its meanings and interpretations can be infinite.

- **Narrative Text**:
  - Definition: A medium (language, imagery, sound, etc.) where a story is conveyed by an agent to an addressee.
  - Distinction: Not synonymous with the story it portrays.

- **Story vs. Fabula**:
  - **Story**:
    - Definition: The content of a narrative text giving a unique manifestation to a fabula.
  - **Fabula**:
    - Definition: A sequence of logically and chronologically connected events involving actors.
    - Elements: Incorporates "events" (transitions from one state to another) and "actors" (agents performing actions).

- **Theory in Practice - "Tom Thumb" Example**:
  - Different Texts, Same Story: The fairy tale can be narrated in multiple versions, each being a unique text but presenting a similar story.
  - Text Diversity: Some versions might be literary, others suitable for children, or some might be too frightening.
  - **Story vs. Fabula Distinction**:
    - Perspective: Readers may perceive events differently based on their presentation in the story compared to the events' sequence in the fabula's world.
    - Emotion Elicitation: Despite the cruel nature of the fabula, the story presentation makes readers sympathize with certain characters over others.
  - Transcending Mediums: The story's impact isn't solely language-based; reactions can be consistent across different mediums, like cartoons.

- **Three-layer Analysis**:
  - Layers: Text, Story, and Fabula.
  - Analytical Approach: These layers can be analyzed separately, though they are interconnected.
  - Material Existence: Only the text, manifested in specific sign systems, is materially accessible.
  - Basis: This three-layered distinction is theoretical, rooted in reasoned suppositions.

**Key Idea**: Narratology offers a three-layered perspective - text, story, and fabula - where each layer brings unique depth to the understanding and interpretation of narratives.

**Narratology: Layers, Fabula Elements, and Narration**

- **Significance of Layers**:
  - Core Idea: Layers are provisional tools crucial for a detailed text analysis.
  - Reading vs. Analyzing: While interconnected, they are distinct activities; reading encompasses interpretative moments that later influence analysis.
  
- **Understanding the Fabula**:
  - Definition: Material or content shaped into a story; a series of events with inherent logic.
  - Key Elements of a Fabula:
    - **Events**: Sequential actions that adhere to the logic of events.
    - **Actors**: Agents of action with specific functions and relations to events.
    - **Time**: All events consume time, crucial for continuity and outcomes in a fabula.
    - **Location**: Every event happens somewhere, whether real (e.g., Amsterdam) or imaginary (e.g., Narnia).
    
- **Processes Involved in Structuring a Story**:
  - **Sequence Arrangement**: Events might differ from their chronological order.
  - **Time Allotment**: The story designates time to fabula elements based on their significance.
  - **Character Formation**: Actors gain distinct traits, individualizing them.
  - **Location Specificity**: Places where events occur are defined uniquely.
  - **Inter-element Relationships**: Symbolic, allusive, and traditional relationships among elements.
  - **Point of View Selection**: Determines the focalization, lending subjectivity to the story.
  
- **From Fabula to Narrative Text**:
  - **Story Distinction**: Each story, though sourced from a fabula, has unique traits or aspects.
  - **Narrative Text Definition**: A conveyed story requiring a medium and conversion into signs.
  - **Narration**:
    - **Agent**: Not to be confused with the actual author; often a fictitious narrator.
    - **Narration Dynamics**: The narrator can intermittently relinquish the narration to actors, especially during direct speech.

**Key Idea**: In narratology, layers serve as tools for textual analysis, the fabula encompasses key foundational elements, and narrative texts evolve from stories through specific narrational techniques and mediums.
# 1 Text: Signs



## 1: Preliminary Remarks 

**Narrative Agents and the Dichotomy of Authorship**

- **Definition of a Narrative Text**:
  - Core Idea: A medium wherein a narrative agent communicates a story.
  - **Narrative Agent Distinction**: 
    - Defined as a subject (either linguistic, visual, or cinematic) that expresses through the medium, but not to be confused with the real-life author.
    - Example: The narrator of "Emma" is distinct from Jane Austen, the author.

- **Narrative Agent vs. Biographical Author**:
  - **Separation Principle**: The real-life circumstances of the author are not relevant to narratology, the study of narratives.
    - E.g., Jane Austen's personal history is not of consequence in the analysis of her narrative style in "Emma".
  - **Terminology Clarification**: The narrative agent will occasionally be referred to as "it" to avoid confusion with the real-life author.

- **Interpretation Power Struggle**:
  - **Author's Authority**: Relying on the author to validate interpretations can be a misstep, as it ties the idea of "author" with "authority."
  - **Reader's Role**:
    - Undoubtedly vital in an interactive understanding of a narrative.
    - But their interpretation power is not absolute; influenced by cultural and social norms.
    - The perspective that every reader uniquely interprets a narrative is not fully accurate.

**Key Idea**: In narratology, it's crucial to distinguish between the narrative agent and the real-life author. While both have roles in the interpretation of a narrative, neither holds an absolute power over its understanding.

## 2: The Narrator

**Understanding Narration and Its Complex Layers**

- **Narrator’s Identity & Role**:
  - **Narration's Character**: The identity of the narrator and how it's presented in a text gives the story its unique character.
  - **Focalization**: 
    - Definition: Represented coloring of the story by a perceiving agent, establishing the viewpoint.
    - Connection: Narrator and focalization together define the narrative situation.
  - **Perception's Role**: Perception, both in seeing and interpreting, is the essence of narration.

- **Distinction in Narration Forms**:
  - **Narrator's "Voice"**:
    - Traditionally categorized as “first-person” or “third-person,” with occasional "second-person" experiments.
    - Note: "Third-person narrator" is misleading; a narrator is not a "he" or "she."
  - **Examples**:
    - First-person: "(I say:) I will be twenty-one tomorrow."
    - Third-person: "(I say:) Elizabeth will be twenty-one tomorrow."
  - **External vs. Character-Bound Narrator**:
    - **External Narrator**: Does not reference itself as a character.
      - Focuses on other characters or events.
    - **Character-Bound Narrator**: Identified with a character within the story.
      - Often implies a recounting of true events about themselves, even if implausible.

- **Narrative Rhetoric of Truth**:
  - **Character-Bound Narrative**:
    - Often suggests an autobiographical tone.
    - Example: Cortázar’s “Axolotl” – a first-person narrative of transformation into a lizard, exploring human identity.
  - **External Narrative**: 
    - Presents stories about others as factual.
    - Example: "(I narrate: (I testify:)) Elizabeth felt a great anxiety that day."

**Key Idea**: Narration intricately layers the identities of narrators, their voice, and the focalization of the story, emphasizing the importance of perception and the rhetoric of truth in storytelling.

**Summary: The Narrator and Forms of Narration**

- **Narrator's Identity & Character**:
  - The identity of the narrator significantly impacts the character of the text.
  - This identity is often tied to the concept of focalization, which together determines the narrative situation.
  - Focalization is the perceived coloring of a story by an agent of perception or point of view holder.
  
- **Narration and Focalization**:
  - Narration inherently implies focalization.
  - There's a need to differentiate between textual agents (like linguistic or visual) and the object of their activity, which may be produced by a different agent.
  - Language is believed to shape vision and worldview.
  - Perception and interpretation are central to narration.
  
- **Forms of Narration**:
  - Traditionally narratives have been categorized based on the "voice" of the narrator as "first-person" or "third-person", with few exceptions in "second-person".
  - However, regardless of the grammatical point of view, a narrator is always the "first person". 
  - The distinction between "first-person" and "third-person" narratives lies in who the narrative is about - self or someone else.
  - Narrators can be external (telling about others) or character-bound (telling about themselves). The latter often claims to be recounting true facts.
  
- **Narrative Rhetoric & Truth**:
  - Narrators, especially character-bound ones, often imply the truthfulness of their account.
  - Indications such as "Once upon a time..." suggest fictionality.
  - External narrators can also present stories about others as true, though the distinction between factual and fictional is crucial.
  
- **Child Narrators and Authenticity**:
  - A child narrator can bring an authentic and raw perspective to a story.
  - The same story can vary in perception and presentation depending on the age and knowledge of the narrator, as showcased in the given examples.
  - Language and the relationship with it can be a central theme, especially when there's a shift from native to foreign understanding, leading to a split in the subject's identity.

**Key Idea**: The identity and perspective of the narrator, combined with the forms of narration, play a pivotal role in shaping the character and authenticity of a narrative, influencing how stories are perceived and interpreted.

**Narrative Techniques and the Construction of Identity in Literature**

- **Toni Morrison's Fragmentation:**
  - Description: Morrison's "Beloved" presents a narration highlighting fusion with the mother and self-fragmentation.
  - Context: Symbolizes the early infant's unformed ego, linking to the tragic history of slavery.
  - Symbolism: The struggle to remember trauma is represented metaphorically by the challenge of "re-membering" one's face or body.
  
- **Louis Couperus's Characterization and Themes:**
  - Author Background: Couperus, a Dutch author, grew up in a colonial administrators' family, witnessed severe parental expectations, and lived in the Indies.
  - Primary Themes: The inevitability of fate in human life, depicted as a force filled with guilt. His works often contrast the north (cold, somber, male) with the south (sensual, female).
  - Example Novel: "Of Old People" - A Dutch variant of Naturalism highlighting hereditary flaws across generations and the looming reveal of a past crime.

- **Diverse Narrative “I” Constructs:**
  - *Steyn's Voice Passages*:
    - Passage d: An external narrator describes a scene where Steyn's voice irritates his wife, Ottilie.
    - Passage e: A character-narrator, presumably Ottilie, recounts her own experience hearing Steyn's voice.
    - Passage f: A detached narrator gives insight into the relationship dynamics between Steyn and Ottilie.
    - Passage g: The narrative suggests Steyn's suspected infidelity and Ottilie's irritation every time he goes out.
  - Analysis: Each passage offers varied relationships between the narrative "I" and the story's content. They exemplify different blends of narrators, focalizers, and actors.

**Key Idea:** Narration techniques, whether through fragmented experiences or character-focused storytelling, profoundly shape the reader's perception and understanding of identity and events in literature.

**Understanding Narration and Focalization in Literature**

- **Double Focalization**
  - The text introduces the concept of double focalization which involves two perspectives: an external one (possibly from the narrative agent) and a character's perspective. This dual perspective is symbolized as EF [CF (Ott.)]-Steyn.
  - An example given demonstrates that while Steyn's voice is heard, the reaction (startling) is observed from Ottilie's perspective, suggesting both focalizations at play.

- **Narrative Identity & Historical Context**
  - Narration in literature involves different agents with distinct identities. The text references older literature, such as works by Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Balzac, Dickens, and Cervantes's Don Quixote, as examples where such narrative techniques are prominent.
  - These authors often utilize narrative claims of truth as a fictionality device, evident in direct claims of truth or contradiction of the same.

- **Role of the Narrator as a Witness**
  - A witness in narrative serves multiple roles, from conveying emotions like compassion or irony to influencing the story's veracity. The presence of a witness in a story might not always be overt, but their influence is crucial.
  - The narrator, when acting as a witness, might remain invisible yet plays a vital role in the narrative, influencing the reader's emotional connection and ethical considerations.

- **Variability of Focalization**
  - Focalization can shift between characters and agents. For instance, in Alain Robbe-Grillet’s La jalousie, despite a consistent narration technique, many critics view the narrator as a specific character due to the influence of the title.
  - In another example, the narrative voice, Steyn's voice in this case, suggests that the narrator acts as a witness to the events described, raising questions about the source of the information.

- **Different Narrative Situations**
  - The text provides several examples, showcasing distinct narrative situations, highlighting the versatility of narration in literature.
  - Whether the narrator stands inside or outside the story, whether the focalization is embedded, and whether the narrative "I" speaks about itself or others, all contribute to the narrative's depth and complexity.

- **Traditional Narration Distinctions**
  - The distinction between "I"-narratives and "he"-narratives is deemed inadequate. Factors such as the narrator's involvement in the story and its relationship to the object of narration need consideration.
  - Narration can remain constant or evolve throughout a text. A once imperceptible narrator might later reference itself, subtly shifting the narrative experience and introducing the presence of a witness.

**Key Idea:** 
Narration and focalization in literature are intricate tools that authors employ to convey depth, perspective, and emotion, with varied narrative identities and roles influencing the reader's experience and connection to the story.

**Analysis of Second-Person Narration**

- **The Illusion of "Second Person" in "La modification"**
  - Michel Butor's novel uses the second person consistently, which initially interrupts the traditional narrative flow.
  - Eventually, the narrative prevails, with readers reverting to first-person interpretation, making the protagonist's journey more relatable.
  - The “you” used in the novel cannot align with the reader or be perceived as an addressee in lyrical poetry; it's an “I” in disguise. It gives an impression of an interior monologue.
  
- **Essence of Language and Deixis**
  - Butor failed to embrace the essence of the second person, which lies in the core of communication.
  - Linguist Émile Benveniste emphasizes the significance of deixis (contextual words like “I,” “you,” “here”).
    - Language's essence isn't just about the world but about the formation of subjectivity essential for communication.
    - Pronouns like “I” and “you” are contextually empty and don't reference outside the situation they're used in. 
    - The second person (you) validates the “I” as a speaker, while also having the potential to become an “I” in a different perspective.
  
- **Flaw in "La modification"**
  - The novel lacks the feature of deixis: the interchangeability of the first and second person.
  - Characters other than “you” are always referred to in the third person, creating a separation rather than mutual subjectivity confirmation.
  - This leads to the pronoun “you” symbolizing alienation instead of subjectivity fulfilment. The reader never identifies with the “you” or becomes its counterpart, the “I.”

- **Inherent Challenge of Second-Person Narrators**
  - Based on Butor’s use, second-person narrators seem not only logically problematic but also unmanageable for readers.
  - The actual “second person” in narrative storytelling is the reader themselves.

**Key Idea**: The intricacies of second-person narration, as explored through Butor's "La modification," reveal the challenges in accurately capturing the essence of deixis, emphasizing the importance of mutual subjectivity in communication.
## 3: Non-Narrative Comments

**Analysis of Non-Narrative Comments in Texts**

- **Definition and Importance**
  - Non-narrative comments are segments within a narrative text that don't necessarily drive the narrative forward.
  - These comments can be critical as they often contain ideological statements.
  - Analyzing these segments helps to understand a text's overt and more subtle ideologies.
  
- **Example: "Danny Goes Shopping" by L. Roggeveen**
  - Main Story: Danny observes the arrival of a bridal pair.
  - Non-narrative Sections:
    - Lines 9-15 convey the love between Mr. Alexander and Miss Ann without presenting new events.
    - Lines 13-15 offer opinions on societal norms regarding love and marriage, suggesting it's universal and expected behavior.
    - The mock dialogue form, exclamation marks, and terms like "of course" aim to present the opinion as self-evident and universally accepted.
  
- **Characteristics of Non-Narrative Comments**
  - They can be descriptive, mentioning elements from the fabula, or argumentative, discussing general knowledge outside of the fabula.
  - The form of representation, like the catechistic style in the example, carries its ideological implications.
  - It's important to note that both narrative and non-narrative sections can convey ideology, but in different ways.
  
- **Interplay of Different Textual Forms**
  - While non-narrative sections can explicitly present an ideology, other parts of the text might contradict or treat them ironically.
  - To fully grasp a text's ideological stance, one should analyze the relationship between its narrative and non-narrative elements.
  
- **Ubiquity of Non-Narrative Comments**
  - They appear throughout narratives, providing depth, context, or color to the main story.
  - Non-narrative texts, like scientific writings, can also contain narrative elements.

**Key Idea:** Non-narrative comments, though not central to the main plot, play a vital role in shaping the ideological undertones and context of a narrative, bridging the gap between straightforward storytelling and broader societal or cultural insights.

## 4: Description

**Description in Narrative Texts**

- **Role and Impact of Description**
  - Description acts as a pivotal focalization point, influencing a text's ideological and aesthetic resonance.
  - Essential for narrative as it makes the fabula's world vivid, facilitating shared imagination.
  - Logically necessary to contextualize fabula elements, so their roles are coherent.
  
- **Defining Description**
  - The essence lies in the attribution of features to objects.
  - For instance, an excerpt from "The Golden Bowl" by Henry James predominantly describes Bob Assingham's physical traits.
  - Description can sometimes blend with narration, like in "Dombey and Son" by Charles Dickens, where the environment is depicted alongside a progression of time and events.
  
- **Historical Treatment of Description**
  - Within the realistic tradition, descriptions have been contentious.
    - Plato, in the "Republic," sought to make Homer's text purely narrative, eliminating descriptions.
    - Homer tried to incorporate description within a narrative frame, such as describing Achilles's shield as it was being crafted.
  - The 19th-century realistic novel often justified descriptions with narrative motivation.
  - The "nouveau roman" genre, despite its avoidance of representation, still integrates description in its tradition.

**Key Idea:** Description, while sometimes seen as secondary to narrative, is both practically and logically vital, acting as a medium to vividly convey the imagined world and context of the fabula, and has been treated with varying degrees of integration across literary traditions.

**Motivation in Descriptive Narratives**

- **Rhetorical Strategy and Realism**
  - Descriptions, traditionally seen as interrupting the fabula, define a narrator's rhetorical strategy.
  - In realistic narratives, descriptions demand motivation.
    - Zola's perspective of objectivity in novels means making descriptions appear natural and self-evident.
    - Such "objectivity" often veils subjectivity, especially when narratives hinge on reader-character psychological identification.
  
- **Aspects and Types of Motivation**
  - Realist narrative emphasizes motivation to ensure content is plausible.
  - Three distinct motivations:
    - **Speaking:** Narration requiring a listener who lacks knowledge.
    - **Looking:** Dominant form where description reproduces a character's vision. For example, the passage from Jean Rhys's "Outside the Machine" justifies the act of looking based on the characters' setting and situation.
    - **Acting:** Direct interaction with an object, turning description narrative-like, as seen in Zola’s "La bête humaine" or Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude."
  
- **Challenges and Limitations of Motivation**
  - Fiction's inherent arbitrariness means an endless need for motivation.
  - Authors like Sarraute and Robbe-Grillet from the French nouveau roman criticize realistic fiction's endless quest for motivation.
  - The fundamental arbitrariness of fictional content makes total motivation elusive and, to an extent, arbitrary itself.

**Key Idea:** In realistic narratives, motivation – whether through speaking, looking, or acting – is essential to make descriptions plausible and integrate them seamlessly into the story, although achieving total motivation remains a challenge due to fiction's inherent arbitrariness.

**Rhetorical Structures in Descriptions**

- **Fundamental Mechanics of Description**
  - Descriptions use rhetoric to present arbitrary elements as natural or inevitable.
  - Components of a description:
    - **Theme:** The main object being described.
    - **Sub-themes:** Components or elements of the main object.
    - **Predicates:** Qualities or characteristics of the theme or sub-themes, which can be qualifying or functional.
    - Relations between theme and sub-theme are often synecdochic or metonymical, while relations between a theme or sub-theme and predicates can be metaphorical.

- **Six Types of Descriptive Structures**
  - **1. Referential, Encyclopaedic Description**
    - No figurative language; offers pure knowledge.
    - Components are selected based on their contiguity.
    - Encyclopaedia is the model for this type.
  
  - **2. Referential-Rhetorical Description**
    - Combines knowledge conveyance with persuasion.
    - Uses wording and content choices for persuasion.
    - Modelled on tourist guidebooks.

  - **3. Metaphoric Metonymy**
    - Constructs using contiguity but individual components are metaphorical.
    - Implicit components lead readers to fill in the gaps.

  - **4. Systematized Metaphor**
    - The entire description acts as a comprehensive metaphor.
    - Elements are systematically related, built upon contiguity.
    - Context defines the dominating series in the metaphor.

  - **5. Metonymic Metaphor**
    - One extensive metaphor with elements in a contiguous relationship.
    - When taken out of context, it resembles other types.
    - Explicit comparisons can lead to Homeric comparisons.

  - **6. Series of Metaphors**
    - A succession of adjusted metaphors without constant reference to the compared element.
    - Creates an impression of an elusive, indescribable compared element.

- **Implications and Applications**
  - These rhetorical categories help to differentiate and analyze narratives across various historical periods or styles.

**Key Idea:** Descriptions use varied rhetorical structures to convey information, with six main types identified based on the relationships and tropes within them, providing tools for narrative analysis across historical and stylistic contexts.

**Analysis of “Descriptology” in Djuna Barnes’s Nightwood**

- **General Overview**:
  - The excerpt discusses the art of description as illustrated by a fragment from Djuna Barnes's modernist novel, Nightwood (1937).
  - The description being analyzed portrays a scene where Felix Volkbein observes Robin Vote, setting the stage for the narrative of Nightwood.

- **Narrative Techniques**:
  - **Introductory Frame**: 
    - The narrative commences with setting the scene, placing readers in a hotel setting.
    - Provides an external viewpoint of Robin Vote, focusing on her surroundings and appearance.
  - **Use of Metaphors & References**: 
    - Barnes incorporates various metaphors and allusions, painting Robin as an enigmatic, multi-faceted entity – referencing the sea, forest, mushrooms, and more.
    - The depiction of Robin as a "born somnambule" hints at her elusive nature, inaccessible to any observer or suitor.
  - **Decentring Techniques**: 
    - The narrative meanders, venturing into descriptions that serve to distract from the central scene. This, in turn, adds depth and complexity.
    - Barnes uses the ekphrasis technique, describing a non-existent painting, thereby expanding the imagery.

- **Focalization**:
  - **Perception Link**:
    - The story adopts Felix Volkbein's perspective, underlining the subjective nature of the description. His ascent contrasts with his downward gaze upon Robin.
  - **Descriptive Elements**: 
    - Barnes presents Robin as a spectacle, emphasizing her allure through vivid details, from her posture on the bed to her attire.
    - The environment around Robin, such as the exotic plants and faint birdsong, further romanticizes the setting.

- **Symbolism and Motifs**:
  - **Nineteenth-Century Artist's Studio Setting**: 
    - The described ambiance, including potted plants and cut flowers, alludes to a late 19th-century artist's workshop setting, enhancing the scene's aesthetic.
  - **Sensory Descriptions**: 
    - Barnes involves multiple senses, from the visual representation of Robin and her surroundings to auditory elements like the birds' song and olfactory cues describing Robin's unique scent.

- **Anticipation and Suspense**:
  - The elaborate details preceding Robin's description heighten suspense and accentuate her eventual portrayal.
  - The scene foreshadows an impending relationship between Felix and Robin, hinting at its doomed nature.

**Key Idea**: 
The analysis underscores the intricacies of narrative description, demonstrating how Djuna Barnes masterfully employs focalization, metaphor, and other literary techniques to craft an evocative, layered portrayal of a scene in "Nightwood".
## 5: Levels of Narration 
**Levels of Narration in Couperus's "Of Old People"**

- **Emotive Language Use**
  - The phrase “Oh, that voice of Steyn’s!” remains unchanged in fragments d to g, displaying emotive language.
  - The use of the word “Oh” and the exclamation mark indicate strong emotion.
  - The lack of a verb in the sentence enhances its emotional effect.
  
- **Narrative Structure**
  - Declarative verbs signal a change in narrative level.
  - When the external narrator "yields the floor," it is often to a character like Ottilie.
  - This is termed a "second-level character-bound narrator" (CN2), where a character is quoted by the first-level narrator.
  
- **Embedded Sentences**
  - Embedded sentences, like "Oh, that voice of Steyn’s, I hissed between my teeth," indicate shifts between narrative levels.
  - These shifts help distinguish between events that happened "then" versus the narrative "now."
  - Direct discourse represents a linguistic event, while the conveyed emotion, in principle, is the event itself.
  
- **Perceptible External Narrator**
  - The external narrator becomes more evident when they show emotion or reactions, suggesting their presence in the narrative.
  - This leads to the possibility of the narrator transitioning to an actor within the narrative.
  
- **Thoughts vs. Spoken Words**
  - Not all "quoted" words are spoken; some might just be thoughts.
  - This distinction is crucial as it can imply fictionality, and dictate the balance of power between characters.
  - If a character's internal thoughts, especially judgments about others, are revealed without being spoken to the character in question, it establishes an inequality in narrative power dynamics.
  
- **Example from "The Cat" by Colette**
  - The man's thoughts about his wife are regularly presented to the reader without the wife's knowledge.
  - This creates a power imbalance as she remains oblivious to his feelings.

**Key Idea:** The narrative structure and levels of narration play a pivotal role in shaping the reader's understanding and perception of characters, relationships, and events, leading to varied interpretations and emotional engagements with the story.

**Levels of Narration in Literary History**

- **Historical Characterization of Narratives:**
  - Levels of narration can characterize narratives historically in terms of literary currents.
  - Avoiding facile categorizations is vital; the structure can provide nuances to these characterizations.
  
- **Examples from French Literature:**
  - *Flaubert’s Madame Bovary*: Begins with an internal narrator. Quoted speeches are second-level narrations.
    - The first-person narrator disappears quickly, seeming to shift to an external narrator.
    - The initial "we" (nous) suggests that the narrator was present, acting as a witness.
    - The narrative pulls the first person from the past into the present, emphasizing Flaubert's realism.
    - It suggests the novel's events are a "real-life" account of life in the countryside.
  - *Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu*: The first sentence introduces a repeated action.
    - It sets a tone for a deep reflection on sleep, bridging conscious and unconscious existence.
    - This positions the narrator as deeply subjective, emphasizing Proust's modernist poetics.
    
- **Realism vs. Modernism:**
  - Flaubert's realism is about the "here-and-now". The objective nature of realistic fiction is not guaranteed.
  - Proust's modernist approach emphasizes the subjectivity, representing a different era of poetics.
  
- **Inflection and Nuance in Established Literary Movements:**
  - Neither Flaubert nor Proust strictly fit their respective literary periods.
    - Flaubert refines realism by implicating the reader and setting a contemporary provincial backdrop.
    - Proust explores subjectivity and the challenges it presents to narration.
  - Both authors utilize embedded speeches to explore the boundaries of their contemporary poetics.

**Key Idea:** Levels of narration can be instrumental in understanding and characterizing literary works in light of their historical contexts, with Flaubert and Proust showcasing how these narrative structures can inflect and nuance established literary movements.

**Postmodern Narration in J.M. Coetzee’s "Foe"**

- **Coetzee's Reworking of Defoe's Classic**:
  - J.M. Coetzee's "Foe" critically revisits Daniel Defoe’s "Robinson Crusoe."
  - Contrary to Defoe's original, Coetzee's Cruso does not document his journey. Instead, the account is given by a woman, Susan Barton.
  - Friday, initially introduced as a mere footprint in Defoe’s work, is introduced right at the beginning in Coetzee's version.
  - This twist challenges the traditional form of narration by an internal narrator.

- **Narrative Uncertainties**:
  - The target audience of Susan's narration remains ambiguous.
  - Flaubert's and Proust's narratives have clear subjects, whereas Coetzee flaunts the subject ambiguity.
  - Susan is the evident narrator from the start, yet there are hints suggesting another layer of narration above her.
  
- **Quotation Marks and Levels of Narration**:
  - Every paragraph starts with quotation marks until part III, but they don't always close.
  - Quotation marks hint at an embedding of Susan's narration within a broader story.
  - An address to a "you" suggests a potential higher-level narrator, later revealed to be Foe.

- **Susan's Self-Perception**:
  - Susan provides a descriptive view of herself that seems impossible for an internal narrator to convey.
  - She struggles with the differentiation between her lived experiences and the narration thereof.
  - Susan eventually views herself as merely a witness, lacking substance or the "truth" in her story.

- **Conversations with Foe**:
  - Susan engages in passionate discussions about storytelling with Foe.
  - There's a blurred distinction between who truly holds the narrative authority.
  - The lines between character and narrator blur further when Susan questions her own existence and reality.

- **Postmodernism's Narrative Complexity**:
  - Coetzee's novel embodies postmodernism by challenging conventional notions of narration.
  - The continuous uncertainty regarding "Who is speaking?" exemplifies the postmodernist approach.
  - While the novel grapples with subjectivity, it lacks a definitive subjective narrator and does not conform to realism.

**Key Idea**: Coetzee's "Foe" epitomizes postmodern literature by destabilizing traditional narrative structures, blurring the lines between character and narrator, and provoking readers to question the very nature of storytelling.

**Narrative Forms and Language Situations in Storytelling**

- **Emotive Function in Narration**
  - Narrators refer to themselves when expressing emotions, signifying self-reference.
  - There are different language situations: one about the contact between speaker and listener, and the other about external entities.
  - In certain contexts, narrative levels may intertwine or merge.
  - Example f.ii shows the interplay of personal and impersonal language situations, known as text interference.

- **Indicators of Personal vs. Impersonal Language Situations**
  - Personal indicators:
    - Personal pronouns like I/you.
    - First and second person grammar.
    - Certain past tenses.
    - Deictic indicators such as 'this, these', 'here', 'today, tomorrow'.
    - Emotive words and expressions.
    - Conative words and expressions, such as address, command, and question.
    - Modal verbs and adverbs indicating uncertainty.
  - Impersonal indicators:
    - Pronouns like he/she.
    - Third person grammar.
    - All past tenses.
    - Deictic indicators such as 'that/those', 'there', 'that day, the day after'.
    - Absence of emotive and conative expressions.
  - Depending on the reference signals, narratives can have a perceptible narrator or shift to a second level of personal language, which can be dramatic in nature.

- **Direct vs. Indirect Discourse**
  - Direct discourse is when an actor's speech is quoted verbatim, e.g., Elizabeth said: “I think I shall...”.
  - Indirect discourse narrates the words of an actor without quoting them directly.
    - The narrator uses words to represent what the actor might have said, losing some accuracy in the process.
    - Examples i, j, and k illustrate varying levels of accuracy in indirect discourse representation.
  - Three characteristics of indirect discourse:
    1. It's narrated at a higher level than the spoken words in the story.
    2. The narrator's text indicates that an actor's words are narrated using a declarative verb and a conjunction.
    3. Words of the actor are presented with maximum precision and elaboration.

**Key Idea**: Narration can take multiple forms and rely on different language situations, either representing direct speech or indirect discourse, with each having its indicators and nuances.

**Levels of Narration: Indirect and Free Indirect Discourse**

- **Indirect Discourse and Its Characteristics**:
  - A higher narration level than the spoken words in the fabula.
  - Narrated with a declarative verb and conjunction, or a substitute.
  - Actor's words seem to be rendered with high precision and elaboration.
- **Free Indirect Discourse (FID) Defined**:
  - A mixture or interference between the narrator’s text and actor’s text.
  - Lacks the explicit sign of indirect discourse.
  - Can be distinguished from the narrator’s text when:
    - Signals of a personal language situation refer to an actor.
    - Strikingly personal style is attributable to an actor.
    - More details about speech than necessary for the fabula's progression.
- **Variations of Representation**:
  - Direct speech: Precise text as spoken by the actor with explicit level changes.
  - Indirect speech: Narrator represents the actor's text, undergoing changes.
  - Free indirect discourse: A blend of the narrator's and actor's text.
  - Narrator’s text: No signals of the actor's personal language situation.
- **Analysis of Sentence Variations**:
  - Direct speech (m) is straightforward.
  - Indirect speech (n.i and n.ii) provides representation with varying precision.
  - Free indirect discourse (o.i and o.ii) fluctuates between actor and narrator dominance.
  - Narrator's text (p.i and p.ii) presents pure narration without actor interference.
- **Evolution from Actor to Narrator**:
  - Starting with indirect discourse, there's a diminishing representation of the actor's text.
  - Free indirect discourse exhibits interference of narrator’s text and actor’s text in varying proportions.
  - Pure narrator's text presents the words as acts, avoiding text interference.

**Key Idea**: The piece delves into the complexities of narration, distinguishing between indirect discourse, free indirect discourse, and pure narrator's text, while highlighting how each form represents or interferes with the actor's voice.

**Relationships in Narration: Primary vs. Embedded Texts**

- **Interference in Texts**:
  - When narrator's and actor's texts mix, distinct narrative levels blur.
  - Text interference can make identifying different levels challenging.
- **Narrator's vs. Actor's Texts**:
  - Narrator's text is termed “primary,” signaling its overarching role.
  - This doesn't denote superiority but indicates a hierarchical relationship.
  - Embedded actor’s text depends on the primary text, like a subordinate clause.
- **Intensity of Relationships**:
  - Relationship strength varies based on kind and intensity.
  - Quantitative aspect: More framing sentences lead to stronger dependence.
- **Examples of Embedded Texts**:
  - **Wuthering Heights**:
    - Primary narrator is the internal character, Lockwood.
    - Nelly Dean, the servant, narrates at a secondary level.
    - Her invisibility mimics the class hierarchy, making her a witness to everything.
  - **Arabian Nights**:
    - Scheherazade is the primary narrator, who tells stories to stay alive.
    - Multiple embedded narratives exist within her tales, reaching several degrees deep.
    - The structure mirrors the king's paranoid view of his wife.
    - The king's suspense relates both to the story's ending and Scheherazade's loyalty.

**Key Idea**: Narration can interweave primary and embedded texts, creating complex relationships that reflect both the structure of the narrative and broader societal themes or character perspectives.

**Relationships and Levels in Narration: Primary Fabula vs. Embedded Text**

- **Interplay between Primary and Embedded Fabula**:
  - If the embedded text tells a full story, it can overshadow the primary narrative.
  - Example: In *Arabian Nights*, Scheherazade's tale's grip makes one forget the main story's stakes.
  - The act of Scheherazade's narration is a crucial event in the primary story, emphasizing narrative's importance.
- **Functions of Embedded Stories**:
  - *Explaining the Primary Story*:
    - The embedded story can provide context or reasoning for the primary fabula.
    - Example: A woman's refusal to a marriage proposal is explained by her past experiences.
    - In some instances, this background doesn't influence the primary narrative's outcome.
  - *Influencing the Primary Fabula*:
    - The embedded story can impact the primary story's direction.
    - Example: A man, after hearing his beloved's past, might decide to give her a second chance.
- **Narration as a Creative Force**:
  - Embedded narratives are not just storytelling devices; they play a role in the narrative's overall poetic and thematic elements.
  - In novels like *Beloved*, secondary narratives help to gradually build main characters or events.
  - Narration can be seen as an act of creation, comparable to divine acts like those in Genesis.
  - The novel *Beloved* emphasizes the life-giving power of storytelling, where narrative layers contribute to its overall theme and meaning.

**Key Idea**: Narration, through primary and embedded texts, possesses a transformative and creative power that can not only provide context but can shape, influence, and breathe life into the main narrative.

**Interplay of Primary and Embedded Fabula in Narratives**

- **Importance of Intrinsic Interest:**
  - The tie between the primary and embedded texts intensifies with the degree of intrinsic interest of the fabula in both.
  - The embedded fabula in "Of Old People" intricately connects to the primary story, presenting events from “the Indies” that explain events in the primary fabula.
  
- **Dynamic Levels of Narration:**
  - Different focalizations within the subtext present views of the past, intertwined with present interpretations.
  - This dynamic plays into the narrative structure, allowing the past to influence the present.

- **Embedded Fabula and Primary Story Relationship:**
  - When minimal, the embedded text has lesser importance for the primary story.
  - If two fabulas resemble each other, they can be paraphrased to share common elements. This resemblance can be used as a "mirrortext", reflecting the primary fabula.

- **Borges's Exploration of Repetition and Resemblance:**
  - In "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote," Borges challenges conventional views on reading and writing.
  - Menard's transcription of Cervantes’s "Don Quixote" is seen as richer, even if verbally identical, emphasizing the influence of time, perspective, and historical context on interpretation.
  
- **Reversal of Reading and Writing:**
  - Reading becomes a form of rewriting. This interaction doesn’t happen in a void but in the context of the present.
  - Narratorial experiments emphasize the dynamic nature of art and literature, not as static entities but as evolving processes.

**Key Idea:** Narratives showcase the intricate relationships between primary and embedded stories, emphasizing the powerful influence of perspective, historical context, and interpretation in understanding and creating art and literature.

**Embedded Texts as Indicators for Reading Primary Fabula**

- **Paraphrase and Resemblance:**
  - If both primary and embedded fabulas share common elements when paraphrased, the embedded text serves as a sign of the primary one.
  - This embedded text within the primary story is termed as the “mirror-text”.
  
- **Mirror-text Functionality:**
  - **Positional Influence:** Depending on its location, a mirror-text can predict the primary fabula's ending.
  - **Veiling for Suspense:** Resemblance is sometimes concealed to uphold suspense. Recognizing this abstract resemblance typically happens after the primary fabula’s ending.
  - **Preserving Foreshadowing:** At times, the embedded fabula doesn't veil its resemblance, preserving its foreshadowing effect. This can lead to suspense where readers know the outcome but characters don't.
  - **Predictive vs. Retrospective:** A mirror-text towards the primary fabula’s end shifts its function from predicting the story to reflecting on what has already happened.

- **Variations in Suspense:**
  - There's a shift from the reader and character sharing suspense, to situations where only the character remains in the dark about the outcome.

- **Inflecting Significance through Mirror-text:**
  - A mere repetition of the primary story in the mirror-text isn't as captivating. Its primary role is to enhance or steer the meaning.
  - This can lift the narration to a higher, more abstract level, e.g., highlighting universal themes like inevitable fate or the individual versus bureaucracy.

- **Mirror-texts as Reading Directives:**
  - The embedded story hints at how the primary text should be read, acting as guidance for the reader's interpretation.

**Key Idea:** Embedded texts or “mirror-texts” within primary narratives serve as guides for readers, either predicting, reflecting upon, or inflecting the story’s significance.

**The Role of Mirror-Texts in Actor Interpretation and Literature**

- **Actor's Interpretation of Mirror-text:**
  - **Actor's Influence:** The actor can interpret the embedded story (mirror-text) as a sign, discerning their own story's trajectory, thus impacting its outcome.
  - **Case Study: “The Fall of the House of Usher” by Poe:**
    - The narrator saves himself by correctly interpreting the signs in the embedded text read aloud.
    - The terms “fall” and “house” have dual implications: the collapse of a building and the end of a family lineage.
    - Recognizing this duality allows the narrator to foresee impending doom, flee, and subsequently relay the tale.

- **Mirror-text's Implication in Literature:**
  - **Significance of Double Meanings:**
    - Recognizing dual meanings in literature is pivotal, as showcased in the actor's realization within the story.
    - This recognition serves as a directive or "prescription" for reading literature, emphasizing its multifaceted nature.
  - **Embedded Text as Poetics:** 
    - The embedded story not only conveys the story's events but also embodies broader notions about literature and its dual or multiple interpretations.
    - It posits that true literature possesses multiple interpretations or it doesn't qualify as literature.
  
- **Title's Indicative Power:**
  - Titles often hint at the embedded meanings, but their full depth typically requires unpacking the entire narrative. In this case, the title "The Fall of the House of Usher" is seemingly straightforward, but unveils deeper interpretations upon thorough reading.

**Key Idea:** Embedded texts or "mirror-texts" play a critical role in both influencing characters' decisions within a story and illuminating the multifaceted nature of literature itself.

**Understanding Non-Narrative Embedded Texts in Narratives**

- **Nature of Embedded Texts:**
  - **Predominantly Non-narrative:** Most embedded texts within narratives don't narrate a separate story.
  - **Variety of Forms:** They range from general assertions, discussions between actors, descriptions, confidences, to other forms.
  - **Dominance of Dialogue:** A significant form of embedded text is dialogue, where actors, not the primary narrator, produce meaning.
    - Resembles dramatic texts, which consist mainly of actor utterances.
    - The more a narrative contains dialogue, the closer it leans towards being dramatic.
    - Interventions by the primary narrator in dialogues (e.g., "Elizabeth said") maintain a clear hierarchical distinction between main and embedded text.

- **Monologues and Soliloquies:**
  - One actor's spoken or thought expressions.
  - Content can vary widely, from confidences to self-reflections.
  - They inherently don't differ from other language usage within the text.

- **Interlocution in Narratives:**
  - All narratives imply a speaker and an addressed listener.
  - The speaker's "I" is only valid with a listener's "you."
  - E.g., in *Arabian Nights*:
    - Sheherazade addresses two interlocutors: the king and her sister Dinarzade.
    - Dinarzade, hidden, prompts the story continuation while the king listens for entertainment.
    - This creates a layered narrative where Sheherazade addresses both a primary listener (the king) and offers encoded messages to her sister.

- **Relationship Between Primary and Embedded Texts:**
  - Depends on explicit commentary by N1 (the primary narrator) or implied hints.
  - The embedded text can have various relationships with the primary: continuation, explanation, similarity, contradiction, or no connection.
  - A single comment from the primary narrator can drastically alter the perceived meaning of the entire text.
  
**Key Idea:** Non-narrative embedded texts, predominantly dialogues, play crucial roles within narratives, influencing meaning, dynamics, and depth, and showcasing the complex interplay between narrators, actors, and listeners.

## Remarks

**Narrator and Author Distinction in Literature**

- **Barthes and Foucault on Authorship**
  - Roland Barthes proclaims the “death of the author”, igniting significant debate.
  - Michel Foucault challenges the conventional ideas of authorship, introducing four alternate concepts.
  - Foucault promotes a multiplicity of meanings, suggesting the author and work interact within a larger discursive field.
  
- **Concept of the Narrator**
  - The term "implied author", introduced by Wayne C. Booth, is differentiated from the narrator.
  - Concerns with the "implied author":
    - Implies a total inference of meaning from a text.
    - Can be harnessed to grant undue authority on a text's interpretation.
    - Not specific to narrative texts.
  - The commodification of the author in a neoliberal culture presents challenges for objective narrative interpretation.
  - The narrator is not merely a visible storyteller but is the agent conveying the text. Confined definition is crucial to prevent misunderstandings.

- **Textual Aspects and Linguistics**
  - Direct, indirect, and free indirect discourse pertain to the narrative agent's relationship to the object of narration.
  - The confusion between pragmatics and semantics arises from the interpretation of the implied author.
  - The term “omniscient narrator” is contested and criticized, as it suggests a fantastical and manipulative presence.

- **Narrative Techniques and Theories**
  - “Multidimensional memory” draws parallels between historical events like slavery and the Holocaust.
  - Differences between narration and nonnarrative commentary are highlighted.
  - Free indirect discourse theories, like “sentences without speaker”, raise issues of narrative responsibility.
  - Text interferences, mirror-texts, and description techniques are explored.
  - Concepts like the narratee, dialogue in language use, and intertextuality add depth to the narrative study.

- **Literary Examples and Interpretations**
  - Works such as "Nightwood", "Don Quixote", "Beloved", and "La modification" are discussed.
  - Second-person narratives and their association with postmodernism are examined.
  - The political implications of narrative techniques, like the poetics of apostrophe, are also discussed.

**Key Idea:** The relationship between the narrator and the author is intricate and multi-layered, with theorists like Barthes and Foucault challenging conventional notions of authorship, and various narrative techniques enriching the fabric of storytelling.

# 2 Story: Aspects

## 1: Preliminary Remarks

**Summary: Understanding Narrative Aspects and Manipulation**

- **Defining Aspects**: 
  - Features distinguishing a structured story from its text and the fabula.
  - Story seen as the result of ordering – a product of subjectivization.
  
- **Role of Textual Analysis**: 
  - Aims to discern the conditions of the reception process.
  - Explores why the same fabula may be perceived differently based on its presentation or medium.
  
- **Manipulation in Narrative**:
  - Refers to the treatment of the fabula.
  - Manipulation guides reader interpretation. It's not just about creating characters but ensuring events form a coherent story.
  
- **Importance of Perspective**:
  - Critical means of manipulation in storytelling.
  - Determines how elements of the fabula are presented and, consequently, their meaning to the reader.
  
- **Focalization**:
  - Technical aspect placing the point of view with a specific agent.
  - Main tool for subjectifying the story, making it more personal and relatable.
  
- **Story Logic and Expectations**:
  - Depending on the narrative's nature (classical, realist, modernist, etc.), readers have specific expectations.
  - Annoyance arises when there are unexplained deviations or inconsistencies.
  
- **Randomness in Storytelling**:
  - Some story aspects may appear random but have deeper meaning.
  - The concept of randomness in storytelling is relative based on reader expectations and acceptance.

**Key Idea**: Narratives are subjectivized through aspects and manipulations, with perspective and focalization playing critical roles in influencing readers' interpretations and reactions.

## 2: Temporality

**Summary: The Complexity and Intricacies of Temporality in Narratives**

- **Understanding Temporality**:
  - Time is a fundamental aspect of narrative arts such as theatre, film, music, etc.
  - Yet, narratives introduce complexities to the straightforward concept of time.
  
- **Contrasting Timescales**:
  - Regulated time (clocks, schedules) differs from monumental and historical time perceptions.
  - Monumental time aims for eternity, contrasting the transient nature of daily experiences.
  - Micro-time: Brief moments and short-lived experiences, like a mother's interrupted sleep pattern with a newborn.
  
- **Immigrant’s Experience of Time**:
  - The journey of undocumented immigrants showcases the profound complexities of temporality.
  - Intense moments during border crossings, waiting periods, rushing and stagnation coexisting.
  - Lingering in the present due to uncertainties, causing past memories to be frozen and creating a sense of disenfranchisement.
  
- **Temporal Depth in "Arabian Nights"**:
  - The king is bound by day-to-day time, representing his fears (chronophobia and gynophobia).
  - Sheherazade manipulates temporality, borrowing time from the narratives she shares to keep the king intrigued.
  - The story highlights different forms of temporality: the duration of storytelling, the events within the stories, and the suspense in-between.

- **Narrative Techniques to Evoke Temporal Experiences**:
  - Narratives utilize specific devices to craft varied experiences of time for readers.
  - These devices evoke the characterizations of different temporal experiences as mentioned earlier.

**Key Idea**: Narratives delve deep into the complexities of time, presenting multifaceted temporal experiences that intertwine personal experiences with broader societal contexts.

## 3: Sequential Ordering

**Complexities of Sequential Ordering in Narratives**

- **Inherent Linearity vs. Narrative Reality**:
  - All written texts, including narratives, exhibit inherent linearity where one word or image follows another.
  - Narratives often deviate from this inherent linearity, presenting events out of chronological order.
  - This deviation, though non-linear in nature, creates intense reading experiences, making readers engage deeply with the text.

- **Types of Deviations: Examples**
  - Events may be presented contrary to logical sequence, as exemplified by John's ringing the doorbell and his underlying desire.
  - Anachronies or chronological deviations can be subtle or profound, requiring readers to piece together the intended sequence.

- **Purpose and Impact of Deviations**:
  - Breaking linearity compels more intensive reading and reflection.
  - Playing with sequential ordering serves many functions:
    - Drawing attention
    - Emphasizing certain events or feelings
    - Creating suspense
    - Showing various interpretations of an event
    - Highlighting the difference between expectation and realization.

- **Narrative Techniques and Examples**:
  - Some narratives use chronological deviations for effect, such as the child’s alternating memories in the book "Something Very Sorry."
  - Techniques of chronological deviation differ across narratives, from the intricate plays on time in Gabriel García Márquez’s "One Hundred Years of Solitude" to the simple yet profound waiting sequence in Marguerite Duras’s "L’après-midi de Monsieur Andesmas."
  - Anachrony can be used for both structural and thematic purposes.

- **Complexity of Anachronies**:
  - Anachronies can be subtle, making even seemingly chronological narratives complex upon deeper examination.
  - Some novels, like the classic 19th-century realistic novels, begin in medias res and use anachrony to weave the narrative together.
  - The application of sequential ordering and chronological deviations differs across narratives, offering varying reader experiences and interpretations.

**Key Idea**: 
Sequential ordering in narratives is a sophisticated tool that, while breaking inherent linearity, intensifies reading experiences, adds depth to storytelling, and emphasizes various thematic concerns.

**Chronological Manipulation in Storytelling**

- **Introduction to Anachrony**:
  - Anachrony refers to events that are presented out of their chronological order.
  - The term is divided into two categories: retroversion (past) and anticipation (future).
  - The terms "flashback" and "flashforward" are avoided due to their vagueness and psychological connotations.

- **Example from Homer’s Iliad**:
  - The beginning of the Iliad provides a comprehensive anachrony, starting with Achilles' grudge.
  - There's a series of causes and effects demonstrating how the narrative unfolds out of order.
  - Formula representation of this anachrony is A4-B5-C3-D2-E1.

- **Purpose of Anachrony**:
  - This storytelling technique offers a glimpse of what the story entails at its commencement.
  - It emphasizes the influence of external powers on human events and destinies.
  - A summarization presented in the beginning can encapsulate the entirety of the book's content.

- **Modern Story Example – Harry Mulisch’s “What Happened to Sergeant Massuro?”**:
  - This story provides another take on chronological manipulation with a different sequential ordering.
  - Harry Mulisch's life, including his experiences during the war and his beliefs about art, profoundly influences his writing.
  - The narrative discusses Massuro's transformation into stone during an expedition.
  - Symbolic structures in the story are compared to Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.
  - The formula for this anachrony is A5-B4-C3-D6-E2-F1-G2.

- **Importance of Contrast and Violation of Chronology**:
  - The story presents contrasts, such as the difference between familiar and exotic names.
  - The disruption of chronological sequence helps depict underlying confusion in the fabula.

**Key Idea**: Chronological manipulation, or anachrony, in storytelling, allows authors to emphasize key themes, create contrasts, and provide comprehensive summaries at the outset of their narratives, guiding readers through a more profound understanding of the tale.

**Understanding Anachrony in Literature**

- **Nuances of Anachrony**:
  - Different levels of chronological deviations exist, some are in the consciousness, and some reflect actual time deviations.
    - The complexity of anachrony can emulate visual perception.
    - Distinguishing between what is a "real" chronological deviation and what is not can be intricate.
  - Not all anachronies are of equal narrative importance.
    - Some texts might center around "unreal" anachronies.
    - Defining the primary time in a story is essential but can be contentious.
    - The narrative of Patrick Chamoiseau’s "Texaco" showcases how the past can impact and rearrange the present narrative.
  - Differentiating between "false" anachronies and others requires the classification of subjective and objective.
    - Subjective anachronies exist only when the contents of consciousness dwell in the past or future, not in the consciousness itself.
  - Determining specific periods in fabula can sometimes be challenging due to overlapping timelines and intricate narrative structures.

- **Sequential Ordering and Its Challenges**:
  - Analysis of "stream-of-consciousness" literature is exempt from chronological scrutiny.
  - The distinction between real anachrony and the moment of speech becomes blurred in direct discourses, making analysis intricate.
  - Positioning narrative units relative to each other is crucial, even if deciding on a primary time isn't.
    - Some texts present a convoluted relationship between story and fabula, making exhaustive analysis impractical.
    - Genette’s analysis of Proust’s novel showcases this relativity in time units.
  - Anachronies can be embedded within one another, making dissection complex.
    - E.g., The retroversion in John's lament about marrying Mary presents multiple layers of time interpretation.
  - Some words or contexts, like "bank," introduce ambiguities. This uncertainty in interpretation can be intentional for producing effects like humor or confusion.

- **Key Idea**: Anachrony in literature presents layered deviations from chronological order, leading to intricate narrative structures and deeper thematic exploration. While some deviations are more perceptual or subjective, others reshape the narrative's core structure, underscoring the multifaceted nature of time in storytelling.

**Anachrony and Its Impact on Sequential Ordering**

- **Defining Anachrony**:
  - An anachrony involves events separated by a time interval from the present, disrupting the story's current development.
  - Anachrony can be divided based on distance from the primary fabula.

- **Types of Anachrony Based on Distance**:
  - **Retroversion**:
    - **External Retroversion**: Occurs entirely outside the primary fabula's time span.
    - **Internal Retroversion**: Takes place within the time span of the primary fabula.
    - **Mixed Retroversion**: Starts outside the primary time span and ends within it.
  - **Anticipation**:
    - Three categories similar to retroversion: external, internal, and mixed. However, these are less common.

- **Examples and Applications**:
  - **Massuro's Arrival**:
    - Occurs two years before the letter writing.
    - The doctor’s examination and letter writing come after Massuro’s death and are parts of the process to certify the cause of death, which spans six days.
  - **Butor’s La modification**:
    - Primary story-time involves a train journey from Paris to Rome.
    - Flashbacks span years, reflecting on a broken marriage. All flashbacks are subjective in nature.
  - **Categorizing Retroversion**:
    - Retroversion can be internal or external based on which period is considered primary.
      - Example: Massuro's story becomes an internal retroversion if the period from renewed acquaintance to letter writing is primary. If only the letter writing is primary, retroversion is external.

- **Making Choices on Primary Time Span**:
  - Ideally, the choice should account for most phenomena within the story.
  - E.g., Considering the period between meeting and letter writing as primary seems logical for Massuro's story. This means that some retroversions can be classified as mixed, starting before and continuing until a particular event.

- **Key Idea**: Anachrony, based on distance from the primary fabula, provides tools to understand events' chronological deviations, enhancing narrative depth and structure.

**Functions and Impacts of Retroversion in Storytelling**

- **Subjective Retroversions in "La modification"**:
  - Serve to explain a man's dissatisfaction with his wife and apprehensions about confronting his mistress.
  - Reinforce the idea that dissatisfaction is inherently subjective, thereby highlighting potential political implications in storytelling.

- **Anecdotes and Relationships in "Sergeant Massuro"**:
  - Recollection of a past anecdote reveals an unspoken bond between two individuals.
  - Enhances understanding of their present relationship and explains the narrator's struggle to comprehend Massuro’s unexplained death.
  - Suggests a colonial theme, implying a hidden narrative depth related to colonial experiences.
  - Adds to the growing atmosphere of mystery within the story.

- **Function of External Retroversions**:
  - Provides background or historical context about characters that are essential for understanding current events.

- **Characteristics and Functions of Internal Retroversions**:
  - Can either overlap with the primary narrative or offer fresh insights.
    - When introducing new characters, reveals their past actions or motivations that later prove crucial.
    - When overlapping, they often fill gaps left in the primary story, supplying missing information.
  - In some narratives, like Victorian novels, certain ellipses are intentionally left out (e.g., childbirth) for decency.
  - Internal retroversions can also revisit and expand upon past events, altering or enhancing their meaning.
    - Can present the same event in a different light, altering its significance.
    - Utilized in works like Proust's for reflecting on the past and in detective novels for adding twists to the story.

- **Key Idea**: Retroversion in storytelling, whether subjective, external, or internal, provides depth, fills gaps, and can shift the interpretation of events, enriching narrative complexity and perspective.



**Understanding Anachrony in Literature**

- **Anachrony's Span and Distance**:
  - Span represents the duration covered by an anachrony (like a flashback or foreshadowing). For example, the span could be a month, while the distance (the gap between the main narrative and the anachrony) could be a year.
  - In Couperus’s "Of Old People," the murder references have a 60-year distance, varying spans, and are examples of incomplete anachronies.

- **Incomplete vs. Complete Anachrony**:
  - Incomplete: Only parts of the event or situation are recalled, leaving gaps.
  - Complete: The entire event or situation is recalled, from beginning to end.

- **Classical Illustrations**:
  - Beginning a narrative "in medias res" is a common use of anachrony. An example is when a story starts mid-plot, and earlier events are then recalled.
  - "Odyssey" Book 19 demonstrates an incomplete retroversion about Ulysses's scar and its origin.

- **Punctual vs. Durative Anachrony**:
  - Punctual: Evokes a specific moment in time, like the exact time Ulysses got his wound.
  - Durative: Covers a longer period, such as the days Ulysses's wound was healing.

- **Usage of Punctual and Durative Forms in Literature**:
  - Different combinations can influence the narrative style.
  - For example, Proust's "À la recherche du temps perdu" masterfully alternates between punctual and durative retroversions.

- **Example from "Migas de pan"**:
  - The novel showcases the trauma of time repetition. A captured Holocaust survivor's past trauma is echoed in the present experiences of his family.
  - The story line revolves around a "tragedy without crisis," emphasizing the endless anticipation and effect of time.

- **The Role of Time in the Narrative**:
  - In the novel, the son's perspective on time shifts, influenced by his father's traumatic history and their current ordeal. The home becomes a representation of time imprisonment.
  - The experience transcends mere postmemory, as the son feels trapped in a repetition of unexperienced events.

**Key Idea**: Anachrony in literature, whether incomplete or complete and punctual or durative, influences narrative style and structure, offering depth to storytelling and altering characters' and readers' perception of time.

**Summary: Concepts of Anticipation and Sequential Ordering in Narratives**

- **Anachrony and Anticipation**
  - Anachrony is relevant to both retroversions and anticipations.
  - Anticipations can hint at the end of the fabula, impacting tension and overall narrative perception.

- **Opening Summaries**
  - Traditional anticipations sometimes begin with a summary that foreshadows the end.
  - This form diminishes suspense about the ending but can increase interest in the unfolding of events.

- **First-person Novels and Future References**
  - Narratives with a CN (first-person novels) are apt for future references.
  - A narrative presenting its past can allude to its future, creating layers of time perspectives.

- **Uncertainty in Narratives**
  - Stories, like "La modification," can create tension by keeping some events uncertain.
  - This uncertainty can affect the reader's engagement and interpretation.

- **Implicit Hints in Madame Bovary**
  - "Madame Bovary" contains implicit anticipations that challenge their own readability.
  - Such hints shift the novel's genre from realist to (post)modernist.

- **Types of Anticipations**
  - Can be grouped as internal or external.
  - Internal anticipations clarify events, connecting past and future events in the narrative.
  - Iterative anticipations present events as a recurring series, balancing between repetition and novelty.

- **Promise and Fulfilment in L’aprèsmidi de Monsieur Andesmas**
  - The tension arises from an unfulfilled promise, with the narrative revolving around waiting.
  - Temporal play creates emotional suspense.

- **Distinction Between Announcements and Hints**
  - Announcements are explicit about future events, while hints are implicit.
  - Announcements might reduce suspense, but hints can increase it.
  - False hints or details can manipulate readers' anticipation and suspense.

**Key Idea:** 
Anticipations in narratives, whether explicit or implicit, play a critical role in shaping readers' engagement, understanding, and suspense throughout the story.

**Understanding Achrony and Temporal Deviations in Narratives**

* **Definition of Achrony**
  * A deviation of time in a story that cannot be further analyzed due to ambiguous or insufficient information.
  
* **Examples of Temporal Deviations Resembling Achrony**
  * **Anticipation-within-Retroversion**: A forward reference within a back-reference. It contrasts the expected present with the realized present.
    * When used, it can highlight the fictionality of the fabula or main story.
  * **Retroversion-within-Anticipation**: Foretelling how current situations will be revealed in the future.
    * It foreshadows an upcoming realization or revelation.
  * **Anticipation vs. Retroversion**: Events yet to happen chronologically may have already been portrayed in the story, creating a temporal discrepancy.
  
* **Definite Achrony Forms**
  * **Undated Achrony**: Does not indicate its direction, distance, or span.
    * Example: "I have never seen him without his wig."
  * **Grouping by Non-Chronological Criteria**: Events ordered by criteria other than time, like spatial connections.
    * Proust and modernists like Virginia Woolf used such visual, non-chronological narrative styles.
  
* **The Disconnect Between Linearity of Fabula and Presentation**
  * The chronological order of events in the story and their presentation can sometimes lack correspondence.
  
* **Temporal Distortions in 'Migas de pan'**
  * The novel by Azriel Bibliowicz uses achrony as its main trope.
  * Addresses the trauma of the Holocaust and its effects on subsequent generations.
  * The novel’s focus on captivity reflects the sense of time and trauma as a form of captivity.
  * Emphasizes the deep sense of time through spatial arrangements and reflections.
  
* **Achrony’s Broader Significance in Literature**
  * A way to represent trauma, nonlinear experiences, and challenge traditional narrative conceptions of time.

**Key Idea**: Achrony and other temporal deviations offer a unique narrative tool to represent non-linear experiences, trauma, and challenge conventional understandings of time within literature.
