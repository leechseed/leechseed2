> *This exercise aims to generate narratives in a scalable manner. However, the main problem lies in its inability to clearly define the character's scope. Properly answering this question requires initial understanding of the scale at which the story's queries should be approached - whether at a detailed, localized scale or at a larger, more comprehensive story scale. When considering the grand story scale, the challenge is the limited data available to establish the story's bounds. Therefore, it would be more practical to select a scale size that seems the most convenient. Once you've established this foundational overview, you can incrementally build upon it to achieve the desired scale.*
