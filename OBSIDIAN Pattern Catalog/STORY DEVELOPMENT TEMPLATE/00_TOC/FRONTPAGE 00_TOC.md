### 002_The Writer's Compass - DODD, NANCY ELLEN
Dodd's book primarily delves into the less-explored aspects of mainstream narrative components that authors frequently overlook. Her meticulous attention to detail and clear writing style make it easier for readers to grasp her insights and incorporate them into a broader writing framework.
*My main glean from Dodd is her delve into the process of writing for the writer themselves. If I have trouble in the meta, I should turn to her first.*

### 002_The Complete Handbook of Novel Writing - READER'S DIGEST 
The book, authored by the editors of Reader's Digest, aims to offer a comprehensive guide to novel writing for budding writers. Although it may fall short in offering in-depth analysis or high-quality content in some areas, it compensates by covering a wide range of topics pertinent to the craft. Notably, the last chapters stand out as a precious resource, where renowned authors share solutions to common challenges that many writers face. Their perspectives, honed through years of experience, offer deep and tangible insights invaluable to individuals devoted to mastering the art of writing.
*The Handbook certainly presents an intriguing approach. In my view, it serves better as a 'Troubleshooter' or a tool to cover various aspects of storytelling components comprehensively, rather than acting as a comprehensive foundation of literary theory. It seems more apt as a quick reference guide to have at your side rather than a substantive teaching resource.
Unfortunately, the quality of the content in many chapters leaves much to be desired. It appears that several contributors have not invested sufficient effort in providing substantial information in their sections. Instead, they seem to exploit this platform to direct readers to their social media pages, which is quite disappointing.
In my opinion, this kind of approach from authors, who seem more focused on promoting their personal brand and financial gains rather than advancing the art of literature, is seriously undermining the essence of literary craftsmanship. It brings to mind David Foster Wallace's critique of the prevalent culture of 'excessive entertainment,' where the genuine nourishment of literature is being overshadowed by a more self-serving approach to writing.*

### 003_Story Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting - MCKEE, ROBERT
During my late teenage years, I immersed myself in studying McKee's renowned narrative and storytelling techniques. This educational journey emerged as perhaps the most significant influence from any resources found in my 'Theory of Composition Body of Knowledge' (TOCBOK). McKee's teachings, which prominently feature the concept of dualism, profoundly shaped my understanding of the vital role dualism plays in crafting a captivating story.
*While McKee's brilliance cannot be denied, it is both his strength and weakness. He passionately shares profound insights, albeit in a manner that can sometimes lack a structured and practical approach essential for actual writing. Nevertheless, his brilliant ideas serve as invaluable references, complementing more structured and methodical storytelling theories and frameworks.*

### 003_Dramataica - PHILLIPS, MELANIE ANNE & HUNTLEY, CHRIS 
Dramatica is a storytelling model that places a strong emphasis on structure, using it as the foundation around which all other narrative elements, ranging from the overarching themes and universe to the character's actions and decisions, are built.
*Dramatica is a sophisticated and potent storytelling framework known for its capacity to create grand narratives. This model offers both the freedom of spontaneous writing and the security of structured planning. While it has its limitations, relying solely on the Dramatica structure for a story can be a valuable exercise. Ideally, using the theory's methodology to establish intricate nested structures for each story is a more effective approach. In my opinion, Dramatica serves as a fundamental foundation, potentially the starting point for rigorous story development.*

### 005_Dramatic Storytelling & Narrative Design - BERGER, ROSS
An interesting introduction to Transmedia in the realm of Video Games. What I Wanted to glean from this book is how transmedia can be applied to literature. The most important takes from this book are the broadest of strokes. 
*I believe the best lessons I learned from this is to prepare for growth by having good documentation. Good documentation IE: an Obsidian notebook with the development notes available to those in different industries. This will empower those in other industries to understand the meat under the bikini so to speak.*
