> **00 - TOC** *(Theory of Composition)* -  Introduces a myriad of theories, models, and philosophies surrounding narrative and story. Using these tenets of story, the goal is to distill and craft my own theory of composition.


# Theory of Composition - Body of Knowledge

### 00_Dramataica - PHILLIPS, MELANIE ANNE & HUNTLEY, CHRIS 
Dramatica is a storytelling model that places a strong emphasis on structure, using it as the foundation around which all other narrative elements, ranging from the overarching themes and universe to the character's actions and decisions, are built.
*Dramatica is a sophisticated and potent storytelling framework known for its capacity to create grand narratives. This model offers both the freedom of spontaneous writing and the security of structured planning. While it has its limitations, relying solely on the Dramatica structure for a story can be a valuable exercise. Ideally, using the theory's methodology to establish intricate nested structures for each story is a more effective approach. In my opinion, Dramatica serves as a fundamental foundation, potentially the starting point for rigorous story development.*


### 00_Story Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting - MCKEE, ROBERT
During my late teenage years, I immersed myself in studying McKee's renowned narrative and storytelling techniques. This educational journey emerged as perhaps the most significant influence from any resources found in my 'Theory of Composition Body of Knowledge' (TOCBOK). McKee's teachings, which prominently feature the concept of dualism, profoundly shaped my understanding of the vital role dualism plays in crafting a captivating story.
*While McKee's brilliance cannot be denied, it is both his strength and weakness. He passionately shares profound insights, albeit in a manner that can sometimes lack a structured and practical approach essential for actual writing. Nevertheless, his brilliant ideas serve as invaluable references, complementing more structured and methodical storytelling theories and frameworks.*
