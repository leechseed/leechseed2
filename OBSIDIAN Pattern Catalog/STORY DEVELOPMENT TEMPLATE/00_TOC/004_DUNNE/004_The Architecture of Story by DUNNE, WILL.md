## style: how characters and events are depicted 
- **Definition of Style**:
  - Style in theater refers to how characters and events are portrayed in the writing and staging of a play. It includes elements like sets, props, costumes, lighting, sound, and acting.
- **Realistic Style**:
  - This style aims to mirror real life, often without acknowledging the audience. Examples include works by Henrik Ibsen, Lynne Nottage, and David Mamet.
  - Example: 'Night, Mother by Marsha Norman is set in a country home with events unfolding in real-time, emphasizing the illusion of reality.
  - Another Example: Edmond by David Mamet, although aiming for realism, compresses events spanning months into a 90-minute performance.
- **Nonrealistic Style**:
  - Also known as presentational style, this employs devices like exaggeration, symbolism, and distortion to present a reality contrasting the real world. It often reminds the audience they are watching a play. Settings can be strange or otherworldly.
  - Examples include plays by Bertolt Brecht, Eugène Ionesco, and José Rivera.
  - Forms of Nonrealism: Includes magic realism, expressionism, surrealism, romanticism, postmodernism, and more.
  - Example: In Cloud 9 by Caryl Churchill, there are routine occurrences of time shifts and gender bending.
  - Another Example: Samuel Beckett’s Endgame portrays the last days of survivors after an apocalypse in a surreal setting.
- **Combination of Styles**:
  - Some writers, like Arthur Miller in After the Fall, blend both realistic and nonrealistic elements in their plays.

### **Key Idea: The style in theater can be realistic, aiming to mirror everyday life, or nonrealistic, which employs various devices to depict an artificial reality, with some plays combining elements of both.**

## dramatic focus: main character point of view
  - **Character Focus:** 
    - This pertains to whose story is being told in the play. It could be one individual (e.g., Hamlet) or a group (e.g., the Ranevskaya family in "The Cherry Orchard").
  - **Point of View:**
    - This decides how the story will be revealed to the audience. It can be:
      1. **Objective:** Audience observes the external world of characters and draws their own conclusions. It offers a "fly on the wall" perspective.
      2. **Subjective:** Audience accesses the inner world of characters. They hear and see the characters’ thoughts, perceptions, and memories. This might include flashbacks, hallucinations, and inner monologues.
    - The point of view can also dictate the limitations of what the audience sees, determining the scenes, characters, and time frame the audience observes.
  
### Key Idea: The dramatic focus dictates the central narrative and perspective of a play, guiding how audiences engage with and interpret the story.

#### Doubt: A Parable
  - **Character Focus: Single Protagonist:** 
    - The play revolves around Sister Aloysius, the main character.
  - **Point of View: Objective:** 
    - The audience has a limited objective perspective. While they follow Aloysius's journey, they also see events beyond her experience. For instance, they never see the rectory where Father Flynn has private meetings with students, which raises questions about his actions.
#### Key Idea: Doubt: A Parable" focuses on Sister Aloysius's journey, but uses objective limitations to highlight themes of doubt and uncertainty.


#### Topdog/Underdog
  - **Character Focus: Dual Protagonist:** 
    - The play equally focuses on the characters Booth and Lincoln.
  - **Point of View: Both Objective and Subjective:** 
    - The audience sees the shared world of Booth and Lincoln but also gains access to their individual thoughts and feelings, emphasizing their complex relationship.
#### Key Idea: "Topdog/Underdog" is a power struggle between two brothers, and the play utilizes both objective and subjective viewpoints to illuminate their dynamic.


#### The Clean House
  - **Character Focus: Group Protagonist:** 
    - The play centers on three women, Lane, Matilde, and Virginia, each representing different societal roles.
  - **Point of View: Both Objective and Subjective:** 
    - The audience's objective view is mainly restricted to Lane's house, symbolizing achievement and social status. There's also a subjective view, letting the audience into certain characters' internal worlds, but this is selective and limited.
#### Key Idea: "The Clean House" explores the lives of three distinct women, and their quests for connection and self-discovery, using a mix of objective and subjective storytelling.


#### Technical Considerations
  - **Character's Mind Access:** 
    - In plays, sometimes the audience can see what's happening inside a character's mind, but this access is often limited to specific characters and moments.
  - **Literal Access:** 
    - Even if a play offers a subjective point of view, it doesn't always allow the audience full access to every character's thoughts and imaginations.
#### Key Idea: Technical choices in playwriting can be used selectively to provide insight into a character's internal world, but full access is often limited to preserve narrative intrigue.

### Analyzing Your Story
```
Sure, here is a breakdown of the provided text into a list format that you can use to analyze your story:

### Analysis Checklist for Your Story

#### **Dramatic Focus**
1. Define the dramatic focus of your story.

#### **Character Focus**
2. Whose story is it? Identify your protagonist(s).
3. After the protagonist, who is the most important character in the story?
4. Onstage or off, what is the most important relationship between characters? 
5. How do you reveal that importance to the audience?

#### **Point of View**
6. Think about the vantage point from which the audience will observe story events. Is this point of view objective (external), subjective (internal), or a combination of the two?
7. Whether objective or subjective, an unlimited point of view allows the audience to see any combination of characters onstage. A limited point of view requires that a certain character or characters be present for a scene to occur. How broad or narrow is the point of view now? 
8. If limited, who gives the audience access to story events? 
9. Why is that character the best choice for the job?
10. In what locations will the audience be able to observe dramatic action? During what time periods?
11. Does the point of view provide enough access to story events for the audience to understand and participate in what is happening? 
12. If not, how can you expand the point of view, and how would that affect the story?
13. What important parts of the dramatic journey will the audience not be able to see? 
14. Identify any limitations that influence the audience’s experience of the story.
15. Are the limitations in point of view sufficient to generate suspense? If not, what other limitations might be imposed? How would they affect the story?
16. Do any scenes in the script violate the point of view that you have established? If so, how might you either redefine the point of view or change a scene that doesn’t fit it?
17. If we are able to see or hear inside of a character’s mind, whose inner world will we enter?
18. Why that character? 
19. How will his or her inner world be presented dramatically?

## rules of the game: how things work in this particular story p. 16 
- **Understanding the World:** Writers must grasp the world their characters live in and the basic rules that govern actions and possibilities within that environment.
  - In a realistic story, these rules mimic real-world laws of nature, such as the fact that once something is dead, it can't be brought back to life.
  - Complex or rare dramatic events might require writers to research in order to depict them accurately. For example, understanding the progression of a disease.
- **Nonrealistic Stories:** These tales have unique rules that can differ or add to real-world laws.
  - Such stories might allow for fantastical elements like a man growing animal ears or inanimate objects coming to life.
  - The uniqueness of such worlds can affect characters in both positive and negative ways. 
- **Examples from Plays:**
  - *Doubt:* This is a realistic play that follows real-world rules.
  - *Topdog/Underdog:* Even with unusual story elements, it abides by real-world laws.
  - *The Clean House:* This play, grounded in magic realism, combines the extraordinary with the mundane, showcasing several unique rules.
     - Characters can break the fourth wall, chronological order isn't a necessity, magical events are routine, and objects can possess mystical qualities.

### Key Idea: Understanding the "rules of the game" in storytelling is essential for crafting a believable narrative, whether set in a realistic or nonrealistic world.

#### Magic Realism in "The Clean House"

**Summary and Clarification:**
- **Magic Realism Defined:** A combination of the fantastical with the ordinary, creating a unique set of storytelling rules.
- **Direct Audience Interaction:** Characters, like Matilde, can directly address the audience.
- **Visualization of Imagination:** The audience can witness a character's imaginative figments, as shown with Matilde's parental imagery.
- **Shared Imagination:** Characters can see figments from another character's mind, like when Matilde sees Lane's imagined scenario.
- **Magical Occurrences:** Unusual, magical events, such as Charles and Ana's surgery scene, are normalized.
- **Flexible Chronology:** Events don't necessarily follow a linear timeline, as observed with Charles and Ana's love story.
- **Merged Timelines:** The past and present can occur simultaneously. An instance is Matilde's retelling of a fight while the audience sees it.
- **Conjoined Locations:** Two distinct places can overlap, like Charles' Alaska journey affecting Lane's living room.
- **Mystical Objects:** Common objects can have extraordinary properties or effects, such as the mystical behavior of apples and spices in the play.
- **Deadly Jokes:** A unique rule where characters can die from laughter after hearing the perfect joke.
#### **Key Idea: The Clean House exemplifies magic realism by blending ordinary events with the fantastical, introducing unique rules that defy conventional storytelling norms.**

### Analyzing Your Story
```
Certainly, here's the structured text formatted in Markdown as a list using the exact text provided:



#### Review how the world of your story works

**If the world is realistic...**
- Its physical operating rules have been set by nature. However, you may need to flesh out specific rules for any natural phenomenon that is rare or complicated.
  - Is additional research necessary to understand any specific character traits or story developments? If so, what topics do you need to address?
  - If technical information is important to the story, how much of it does the audience really need to know in order to understand and believe story events?
  - Where in the script is this technical information stated, who tells it to whom, and what is the “here and now” dramatic reason for doing so? Can any of this information be integrated more seamlessly into the dramatic action? If so, how?
  - Have you included all of the technical facts needed for the audience to understand story events? If not, what information is missing and how can you integrate it into the script?
  - Can any technical information be condensed or removed without significantly weakening the story?

**If the world is nonrealistic...**
- Think about how the world of the story differs from the real world.
  - What special rules, if any, enable characters to do things they would not normally be able to do in the real world? State each rule and what it allows.
  - What special rules, if any, limit or prevent characters from doing things they would normally be able to do in the real world? State each rule and the limits it imposes.
  - Do any of these special rules apply to some characters but not to others? If so, whom do these rules affect, whom don’t they affect, and why?
  - What special operating rules, if any, govern time, space, and physical phenomena? State each rule and what it encompasses.
  - When and how is each special operating rule introduced in the story? Is the rule established early enough for the audience to accept it as credible?
  - Are there any special rules that some characters know and others don’t? If so, what is the reason for these differences?

**Rules of the Game 19**
- Are there any special operating rules that come into effect only after the story begins? If so, what empowers these rules and when does this happen?
- Are there any special operating rules that change or end during the story? If so, what causes this development?
- Do any special rules have roots in the backstory that need to be revealed? If so, what happened in the past and how much of this backstory does the audience need to know?
- How do most characters in the world of the story view its special rules?
- Do these special rules affect who has physical, social, or political power over others? If so, how?
- Would the story work better if the rules of the game were different? If so, what rules would you add, change, or eliminate and how would that affect the story?
