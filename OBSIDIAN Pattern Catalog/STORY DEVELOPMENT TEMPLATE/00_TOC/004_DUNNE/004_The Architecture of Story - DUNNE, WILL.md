## style: how characters and events are depicted 

- ### Definition of Style:
  - Style in theater refers to how characters and events are portrayed in the writing and staging of a play. It includes elements like sets, props, costumes, lighting, sound, and acting.
- ### Realistic Style:
  - This style aims to mirror real life, often without acknowledging the audience. Examples include works by Henrik Ibsen, Lynne Nottage, and David Mamet.
  - Example: 'Night, Mother by Marsha Norman is set in a country home with events unfolding in real-time, emphasizing the illusion of reality.
  - Another Example: Edmond by David Mamet, although aiming for realism, compresses events spanning months into a 90-minute performance.
- ### Nonrealistic Style:
  - Also known as presentational style, this employs devices like exaggeration, symbolism, and distortion to present a reality contrasting the real world. It often reminds the audience they are watching a play. Settings can be strange or otherworldly.
  - Examples include plays by Bertolt Brecht, Eugène Ionesco, and José Rivera.
  - Forms of Nonrealism: Includes magic realism, expressionism, surrealism, romanticism, postmodernism, and more.
  - Example: In Cloud 9 by Caryl Churchill, there are routine occurrences of time shifts and gender bending.
  - Another Example: Samuel Beckett’s Endgame portrays the last days of survivors after an apocalypse in a surreal setting.
- ### Combination of Styles:
  - Some writers, like Arthur Miller in After the Fall, blend both realistic and nonrealistic elements in their plays.
### **Key Idea: The style in theater can be realistic, aiming to mirror everyday life, or nonrealistic, which employs various devices to depict an artificial reality, with some plays combining elements of both.**

### Analyzing Your Story
```


#### **Identify the Style of Your Play**

5. **Research**
   - Is further research needed to elaborate on any unusual or complicated events?

##### If the Style is Nonrealistic...
1. **Characters**
   - Are the characters ordinary or extraordinary individuals in an ordinary or extraordinary world?
   - If characters are extraordinary, review their nonrealistic traits and their significance to the story.
   
2. **Setting**

```








## dramatic focus: main character point of view

  - ### Character Focus:
    - This pertains to whose story is being told in the play. It could be one individual (e.g., Hamlet) or a group (e.g., the Ranevskaya family in "The Cherry Orchard").
  - ### Point of View:
    - This decides how the story will be revealed to the audience. It can be:
      1. **Objective:** Audience observes the external world of characters and draws their own conclusions. It offers a "fly on the wall" perspective.
      2. **Subjective:** Audience accesses the inner world of characters. They hear and see the characters’ thoughts, perceptions, and memories. This might include flashbacks, hallucinations, and inner monologues.
    - The point of view can also dictate the limitations of what the audience sees, determining the scenes, characters, and time frame the audience observes.  
#### **Key Idea: The dramatic focus dictates the central narrative and perspective of a play, guiding how audiences engage with and interpret the story.**


### Doubt: A Parable
  - **Character Focus: Single Protagonist:** 
    - The play revolves around Sister Aloysius, the main character.
  - **Point of View: Objective:** 
    - The audience has a limited objective perspective. While they follow Aloysius's journey, they also see events beyond her experience. For instance, they never see the rectory where Father Flynn has private meetings with students, which raises questions about his actions.
#### **Key Idea: Doubt: A Parable" focuses on Sister Aloysius's journey, but uses objective limitations to highlight themes of doubt and uncertainty.**


### Topdog/Underdog
  - **Character Focus: Dual Protagonist:** 
    - The play equally focuses on the characters Booth and Lincoln.
  - **Point of View: Both Objective and Subjective:** 
    - The audience sees the shared world of Booth and Lincoln but also gains access to their individual thoughts and feelings, emphasizing their complex relationship.
#### **Key Idea: "Topdog/Underdog" is a power struggle between two brothers, and the play utilizes both objective and subjective viewpoints to illuminate their dynamic.**


### The Clean House
  - **Character Focus: Group Protagonist:** 
    - The play centers on three women, Lane, Matilde, and Virginia, each representing different societal roles.
  - **Point of View: Both Objective and Subjective:** 
    - The audience's objective view is mainly restricted to Lane's house, symbolizing achievement and social status. There's also a subjective view, letting the audience into certain characters' internal worlds, but this is selective and limited.
#### **Key Idea: "The Clean House" explores the lives of three distinct women, and their quests for connection and self-discovery, using a mix of objective and subjective storytelling.**


### Technical Considerations
  - **Character's Mind Access:** 
    - In plays, sometimes the audience can see what's happening inside a character's mind, but this access is often limited to specific characters and moments.
  - **Literal Access:** 
    - Even if a play offers a subjective point of view, it doesn't always allow the audience full access to every character's thoughts and imaginations.
#### **Key Idea: Technical choices in playwriting can be used selectively to provide insight into a character's internal world, but full access is often limited to preserve narrative intrigue.**

### Analyzing Your Story
```
Sure, here is a breakdown of the provided text into a list format that you can use to analyze your story:

### Analysis Checklist for Your Story

#### **Dramatic Focus**
1. Define the dramatic focus of your story.

#### **Character Focus**
2. Whose story is it? Identify your protagonist(s).
3. After the protagonist, who is the most important character in the story?
4. Onstage or off, what is the most important relationship between characters? 
5. How do you reveal that importance to the audience?

#### **Point of View**
6. Think about the vantage point from which the audience will observe story events. Is this point of view objective (external), subjective (internal), or a combination of the two?
7. Whether objective or subjective, an unlimited point of view allows the audience to see any combination of characters onstage. A limited point of view requires that a certain character or characters be present for a scene to occur. How broad or narrow is the point of view now? 
8. If limited, who gives the audience access to story events? 
9. Why is that character the best choice for the job?
10. In what locations will the audience be able to observe dramatic action? During what time periods?
11. Does the point of view provide enough access to story events for the audience to understand and participate in what is happening? 
12. If not, how can you expand the point of view, and how would that affect the story?
13. What important parts of the dramatic journey will the audience not be able to see? 
14. Identify any limitations that influence the audience’s experience of the story.
15. Are the limitations in point of view sufficient to generate suspense? If not, what other limitations might be imposed? How would they affect the story?
16. Do any scenes in the script violate the point of view that you have established? If so, how might you either redefine the point of view or change a scene that doesn’t fit it?
17. If we are able to see or hear inside of a character’s mind, whose inner world will we enter?
18. Why that character? 
19. How will his or her inner world be presented dramatically?
```







## rules of the game: how things work in this particular story 

- **Understanding the World:** Writers must grasp the world their characters live in and the basic rules that govern actions and possibilities within that environment.
  - In a realistic story, these rules mimic real-world laws of nature, such as the fact that once something is dead, it can't be brought back to life.
  - Complex or rare dramatic events might require writers to research in order to depict them accurately. For example, understanding the progression of a disease.
- **Nonrealistic Stories:** These tales have unique rules that can differ or add to real-world laws.
  - Such stories might allow for fantastical elements like a man growing animal ears or inanimate objects coming to life.
  - The uniqueness of such worlds can affect characters in both positive and negative ways. 
- **Examples from Plays:**
  - *Doubt:* This is a realistic play that follows real-world rules.
  - *Topdog/Underdog:* Even with unusual story elements, it abides by real-world laws.
  - *The Clean House:* This play, grounded in magic realism, combines the extraordinary with the mundane, showcasing several unique rules.
     - Characters can break the fourth wall, chronological order isn't a necessity, magical events are routine, and objects can possess mystical qualities.

### **Key Idea: Understanding the "rules of the game" in storytelling is essential for crafting a believable narrative, whether set in a realistic or nonrealistic world.**

### Magic Realism in "The Clean House"

**Summary and Clarification:**
- **Magic Realism Defined:** A combination of the fantastical with the ordinary, creating a unique set of storytelling rules.
- **Direct Audience Interaction:** Characters, like Matilde, can directly address the audience.
- **Visualization of Imagination:** The audience can witness a character's imaginative figments, as shown with Matilde's parental imagery.
- **Shared Imagination:** Characters can see figments from another character's mind, like when Matilde sees Lane's imagined scenario.
- **Magical Occurrences:** Unusual, magical events, such as Charles and Ana's surgery scene, are normalized.
- **Flexible Chronology:** Events don't necessarily follow a linear timeline, as observed with Charles and Ana's love story.
- **Merged Timelines:** The past and present can occur simultaneously. An instance is Matilde's retelling of a fight while the audience sees it.
- **Conjoined Locations:** Two distinct places can overlap, like Charles' Alaska journey affecting Lane's living room.
- **Mystical Objects:** Common objects can have extraordinary properties or effects, such as the mystical behavior of apples and spices in the play.
- **Deadly Jokes:** A unique rule where characters can die from laughter after hearing the perfect joke.
#### **Key Idea: The Clean House exemplifies magic realism by blending ordinary events with the fantastical, introducing unique rules that defy conventional storytelling norms.**

### Analyzing Your Story
```
Certainly, here's the structured text formatted in Markdown as a list using the exact text provided:



#### Review how the world of your story works

**If the world is realistic...**
- Its physical operating rules have been set by nature. However, you may need to flesh out specific rules for any natural phenomenon that is rare or complicated.
  - Is additional research necessary to understand any specific character traits or story developments? If so, what topics do you need to address?
  - If technical information is important to the story, how much of it does the audience really need to know in order to understand and believe story events?
  - Where in the script is this technical information stated, who tells it to whom, and what is the “here and now” dramatic reason for doing so? Can any of this information be integrated more seamlessly into the dramatic action? If so, how?
  - Have you included all of the technical facts needed for the audience to understand story events? If not, what information is missing and how can you integrate it into the script?
  - Can any technical information be condensed or removed without significantly weakening the story?

**If the world is nonrealistic...**
- Think about how the world of the story differs from the real world.
  - What special rules, if any, enable characters to do things they would not normally be able to do in the real world? State each rule and what it allows.
  - What special rules, if any, limit or prevent characters from doing things they would normally be able to do in the real world? State each rule and the limits it imposes.
  - Do any of these special rules apply to some characters but not to others? If so, whom do these rules affect, whom don’t they affect, and why?
  - What special operating rules, if any, govern time, space, and physical phenomena? State each rule and what it encompasses.
  - When and how is each special operating rule introduced in the story? Is the rule established early enough for the audience to accept it as credible?
  - Are there any special rules that some characters know and others don’t? If so, what is the reason for these differences?

**Rules of the Game 19**
- Are there any special operating rules that come into effect only after the story begins? If so, what empowers these rules and when does this happen?
- Are there any special operating rules that change or end during the story? If so, what causes this development?
- Do any special rules have roots in the backstory that need to be revealed? If so, what happened in the past and how much of this backstory does the audience need to know?
- How do most characters in the world of the story view its special rules?
- Do these special rules affect who has physical, social, or political power over others? If so, how?
- Would the story work better if the rules of the game were different? If so, what rules would you add, change, or eliminate and how would that affect the story?
```







## framework: act and scene divisions, including French scenes

### Play Structure - Acts and Scenes
- **Basic Divisions:** Plays are divided into acts and scenes, which provide structure and shape.
- **No Fixed Formula:** The number of acts or scenes isn't predetermined; it depends on the complexity of characters, plot, and theme.
- **Act Definition:** An act is a significant unit of action, marked by a major turning point. Acts can encompass various settings and timeframes, ending in another turning point or the story's conclusion.
- **Scene Definition:** A scene, part of an act, is driven by a character's need to achieve an objective. Typically set in one location and unfolding in real-time, it results in a significant story change.
- **French Scene:** These are sub-divisions of scenes marked by the entrance or exit of a major character.
#### **Key Idea: The divisions of acts and scenes in a play serve to structure the narrative, driven by character motivations and major turning points.**



### 'Doubt' Scene Structure
- **Act Structure:** 'Doubt' consists of one act, with its storyline focused on Sister Aloysius's quest against Father Flynn.
- **Scene Breaks:** The one act splits into nine scenes, with breaks necessitated by changes in time or location.
- **French Scenes:** Two scenes further divide into French scenes, allowing different character combinations within the same setting.
#### **Key Idea: In 'Doubt', the structured framework of scenes and French scenes serves to emphasize Sister Aloysius's persistent pursuit against Father Flynn.** 


### 'Topdog/Underdog' Structure
- **Act Structure:** While not explicitly labeled, the story can be divided into two acts based on the narrative's major thematic shifts.
- **Scene Structure:** There are six scenes, divided by time shifts, as the entire action happens in a single location.
- **French Scenes:** These are created by one brother being alone either before the other arrives or after the other departs, and occur in four of the scenes.
#### **Key Idea: In 'Topdog/Underdog', the interplay between the two brothers, both in their shared space and in their individual pursuits, drives the narrative through distinct structural divisions.**


### 'The Clean House' Act Structure
- **Act Structure:** The play consists of two acts, each exploring different emotional territories for the characters.
- **Scene Structure:** Both acts are divided into fourteen scenes, shifting between characters' internal worlds and external settings.
- **French Scenes:** To manage the movement of the five main characters, several scenes are further divided into French scenes.
#### **Key Idea: In 'The Clean House', the dual act structure delves deep into the characters' emotional evolutions, accentuated by internal and external shifts in scenes and French scenes.**


### Technical Considerations in Scene Structuring
- **Purpose of Scene Breaks:** These are essential to move between a character's internal world and the play's external settings or to allow the passage of time.
- **French Scenes:** They allow for dynamic character interactions and can introduce significant plot turns, especially when different character combinations come into play.
#### **Key Idea: Technical decisions in scene structuring, including the use of French scenes, are pivotal for driving the narrative and highlighting characters' inner and outer journeys.**


### Analyzing Your Story
```
## Analyzing Your Story

A dramatic story may unfold in one act, two acts, or more, divided into any number of scenes. For any play...

- Think about the current framework.
  - How many acts does it include?
  - How many scenes are there?

- What is the focus—the main topic or activity—of each act?
- What is the turning point that triggers each act?
- Think about the complexity of your characters and the magnitude of the dramatic journey.
  - Do you have the right number of acts for the story you want to tell?
  - If not, what changes will you make?

- Does each scene center on a main event that changes the world of the characters and moves the dramatic journey forward?
- Too many scenes can make the dramatic action feel choppy.
  - Look at how your play breaks into scenes.
  - How necessary is each break?
  - Can any scenes be combined or eliminated?

- If a scene divides into French scenes, what is the event in each one?
  - How necessary is this smaller event to the whole scene and to the play?

- What is your play’s estimated run time?
  - How does this match the substance and scope of the story?
  - If the play feels too long or too short, what changes will you make?

For a play with more than one act...

- Ideally, the act break occurs after a major turning point, or reversal, in the story.
  - Where in your script is the act break now?
  - Is this the best place for the act break?
    - If so, why?
    - If not, what would work better?

- In general, how does the second act differ from the first?
- How does the third act, if there is one, differ from the second, and so on?

- If two acts feel similar, the turning point at the end of the first act may not have caused a big enough change in the dramatic journey.
  - To create two distinct units of action, can you heighten the impact of this turning point or find another one that is more powerful?

- Will the script play best with or without an intermission between acts, and why?

```







## stage directions: instructions for staging the play

### Stage Directions in Theater

- **Definition and Significance**: Stage directions provide instructions about the play's production. They affect a reader’s understanding of the story and the playwright's impression.
  - These directions range from character descriptions, settings, props, to lighting and sound.
  - They guide actors on movements such as entering or exiting scenes, and sometimes contain specific notes about roles.
  
- **Varied Usage Across Plays**: Different plays use stage directions to varying extents.
  - Ibsen uses a crucial stage direction in "A Doll’s House" when Nora leaves her family.
  - Shakespeare's "Hamlet" has minimal directions, while Eugene O’Neill's "Long Day’s Journey into Night" has extensive descriptions.
  
- **Influence of Time Period**: The time when a playwright lived can shape how they use stage directions. Modern theatre tends to favor fewer instructions about staging or actor guidance.
  
- **Not for Audience Consumption**: Stage directions are purely instructive. They are not read aloud and need not be literary or entertaining, except when stylistically required.
  
- **Focus on Essentials**: Stage directions are most effective when they focus on key physical elements and leave broader interpretation (like blocking) to the director.

- **Examples from "Doubt: a parable"**:
  - Scene introductions are concise, providing vital setting and character details.
  - Physical actions are highlighted for storytelling, not just for blocking.
  - Emotions are implied but don't dictate line delivery.
  - Breaks in dialogue are often noted.
  - Typography might hint at dialogue delivery methods.
  - Technical effects include lighting and sound cues.
  - Occasionally, the playwright might insert special commentary.
#### **Key Idea: Stage directions serve as critical blueprints for a play’s production, guiding elements from character behavior to technical cues, and their use varies widely depending on the playwright and the era. **



### Doubt: a parable's Use of Stage Directions

- **Scene Introductions**: Most scenes start with concise directions. For instance, scene 2 introduces a setting, a main character (Aloysius), and her ongoing action.
  
- **Physical Action Emphasis**: Directions highlight significant movements, like in scene 7 where Father Flynn's uneasy pat on Sister James indicates the tension.
  
- **Hinted Emotional Life**: Emotions are implied but not explicitly detailed. After a tense meeting in scene 8, it's noted that “Sister Aloysius is shaken.”
  
- **Breaks in Dialogue**: Shanley, the playwright, uses different means to indicate pauses or breaks, from simple "pause" notations to more descriptive actions.
  
- **Dialogue Delivery Indicators**: Typography is sometimes employed to hint at how lines should be delivered, like italics for emphasis or ellipses for pauses.
  
- **Technical Effects Noted**: The play includes specific lighting shifts and sound cues, such as the "crossfade" between scenes or the ominous crow's caw in scene 7.
  
- **Occasional Commentary**: Shanley sometimes includes notes about character motives or reactions, as seen when Sister James tries to ease tension in scene 5.
#### **Key Idea: In "Doubt: a parable", stage directions go beyond mere logistical guidance, providing insights into characters' emotions, pivotal actions, and the play's overall mood and pacing.


### Topdog/Underdog Stage Directions

  - **Setting Description**: The play mostly takes place in a seedily furnished rooming house room, with the setting primarily described in scene 1 and scene 5.
    - Scene 1 briefly describes the room, highlighting a three-card monte setup, with Booth practicing card hustling.
    - Scene 5 transforms the room into a romantic setting for a dinner date.
  - **Physical Action**: Stage directions are utilized to show characters' movements, such as entrances, exits, and significant actions like Lincoln's assassination rehearsal.
  - **Emotional Life**: A character's emotional state is often implied by their physical actions rather than directly stated. For example, Booth's alarm is inferred when he pulls a gun.
  - **Breaks in Dialogue**: Unique terms like “Rest” indicate a short pause, and a repeated character's name indicates a longer break.
  - **Dialogue Delivery**: The playwright uses various typographical cues to suggest how lines should be delivered, including spelling for dialect, dashes for pauses, and hyphenation.
  - **Technical Effects**: Minimal use of special effects, with only a few lighting and sound cues, like the implied gunshot in scene 6.
  - **Commentary**: Brackets are used in the play to suggest optional lines that directors might choose to exclude from a production.
#### **Key Idea: In "Topdog/Underdog", the stage directions guide the emotional and physical journey of the characters, intertwining minimalistic settings with the complexities of dialogue delivery.**


### The Clean House Stage Directions

  - **Setting Description**: Much of the action is set in Lane's living room, with changes indicated only when significant, like its transformation into a hospital.
  - **Physical Action**: Stage directions often highlight characters' actions, ranging from significant events to minor actions reflecting character or mood.
  - **Emotional Life**: While some directions explicitly describe a character's emotions, most of the emotional life is implied through actions and dialogues.
  - **Breaks in Dialogue**: Pauses or silences in dialogues are typically implied by physical actions or one character "looking at" another.
  - **Dialogue Delivery**: Instructions on how to deliver lines are rare but are sometimes provided. The delivery is mainly inferred through typography.
  - **Technical Effects**: There are occasional suggestions for lighting, sound, and special effects, like snowfall or projected subtitles.
  - **Commentary**: The playwright often adds unique comments, staging suggestions, and questions, showcasing her distinct voice throughout the stage directions.
#### **Key Idea: In "The Clean House", the stage directions, often poetic in nature, not only depict the physical and emotional landscape of the play but also communicate the playwright's personal touch and whimsical vision.**

# Analyzing Your Use of Stage Directions

For each scene in your script, consider the following:

- Do the opening stage directions identify where and when the scene takes place?
  - Have you described only what matters most about this place at this time?

- Do the opening directions identify who is present now and what they are doing?

- During the scene, have you clearly indicated when characters enter and exit?

- Do you need to add or remove any information about costumes or props?

- Are there any critical physical directions during the scene, such as "He takes out a gun," that need to be added? Are there any unnecessary directions that can be eliminated?

- If a direction tells an actor how to say a line, for example, "Nervously," can you render it unnecessary by strengthening the dialogue?

- If you tell actors when to pause during the dialogue, are you doing so judiciously? Are there specified dialogue breaks that can be eliminated?

- Think about your general use of typographical elements in dialogue, such as italics, dashes, ellipses, exclamation points, and capitalization. Do these elements strengthen the dialogue by clarifying or heightening it, or do they weaken the dialogue by taking the place of effective word choices or by cluttering the lines with too many intrusions?

- Do you need to add directions related to lighting, sound, or special effects? Could any now present be deleted?

- Do you need to add any directions to clarify what is happening in a scene?

- Have you removed any directions that are not essential to the dramatic action and would be better left to the director, actors, and designers as they work on your script?

- Consider the impact of stage directions at the end of each scene, if any, and how they contribute to the overall effect.

## offstage population: who influences the story from offstage

### Offstage Population in Dramatic Stories
- **Definition**: The offstage population refers to characters in a dramatic story who exist but are not directly seen or interacted with on stage.
- **Purpose**: Some characters are kept offstage due to their minimal significance, while others have a more powerful impact when absent. Their influence is based on how they affect the main narrative.
- **Examples**: Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" has Godot as a central character who remains offstage, making his absence a pivotal aspect of the play. Other examples include characters from plays like "Other Desert Cities," "Faith Healer," "The Dumb Waiter," and "American Buffalo."
#### **Key Idea: Offstage characters can have a significant impact on the story's direction, tone, and themes, even if they never appear on stage.**


### Doubt: A Parable
- **Setting and Background**: The offstage characters are primarily students and staff of St. Nicholas church and school.
- **Minor Characters**: Names like William London, Donald Muller, and others are mentioned to establish the setting of a bustling school.
- **Major Offstage Characters**: 
  - **Donald Muller**: His experiences form the core conflict in the play, catalyzing Aloysius's suspicions against Father Flynn.
  - **William London**: His interactions form an introduction to Aloysius's suspicious nature.
  - **Mr. McGinn**: His accounts form a part of the uncertainty surrounding Flynn's actions.
  - **Monsignor Benedict**: Represents the absence of reliable authority in the Church.
  - **Sister Veronica**: Provides a view of Aloysius's protective side.
#### **Key Idea: While the visible characters drive the dialogue and immediate action, it's the offstage population that shapes the core conflict and reveals deeper character traits.**



### Topdog/Underdog
- **Parents (Moms and Pops)**: Their past actions, including favoritism and abrupt departures, lay the foundation for the existing rivalry between the brothers, Lincoln and Booth.
- **Grace**: Booth's former girlfriend who has an elevated presence in Booth's life and decisions.
- **Others**: Include Cookie, Lonny, and Lincoln's Best Customer who provide context to the main characters' past and present behaviors.
#### **Key Idea: Family dynamics and past experiences heavily influence the present actions and relationships of the main characters in the story.**




### The Clean House
- **Matilde’s Parents**: Presented as figments of Matilde's imagination, they symbolize her intense grief and longing for a happier past.
- **Virginia's Husband**: Represents Virginia's sense of settling for less and her desire for deeper connections.
- **Ana's Husband**: Offers insight into Ana's past and helps understand her current attractions and decisions.

**Key Idea: Even when characters aren't present, their memories, influence, and past relationships play a critical role in shaping the narrative and the motivations of the main characters.**

## plot: synopsis and chain of events

### Understanding Story and Plot:
  - **Definition Differentiation:** The passage mentions that story refers to what happens in the life of a character while plot is how and why these events occur, in an organized manner to demonstrate their connection.
  - **Illustration through David Mamet’s Edmond:** The story is a man leaving his wife while the plot is built around a fortune-teller's warning which spirals events leading to the man’s departure from his marital home.
  - **Event Organization:** Events are normally arranged in a chronological order but exceptions like non-linear structures are noted, using examples from other plays by Tom Stoppard and Harold Pinter.
  - **Event Significance:** Each event in a plot should be essential and connected to other events, with each acting as a result of a preceding event and/or a trigger for subsequent events, forming a cause-and-effect chain.
  - **Scene Composition:** A scene typically sums up to one main event, although it might contain other smaller events, and each scene contributes towards advancing the plot, ensuring a smooth transition.
#### **Key Idea: The plot is an organized presentation of events illustrating cause and effect, deriving from the broader story which simply portrays what happens in a character's life.**



### Analysis of Plot in "Doubt: A Parable":
  - **Central Conflict:** The story revolves around Sister Aloysius suspecting Father Flynn of inappropriate behavior with a student, and her journey to prove his guilt despite lacking concrete evidence.
  - **Event Chain:** The passage illustrates a tightly interlinked sequence of events where each event either directly causes or is influenced by the preceding or subsequent events, displaying a clear cause-effect relationship.
  - **Scene 3's Unique Function:** Scene 3, although not directly tied to the main event chain, provides significant character information affecting audience perception of events.

#### **Key Idea: The plot in "Doubt: A Parable" meticulously unravels through a cause-effect chain, reflecting the central conflict of suspicion and moral certainty amidst the characters’ actions and decisions.**

**Specifics from "Doubt: A Parable"**: The play is set in Saint Nicholas, a Catholic church and school in the Bronx, 1964. Settings within the play include the pulpit, principal's office, school gym, and a garden.
  - These settings are isolated, creating a confined, self-contained arena for the drama. Time-specific references and objects like clothing or physical attributes of characters can advance the narrative.
  - For example, Aloysius and James' attire signifies their dedication to the Church, while Flynn's clothing, whether liturgical vestments or casual wear, provides insight into his character and position within the Church hierarchy.
  - Everyday objects like pens, notebooks, and even a bowl of sugar can reveal aspects of character relationships and power dynamics, as seen in Aloysius's interactions with Flynn.
  - Natural elements, like the wind or the caw of a crow, can set the mood or foreshadow upcoming events.
#### **Key Idea: The physical realm in storytelling, encompassing setting and tangible elements, plays a crucial role in grounding characters, driving the narrative, and deeply immersing audiences into the world of the characters.**

## laws and customs: social rules that affect behavior

### The Clean House: Broad Social Context
- **Housecleaning as a Metaphor for Gender**: The Clean House uses housecleaning as a metaphor, drawing parallels to the roles of women in society. Housework is seen as an "invisible labor," traditionally associated with women, as it doesn't produce tangible products but only a temporary absence of mess.
- **Historical Perspectives on Gendered Labor**: The 1970s view of women, as outlined by feminist Germaine Greer, emphasized that women were unpaid and oppressed workers, much like slaves, for their endless contributions to household tasks.
- **Modern Statistics on Gendered Labor**: According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 49% of women partake in daily housework versus 19% of men. Men who do house chores tend to handle tasks traditionally associated with their gender, like yard work.
- **Professional Housekeepers**: Most housekeepers are women, especially women of color. They face low incomes, no benefits, and a lack of legal protections. The pay often falls below the state's minimum wage.
#### **Key Idea: The broad social context of "The Clean House" hinges on the metaphor of housecleaning, emphasizing the undervalued labor of women, both historically and in contemporary times, underscoring issues of gender, ethnicity, and class.**

- **Class, Ambitions, and Isolation**: Matilde, despite her aspirations of being a comedian, finds herself constrained due to her socioeconomic class and personal circumstances.
#### **Key Idea: The immediate social dynamics of "The Clean House" spotlight the chasms between classes, career aspirations, and societal roles, influencing relationships and personal decisions.**




### The Clean House: Prevailing Values and Beliefs
- **Perfection as a Goal**: Every character in the play is striving for some form of perfection, whether it's a spotless house, an ideal family, the ultimate joke, or a soulmate.
- **Complexities of Love**: Love, in its various forms, drives the narrative. It's responsible for joy, conflict, pain, and growth among the characters. Love is revered but often leads to unrealistic expectations.
- **Love and Perfection**: Both these core values are intertwined, and characters must reconcile their yearnings for ideal scenarios with the messy realities of life and love.
#### **Key Idea: In "The Clean House," the characters' pursuit of perfection and love underscores the narrative, revealing that acceptance of life's imperfections is key to personal growth and fulfillment.**

## Point of Attack: how the play begins

### Point of Attack in Plays
  **Definition of a Play:** A play is a segment of a dramatic story shown to the audience, representing a feasible selection of events and characters to be staged within a given timeframe.
    - A playwriter decides which elements of a story to showcase in the play.

  **Starting Point of a Play:** A play cannot start at the very beginning of a story, implying that some part of the story is already in progress.
    - The "point of attack" defines when the play starts in relation to the story.
    - Examples include "Rabbit Hole," where the play starts eight months after a tragic incident; "Macbeth," which begins just before the protagonist's ambition is ignited; and "August: Osage County," where the play starts long after foundational events have occurred.

  **Importance of Point of Attack:** This decision is crucial for storytelling.
    - If it's early in the story, there's less need for background information.
    - If it's later, there's a higher reliance on exposition or information about prior events.

  **Given Circumstances:** Every point of attack is influenced by specific conditions or events leading up to it. 
    - The play ideally begins when something critical is unfolding in the story.
#### **Key Idea: The "point of attack" is an essential concept in playwriting, determining where the play begins in relation to the overall story, influencing how much exposition or background information is required for audience understanding.**

   - **Forms of Conflict**: Conflict may stem from internal sources, like personal grief; from other characters with opposing needs; or from external societal situations.
   - **Examples**: In "God's Ear," a mother's inner grief is the conflict, while in "The Piano Lesson," conflicting desires over a family heirloom drive the story. In "Angels in America," societal rejection due to sexual identity and medical condition forms the conflict.
   - **Central Conflict**: The primary, most challenging obstacle faced by the character, usually introduced early and resolved by the end, revealing the character’s quest and its importance.
  
### **Key Idea: The essence of drama revolves around characters facing and attempting to overcome conflicts, which arise from various internal, interpersonal, or external sources, illuminating the characters’ quests.**


### Central Conflict in "Doubt: A Parable"
   - **Primary Antagonist**: Flynn is the main obstacle for Aloysius who suspects him of child abuse, and aims to protect the students.

## What's at Stake: The Protagonist's Reason to Act

### What's at Stake in Stories
- **Objective and Motivation:** Characters in stories have objectives, which are things they want. Their motivations are the reasons they want these things, which can be determined by the potential gains or losses from their quests.
- **Behavior and Motive:** Every action a character takes is driven by a motive. Whether logical or illogical, there is always a reason behind a character's behavior.
- **Compelling Reason:** For a story's central quest, the character needs a powerful reason to continue. Without high stakes, actions can appear unbelievable or melodramatic.

```
## Analyzing Your Story

Explore the motivation of the main character to complete the quest.

### Warm-Up

- Define your main character’s quest, or superobjective.

### Potential Gain or Loss

- What will your character gain if the quest succeeds? What will be lost if it fails?

- Will any group—such as the character’s family, friends, co-workers, or community—also be affected by the quest? If so, who? What would they gain or lose?
- Think about the greatest good that will be achieved if the quest succeeds or the greatest loss that will be suffered if it fails. What is the highest stake hanging in the balance?
- Are the stakes high enough to prevent your character from compromising or giving up the quest when it becomes challenging? If not, can you raise the stakes by:
  - Making the potential gain greater?
  - Making the potential loss worse?
  - Broadening the potential impact of the quest—for example, by increasing the number of people who will be affected by its outcome?

### Motivation

- Dramatic characters tend to be noble in some way. What is your character’s noblest reason for wanting to complete the quest?
- When your character launches the quest, does he or she have any misperceptions about what is really at stake? If so, how does this affect the story?
- Does your character’s motivation to complete the quest stem from any backstory experience, positive or negative, and, if so, what?
- Does your character have any selfish, base, or cowardly reason for wanting to complete the quest, and, if so, what?
- What does your character’s motivation suggest about his or her values and beliefs?
- Sometimes characters are unaware of their true motivations for taking action. Does your character have any subconscious reason to pursue this goal, and, if so, what?

## Analyzing Your Story

Explore the most difficult decision your main character(s) must make.

### Crisis Decision

- Ideally, the crisis decision occurs near the end of the story. Where in the script does your character’s most difficult decision occur? Does it need to happen later?
- Where and when in the world of the characters does this crisis occur? How does this place and time affect the crisis?
- Who else, if anyone, is here now? How does their presence affect the crisis?
- What specific alternatives are available to your character?
- Is this a choice primarily between two goods or two evils?
- If it is a choice between goods: Why can’t the character have both? What makes these goods irreconcilable?
- If it is a choice between evils: Why can’t they both be eliminated? How does eliminating one enable the other?
- From your character’s perspective, right or wrong, what are the most compelling reasons to choose each alternative? To not choose it?

### Making the Choice

- Which alternative does your character choose?
- How easy is this choice from your character’s perspective?
- How predictable is this choice from the audience’s perspective?
- If the crisis decision is too easy or too predictable, there is no suspense surrounding it. What changes in the character, the story, or the decision itself would make the choice more difficult for the character or less predictable for the audience?
- What does this choice reveal about your character?
- How has your character changed since the quest began?
- In what important ways has your character not changed?

### Analyzing Your Story 
```
## Analyzing Your Story

With your main character(s) in mind, explore the climax and resolution of your story.

### Climax

- Where and when in the world of the story does the climax occur? Who is involved?
- What does each character want here and now? Are these the right objectives for these characters at this time in the story? If not, how would you change the objectives?
- What obstacles does each character face here and now? Are there any opportunities to increase the conflict? If so, how?
- What is at stake for each character? Is it possible to raise the stakes? If so, how?
- What happens during the climactic action?
- Does this event feel like the peak of action in the play? If not, how can you change the story to make this event more intense or a previous event less intense?
- How does the climax affect each character physically? Psychologically? Socially?

### Climax and Resolution

- What does the climax reveal about each of the characters involved?
- Has your main character succeeded or failed to achieve his or her goal, and why?

### Resolution

- Think about what has been resolved and not resolved as a result of the climactic action. What else, if anything, should happen before the play concludes?
- If any loose ends need to be tied up, have you focused only on what matters most?
- Where and when in the world of the story does this resolution occur? Who is involved?
- How does each character feel as the story draws to a close?
- Can you make better use of imagery to reduce the need for explanation? If so, how?
- What thoughts and feelings do you want the audience to experience as the play ends?
- Everything after the climax is literally “anticlimactic.” Can the story end sooner without sacrificing something important? If so, what would the new ending be?
