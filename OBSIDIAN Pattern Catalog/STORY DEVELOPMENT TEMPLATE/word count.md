In 1980 literary discussion in the United States was dominated by debates over theory, especially over the status of language, as scholars questioned its referential value and its power to construct or undo meaning. A group of younger critics, several of them at the University of California at Berkeley, were instead turning their attention to the concrete particularities of history. But rather than simply amassing facts, as did traditional literary historians, they used more creative methods, most notably drawing on anecdotes, to illuminate the context of literature. A leading member of that group was Stephen J. Greenblatt, who coined the term “the new historicism” to describe the kind of literary history that he and his colleagues were writing, and who has become the leading critic of Shakespeare of his generation. In our selection, from his essay “Resonance and Wonder” (1990), he explains his sense of literary history, which accounts for the aesthetic wonder that texts arouse as well as their historical resonance. Born in the Boston area, Greenblatt is the son of a lawyer and grandson of Lithuanian immigrants, as he recounts in some of his essays. He received his B.A. in 1964 from Yale University, where his undergraduate thesis on modern British novelists won a Yale College award and was published in 1965, and where he earned his Ph.D. in 1969. In between undergraduate and graduate work, he spent two years at Cambridge University in England, attending lectures with raymond Williams and developing his interest in Renaissance literature. He taught at the University of California at Berkeley from 1969 to 1997; he then moved to Harvard University, where he holds a University Professorship of the Humanities. Among his many honors, he served as president of the Modern Language Association in 2002. Building from his studies of Renaissance literature, he has become a prominent public figure in the humanities, serving as general editor of The Norton Shakespeare (1997; 3d ed., 2015) and writing the popular biographical study Will in the World (2004), which was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize; taking over the editorship of the major college textbook in English, The Norton Anthology of English Literature, in 1999; and lecturing around the globe. The dominant mode of criticism in the United States when Greenblatt was in college was the New Criticism, and in fact several influential New Critics were at Yale, notably cleanth brooks and william k. wimsatt jr. They were formalists, holding that literary criticism should attend only to the “verbal icon” and its internal features, and ruling out attention to the work’s author, audience, or context. Three Yale Ph.D. students eventually gained fame by turning those formalist prohibitions on their head. In the face of the “intentional fallacy,” harold bloom focused on the author and his psychic struggle with his predecessors to establish himself in the great tradition. In the face of the “affective fallacy,” stanley fish posited that meaning was not in the poem but in the reader. And in the face of bans against considering external matter, Greenblatt focused on both the biographical and historical circumstances surrounding literary works. While not avoiding aesthetic analysis, he showed how history enhanced the interpretation of, for instance, a Shakespeare play. In a famous chapter in Shakespearean Negotiations (1988), he tells the story of a trial of a transvestite in France during the Renaissance as a way to explain some of the dilemmas of marriage and gender in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night (1601). Though he named the New Historicism, Greenblatt has been less invested in elaborating a theoretical program than in practical criticism. Still, he has assimilated a variety of theoretical positions along the way. He remarks that studying at Cambridge, especially with Raymond Williams, opened his eyes to the social aspects of literature. But he did not become a Marxist, as Williams was, and he also drew from michel foucault and from cultural anthropology. Like Foucault’s Discipline and Punish (1975; see above), which starts its examination of the way that modern society exerts control through subtle discipline rather than overt force with a striking story of an execution, Greenblatt’s analyses often begin with an anecdote, unusual detail, or incidental object, like Cardinal Wolsey’s cap in “Resonance and Wonder.” From Foucault he and many of the New Historicists developed the idea that modern society operates through “subversion and containment”—that is, while it seems that some practices subvert discipline, such resistance is regularly incorporated back into the system. For instance, we might protest an unjust action of our government, but our act of protesting affirms that we have a free society, and therefore reinforces society’s overall control rather than disturbing it. From anthropologists, Greenblatt takes ideas of the circulation and exchange of cultural practices, which he uses in showing how a play might represent the dynamics of gender. Greenblatt also is a fellow traveler of poststructuralists, holding that history is textual, constructed, and self-contradictory rather than offering a record of events as they actually happened, as he notes in our selection. We “know” the reign of Henry VIII only through Shakespeare’s plays and other texts, and through artifacts like Wolsey’s hat. In “Resonance and Wonder,” Greenblatt defines the New Historicism as “an interest . . . in the embeddedness of cultural objects in the contingencies of history.” While usually less interested in elaborating a theory than in bringing past texts to life, in this essay Greenblatt programmatically reflects on his position. His stress on history departs from the New Criticism as well as from more recent modes of criticism, like deconstruction, that concentrate on the linguistic attributes of literature. The main target of “Resonance and Wonder,” though, is traditional historicism, and he rebuts three standard views. By stressing contingency, Greenblatt distances himself from more deterministic views, such as Marxism, which hold that history follows a teleological path rooted in class struggle. He also counters the idea of scholarly objectivity, the notion that one merely reports facts; rather, New Historicists see their work as interested and aim to intervene in cultural debates—for instance, to dispel rigid, normative ideas of gender. His third attack is on the veneration of history as stable and coherent fact. As he remarks, New Historicists are “as concerned with the margins as with the center,” examining the contradictions and conflicts as well as the resolutions. Though Greenblatt is known for revivifying the study of history, one key that undergirds “Resonance and Wonder” and his work overall is his interest in the literary. While his stress on “resonance” reminds us that literary works are not icons but historical objects spun from a web of cultural practices, his stress on “wonder” forestalls the reduction of a work to its historical context. Rather, it reaffirms the uniqueness of the literary object, through its aesthetic power “to stop the viewer in his tracks.” In this regard, Greenblatt represents a revival of literary criticism and aesthetic appreciation over theory; often overlooked is the influence on his work of erich auerbach, who studied literary masterpieces across Western culture in his classic Mimesis (1953; see above). Auerbach opens each chapter with a brief quotation from a literary work, from which he builds his arguments about the shift in cultural representation over two thousand years. As Greenblatt discusses in Practicing New Historicism (2000), anecdotes play a similar role for him. They sometimes seem random, but from them Greenblatt builds a sense of an era. Greenblatt’s anecdotes try to effect what he has called “the touch of the real,” re-creating the social and cultural negotiations of a historical moment. Although Greenblatt has largely avoided theoretical battles, his work has been criticized on various grounds. Traditionalists appreciate his high valuation of literature, but feel he brings extraneous material into the field. More radical critics, often from the Marxist side, have attacked him for not taking a strong political stand and for having a vague sense of historical causality; he often juxtaposes objects or events that lack a verifiable historical connection—for example, a trial in France and an English play. Ironically, it is probably because he takes a nonpolemical stance, and maintains the importance of literature, that Greenblatt has become a leading representative of literary studies and the world’s leading commentator on Shakespeare. “Resonance and Wonder” Keywords: Aesthetics, The Canon/Tradition, Drama, Formalism, Literary History, Marxism, New Historicism, Poststructuralism
