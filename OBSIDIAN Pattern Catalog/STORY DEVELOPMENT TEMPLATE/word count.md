Therefore, I firmly conclude that poetry is a sophistic art and that through imitation, which is its proper genus, and the credible, which is its subject, and through delight, which is its end, when it is under that genus, and has that subject, and gains that end, it is many times forced to find room for the false. And although I have only cited Philostratus, Plato, and Plutarch on this point, a thousand others could be found whom I have left in the wings so as not to be too long. And so the credible is the subject of poetry. But because it is also the subject of rhetoric we must necessarily see in what way it can be made to On the D efense of the “ Comedy” of D ante / 24 9. The “predicaments” or predicables make up Aristotle’s Categories. They are substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, and affection [translator’s note]. 1. Roman rhetorician (ca. 61–ca. 112 c.e.), nephew of the natural historian Pliny the Elder. Among his correspondents on literary subjects was Caninius Rufus, of whom little else is known. 2. Roman emperor, 98–117 c.e. (b. 53); he successfully conquered Dacia (roughly equivalent to modern Romania) in 105. 3. Pliny the Younger, Letters, book 8, letter 4. The reference to a natural marvel is in book 9, letter 33 [translator’s note]. 4. A Greek elegiac poet of Megara (active ca. 540 b.c.e.), known for his large fragmentary collection of gnomic verses. Parmenides (b. ca. 515 b.c.e.), Greek didactic poet and philosopher known for his On Nature, which contains the earliest Greek discussion of philosophical method. Nicander (2d c. b.c.e.), Greek poet and grammarian. 5. Plutarch, “How a Young Man Should Study Poetry,” Moralia, Loeb ed., vol. 1, pp. 83–85 [translator’s note]. become proper to both poetry and rhetoric, since we will not fall into the error of those who accept the verisimilar false. [61] I say therefore that the credible insofar as it is credible is the subject of rhetoric and the credible insofar as it is marvelous is the subject of poetry, for poetry must not only utter credible things but also marvelous things. And for this reason when it can do so credibly, it falsifies human and natural history and passes beyond them to impossible things, as I prove in the sixth chapter of the third book and in the others following, in which a full digression treats this material. So that, if two things equally credible were offered to the poet, one of them more marvelous than the other, though false, not just impossible, the poet ought to take it and refuse the other. And if anyone wants examples, let him read the abovementioned digression, in which, I am convinced, he will find many to the point in each of Aristotle’s ten predicaments.9 But perhaps there is someone who might wonder why the credible marvelous is not found in company with the true. And he might also suppose that what was said before—that poetry sometimes admits the true—is wrong. I respond that sometimes true things are found in poetry which are often more marvelous than the false, not only in natural things, as Pliny the Younger1 has shown in the eighth book of his Letters when he writes to Caninius Rufus, but also in human history, as that same Pliny has shown in the ninth book, writing to the same Caninius. [62] In the latter he explains that the war made on Dacia by the Emperor Trajan,2 although true, was nevertheless a worthy subject for a poem because it was marvelous. Here are his words: “I greatly approve your plan of writing a poem on the Dacian war, for where could you have found a subject so fresh, so eventful, so broad, and, in short, so poetical; a subject which, although most true, is also marvelous. You will write of rivers turned into new channels, of bridges thrust across rivers for the first time, of camps pitched on precipitous mountains.”3 See how well Pliny demonstrates that the true can sometimes reach the marvelous. Concerning this topic there only remains to discuss that authority by which it seems to be proven that the false, insofar as it is verisimilar, is a poetic subject. I mention first of all that it is the case that Aristotle calls Empedocles more a physicist than a poet, and this is confirmed by Plutarch in the essay on understanding poems cited above: “I do not know of poetry without fable or fiction. For the verses of Empedocles and of Parmenides, the Theriaca of Nicander, and the sayings of Theognis4 are more often than not sermons, so that as a vehicle to cast off the baseness of prose, I prefer the grandeur and measure of poetry.”5 Now as for the authority of Aristotle, we can respond to it in two ways, the first of which is that he has said that Empedocles is more often a physicist than a poet, but he has not by that statement said absolutely 250 / G IACOPO MAZZON 6. Poet of Greek New Comedy (active 270 b.c.e.). 7. Apparently a somewhat inaccurate reference to Phaedo 61b. that he is not a poet, so that affirming that he is more of a physicist than a poet, he has in some way said that he is a poet, since the grammarians tell us that the comparative assumes the positive.

The second way of answering Aristotle is that it could be said (as it was said above) that Empedocles did not merit the name of poet, not because he dealt with true things, for it has already been shown that poetry is able sometimes to treat the true; but because he dealt with things belonging to the sciences scientifically, when he was obligated as a poet to treat them credibly, that is, forming idols and images, matching his mode of instruction more often to the sensitive than to the intellectual powers. As for Plutarch, I say that either he is really speaking of the true and perfect poet, who (as it is said) ought more often to be placed under phantastic imitation, rather than icastic imitation, or his opinion is in opposition to that of Aristotle and Plato, that is, that poetry cannot in any fashion be made from the true. And this answer ought to suffice for the authority of Plutarch, which has been cited to the contrary. [63] To Aristotle’s text where he writes that the history of Herodotus laid out in verse would still be history, and so not worthy of the name of poetry, I respond that it is true, but that it does not follow from this that one cannot in some way make a poem out of history, when it is represented as the credible marvelous in idols and particularized images. But if it were narrated in the mode appropriate to history, without making idols and images, even if it were laid out in verse, it would always remain history. And this was what Aristotle meant at that place [in the Poetics]. To the authority of Euphron,6 I respond that the true can also be sweetened by narrating it in conformity with the credible, using idols and images. For this reason I believe that icastic poetry, which takes a true subject from history, may nevertheless combine some things of its own in order to render that history more particularized. This is no doubt even more clearly evident in the dramatic-icastic than in the narrative-icastic. As for the authority of Plato in the Phaedo, I say that he discussed phantastic poetry which always takes a fabulous subject, either forming one totally feigned or falsifying a true story. And for this reason he says in that place [the Phaedo] that the poet deserves his name more often for his inventing of fables than for his inventing of verses.7 Or one might say that he takes the fable in the sense of every invention that can be suitable to the poem and names it fable, because for him such subjects are false and fabulous. [64] But it should not for this reason be said that he did not believe that the true could be a poetic subject, since in an infinite number of other places he says just the contrary, as has already been shown. Therefore let us summarize what has been said on the poetic subject, that it ought to be credible and at the same time marvelous, and then joining this subject to the form already disclosed above, we can now say that poetry is an imitation made with harmony, rhythm, and verses, singly or together, of things credible and marvelous. There remains for the completion of this definition that we find the efficient and final causes of poetry. Now as for the efficient cause, we might On the D efense of the “ Comedy” of D ante / 25

8. By the civil faculty Mazzoni means, roughly speaking, ethics, or the mode of discourse that decides the social relevance of something [translator’s note]. 9. Both Greek terms can denote rest and repose, but the first (anapausis) suggests leisure and relaxation while the second (schole) implies idleness. 1. Nicomachean Ethics 10.3; Politics 8 generally concerns education and leisure. The sixth chapter of the second book would seem more to Mazzoni’s point than the fifth, which deals with a number of topics ranging from the justice system to political innovation [translator’s note]. dispatch it by saying that it is the human intellect. But this is a cause common to all the other arts, and we only wish to find one that is more appropriate to poetry and that, joined to its end, will reveal the proper origin and legitimate use of poetry. Therefore in order to lay the foundation for this, I believe there is no surer way than to consider what that art is that discovers the use of poetry, because that, unless I deceive myself, will reveal the origin and the end of poetry. I think, then, that the civil faculty8 is that which discovers not only the use of poetry but also explains the norm and the rules for the poetic idol. The following consideration presses me toward this belief, namely, that all the natural powers and the arts that are born of human reason are usually directed to contrary objects, as for example medicine, which not only deals with health and healthful potions but also with sickness and poisons. We can say also that the legal profession likewise not only professes to deal with justice but with injustice as well.  6. Poet of Greek New Comedy (active 270 b.c.e.). 7. Apparently a somewhat inaccurate reference to Phaedo 61b.

Now keeping this in mind, I say that the civil faculty not only professes to understand the justness of human actions but also the justness of the cessation of human actions, a justness that is opposed to the first justness as deprivation is opposed to habit. * * * [65] But the cessation of a process, as will be explained a little further on, must dispose and prepare men so that they are more apt and eager for the process. Therefore the same faculty will provide the rule for the activity and its cessation. [66] And note that I do not take cessation to be total privation or extinction or activity, but only cessation of serious and difficult activities, and so in the word cessation we include the activities of play and amusement which we do for recreation and entertainment. So it can be said that the contrariety of function and cessation is not only privation but (as was said above) also positive. It is privation insofar as the cessation indicates the absence of serious work. It is positive insofar as the cessation of serious work might contain some pleasant activity apt to restore the spirits fatigued by the more important function. This is clearly enough indicated by Aristotle in the tenth book of the Ethics and the eighth of the Politics, where discussing cessation (which he treats at length in the fifth chapter of the second book), the name is always νπαυσις and not σχολ9 to make it clear that he does not take the otium that is the father of all vices as entertainment or the cessation of serious things, but rather some peaceful and gentle activity.1 So it appears to me that one can firmly say that in order for cessation to be the opposite of the privative and positive activity, it must necessarily be the concern of one art and a single faculty. But the civil faculty is that which considers the rightness of an activity, so it should also consider the rightness of its cessation. Within it, as I have said, are contained all the activities of amusement, that is, those performed in games. Therefore the consideration of the rightness of pleasure will without any doubt be pertinent in some way to the civil faculty and to moral philosophy. But among all games none is 252 / G IACOPO MAZZON

2. Greek poet of Middle Comedy (active ca. 330 b.c.e.). Virgil (70–19 b.c.e.), Roman poet. horace (65–8b.c.e. ), Roman lyric poet and satirist. 3. Bishop of Caesarea and historian of the early Christian church (ca. 260–340 c.e.). 4. Aristotle, Politics 7.1334a; Plato, Laws 2.667e [translator’s note]. 5. The latter part of book 7 and all of book 8 discuss liberal education, that is, the education appropriate to a free man. For Aristotle this means not just someone not a slave, but a citizen relieved from the compulsion to labor or earn a living by commerce. The civil faculty at rest or leisure thus concerns itself with contemplation and with the study and appreciation of certain kinds of elevated enjoyment such as music and poetry [translator’s note]. found more worthy, more noble, and more central than what the poets’ work has made. Therefore the civil faculty takes care to consider principally among the other pleasures the standard and rightness of poetry. Now, that the ancients believed that poetry was a game is shown in the abovementioned chapter of the second book on the authority of Virgil, Horace, Timocles2 the comic poet, Plato in the tenth book of the Republic, and in the fifth of the Laws, and Eusebius of Caesarea3 in the twelfth book of the Evangelical Preparations. To these can be added the authority of Aristotle, who in the seventh book of the Politics calls games “the imitations of those things you do seriously.” And there is the authority of Plato who in the second book of the Laws says of poetic imitation: “Again I call it amusement and play.”4 From all these considerations it seems to me that it can be reasonably said that the civil faculty ought to be divided into two principal parts, one of which is concerned with the laws of activities and is given the general name of politics, that is the civil law. [67] The other is concerned with the laws of cessation or the laws of recreational activities, and is called poetics. And on this basis I believe that the Poetics is the ninth book of the Politics, and my view seems to me all the more correct in that I find in the eighth book of the Politics and at the beginning of the first chapter of the Poetics he commences to deal with music, in order to proceed step by step to discuss the recreation of the civil faculty. And so I say that the first seven books of the Politics speak of the civil faculty at work and the last two speak of the civil faculty (so to speak) at rest, a state we have just previously called poetics.5 Therefore poetics is part of the civil faculty and is what prescribes the standards, the rules, and the laws of the idol in poetry. So in a way it can be said that poetics deals with the idea of the idol and poetry with the making of it. Thus poetics will be in its genus the ruling art, using the idol made by poets to that end we have just previously mentioned. And in its genus poetry will be the fabricating art, the maker of the idol, which is then to be used by poetics and by the civil faculty. [68] We can therefore add to the previous words concerning the definition of poetry its efficient cause and say: Poetry is an imitation made with harmony, number, and verses, singly or together, of credible and marvelous things discovered by the civil faculty. Up to this point we have disclosed the form, the subject matter, and the making of poetry, so that it remains only to turn our hand to the discussion of its final cause. Ancient and modern writers have raised a great fuss about this, not knowing very well whether they should take usefulness or delight or both, or neither the one nor the other, as the end of poetry.
