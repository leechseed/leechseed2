### 28. Moby-Dick by Herman Melville - The Inscrutable Sublime and the Whiteness of Moby-Dick

#### Key Idea:
The narrative explores theodicy and the sublime, illustrating a human struggle to comprehend the vast and terrifying unknown, embodied in the White Whale.

#### Summary:
"Moby-Dick" is characterized as a monumental narrative that steps into the tradition of theodicy, which seeks to reconcile God's goodness with the existence of evil. However, it diverges, substituting divine revelation with the obscure and inscrutable concept of the sublime, epitomized by the White Whale - an entity beyond human comprehension. The characters Ishmael and Ahab depict contrasting approaches to engaging with the sublime, with Ahab showcasing defiant vengeance and Ishmael striving for a nuanced artistic representation. This exploration of the sublime reveals its power to showcase the unexplainable, leading to a transformative and sometimes terrifying awareness that transcends rationality. This is evidenced in Ishmael's futile attempts to encapsulate the whale's terrifying whiteness, a paradox of color theory, and its representation of the vast, incomprehensible ocean.

### 30. Ode to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley - Ode to the West Wind and Mont Blanc: Shelley and the Method of the Sublime by David Brendan Hopes

#### Key Idea:
Shelley's poetry embodies a natural sublimity, creating a barrier of understanding for those not accustomed to his elevated and often elusive vocabulary.

#### Summary:
In Shelley's poetry, the concept of the 'sublime' includes both a physical and metaphysical element, representing a passage to elevated perception or a higher state of being. Shelley's poetic approach inherently operates on this elevated, 'sublime' plane, which often makes his work appear obscure to those not immersed in this level of perception.

### 31. Song of Myself by Walt Whitman - The Sublime Self: Whitman's Sense of the Sublime in Song of Myself by David Brendan Hopes

#### Key Idea:
Whitman diverges from the traditional sublime, embracing a uniquely American interpretation that prioritizes will and self-assertion over surrender.

#### Summary:
Despite the inherent sublimity found in American architecture and geography, American poets, including Whitman, often shy away from the conventional sublime, characterized by exclusion and elevation. Instead, Whitman's approach to the sublime is distinctly American, emphasizing will and self-glorification over the surrender and selective appreciation commonly associated with the traditional sublime. This creates a tension between the classic concept of the sublime and the American poetic idiom, which tends to reject a sense of surrender, integral to the traditional sublime.

### 32. The Poetry of William Butler Yeats - Yeats: Tragic Joy and the Sublime by Jahan R. Ramazani

#### Key Idea:
Yeats' poetry embodies a "tragic joy", intertwining terror and joy through violent imagery and fragmented depictions, creating a unique interpretation of the sublime.

#### Summary:
Jahan Ramazani critically analyses Yeats' poetry within the post-Romantic tradition, focusing on the poems' evocation of 'tragic joy,' a distinctive form of the sublime. This entails a movement from terror to joy (psychological sublime), facilitated through violent imagery and fragmented representations (rhetorical sublime). This approach to the sublime often results in a complex interplay between death and the affirmation of life, creating a dynamic psychoanalytic structure wherein the threats from destructive paternal figures are internalized, allowing a transformation of defensive energies into joy. Despite the underlying illusion of the sublime joy, Yeats' poems depict an intense collision of external and internal realities, offering a deep, affective movement in the representation of the sublime.
