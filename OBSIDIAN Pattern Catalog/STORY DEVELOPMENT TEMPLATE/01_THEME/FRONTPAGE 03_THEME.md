> **01 THEME** - Theme serves as the foundational concept around which a story is built. The story, in turn, expands upon this concept by offering diverse perspectives on the theme, conveyed through the various elements of storytelling such as characters, events, and narrative components. These variations help deepen our understanding and exploration of the underlying theme.

### Additional Information 
	Mckee and Bloom are the two foundational authors I reference when creating themes.
