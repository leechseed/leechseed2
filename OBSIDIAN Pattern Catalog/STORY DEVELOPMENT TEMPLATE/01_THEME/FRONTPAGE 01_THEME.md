> **01 THEME** - Theme serves as the foundational concept around which a story is built. The story, in turn, expands upon this concept by offering diverse perspectives on the theme, conveyed through the various elements of storytelling such as characters, events, and narrative components.

## Bloom's 15 Themes 

*Each one of these 15 themes is identified by Bloom to be universal in literature, at least in terms of his modern cannon from a North American Perspective. After reading each one of these books I have found myself identifying with the narratives presented in each of these universal themes. I believe they can serve as overall topos or overarching themes present in every one of my novels.
