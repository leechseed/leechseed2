## 6. **Postmodern Theoretical Movements**
Explore postmodern influences on your story.

- **Incorporation of New Theories**:
  - Are movements like structuralism, feminism, or queer theory present or influencing your narrative theme?
  - How do these movements serve or challenge your story?

## 7. **Literature as Discourse**
Determine the role of social life and conventions in your story.

- **Representation of Reality**:
  - How does your narrative theme engage with societal conventions, history, or cultural codes?
  - Does your story challenge or uphold these conventions?

## 8. **Interplay Between Literature and Interpretation**
Align your story with theories of reading.

- **Reading Alignment**:
  - Formalist: Is your story best read for its style or form?
  - Social Text: Should readers engage with your story as a cultural critique?

### Crafting a Compelling Narrative Theme: A Psychoanalytic and Formalist Approach

#### Step 1: Unearth the Unconscious Desires of Your Characters
*Drawing inspiration from psychoanalysis, let’s plunge into the psyche of your characters.*
1. **Character's Conscious Desires**:
   - List the primary goals and desires of your main character(s).
   - What are they actively pursuing or avoiding?

2. **Character's Unconscious Desires**:
   - Based on clues (dreams, slips of the tongue, memories):
     - What might your character secretly desire or fear?
     - How might these unconscious desires conflict with their conscious ones?

3. **Symbols and Archetypes**:
   - What symbols might represent your character's unconscious desires?
   - Are there universal symbols (Jungian archetypes) that can be integrated into the narrative to hint at these deeper desires?

#### Step 2: Delve into Literary Symbolism and Dreams
*Psychoanalysis believes in the power of symbols and dreams. Use them to add depth.*
1. **Dream Sequences**:
   - Can a dream sequence be incorporated to reveal a character's internal conflict or hidden desires?
   - How will you apply Freud's dream-work processes (like condensation or displacement) to craft this sequence?

2. **Symbols in the Narrative**:
   - Identify three main symbols to weave into your story.
   - What unconscious desires or fears do these symbols represent?

#### Step 3: Embrace Formalist Principles for Literary Depth
*Let's shift gears to focus on the structural and stylistic components of your narrative.*
1. **Narrative Structure**:
   - Outline the primary events and turning points in your story.
   - How can you arrange these events to maximize the impact of your theme?

2. **Inherent Features and Literariness**:
   - Identify the distinctive literary features of your narrative.
     - How does your language differ from ordinary discourse?
     - Which stylistic elements (like metaphors, similes, or unique sentence structures) will you employ?

3. **Objective Analysis Over Subjectivity**:
   - How can you ensure your narrative focuses on the story's internal elements rather than external influences?
   - Are there moments where the narrative can be self-referential, drawing attention to its own construction?

#### Step 4: Resolve or Highlight Conflicts
*Combining both psychoanalytic and formalist insights, craft a resolution (or lack thereof) to your narrative.*
1. **Character's Inner Conflict**:
   - How does the character's conscious and unconscious desires create conflict within the narrative?
   - Will this conflict be resolved? If so, how?

2. **Symbolic Resolutions**:
   - Will any symbols or archetypes play a role in the story’s climax or resolution?
   - How might they shed light on the character’s internal transformation or realizations?

3. **Narrative Conclusion**:
   - How does the narrative structure and form reflect the resolution of your story?
   - What formalist elements (like specific stylistic devices or linguistic patterns) will you use in the story’s climax or conclusion?

#### Step 5: Review and Refinement
*Having combined insights from both theories, refine your narrative for maximum impact.*
1. **Character Depth and Development**:
   - Review your character’s journey. Is their internal conflict compelling and believable?
   - Are their unconscious desires hinted at subtly throughout the narrative?

2. **Stylistic and Structural Coherence**:
   - Is your narrative consistent in its style and structure?
   - Are formalist elements harmoniously integrated, enhancing the story without overpowering it?

3. **Theme Resonance**:
   - Reflect on the overarching theme of your story. 
   - Does it resonate throughout the narrative, both in its psychoanalytic symbols and its formalist construction?

#### Step 6: Seek Feedback
*Finally, get feedback to ensure your combined approach is both subtle and impactful.*
1. **Character and Symbol Feedback**:
   - Ask beta readers if they found the character's desires (both conscious and unconscious) compelling.
   - Were the symbols and dream sequences intriguing and meaningful?

2. **Formalist Elements Feedback**:
   - Ask readers about the narrative's style and structure.
   - Did the formalist elements enhance or detract from their reading experience?

Using the combined insights of psychoanalysis and formalism, this worksheet will help authors craft a compelling narrative theme with depth, intrigue, and literary finesse.

   - What controversial skills or ideas might they propagate?
     - The art of argumentation:
     - The focus on eloquence over virtue:

3. **Embracing the "Encomium of Helen" Style**

5. **Dissecting Reasons for Character Decisions**
   - Dive deeper into the aforementioned reasons:
     - **Divine Influence or Destiny**:
       - How do characters and society perceive fate's role in decision-making?
       - Are they empathetic or critical?
     - **Coercion or Assault**:
