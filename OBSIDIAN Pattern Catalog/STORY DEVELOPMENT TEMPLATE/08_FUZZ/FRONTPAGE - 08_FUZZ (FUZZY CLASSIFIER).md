> **08_FUZZ** *(Fuzzy Classifier)* - In the context of genre classification, a "fuzzy classifier" refers to a system that categorizes works not based on rigid, defined boundaries, but rather on a continuum of characteristics and traits that might overlap across various genres. This approach recognizes the fluid nature of genres, where a piece of work can possess elements of multiple genres simultaneously, allowing for a more nuanced categorization. This way, the fuzzy classifier accommodates the complexity and diversity found in literature, possibly providing a more rounded view of a work's stylistic and thematic composition.
